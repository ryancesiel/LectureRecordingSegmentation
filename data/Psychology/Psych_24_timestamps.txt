00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:29,670

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,980
PROFESSOR: So we began just a
few months ago with this goal

11
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,250
of trying to understand the
scientific study of human

12
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,930
nature, how our mind operates,
why we behave the way we do.

13
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,410
From the brain basis, how we see
and hear the world, how we

14
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,680
think, how we feel, our
predispositions to act in

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,870
certain ways, how we develop
from infancy to adolescence to

16
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,100
adulthood, through the
middle ages and into

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,880
old age, we all hope.

18
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,590
The remarkably odd things
about human social

19
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,140
interactions, which are
just amazing I think.

20
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,180
And the challenges that so
many people face, with a

21
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,440
degree of vulnerability in these
very kinds of abilities

22
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,010
and behaviors.

23
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,480
And so it's hard to know
what to conclude on.

24
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,360
So I thought I would touch
on two things.

25
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,580
One, sort of fun to think about,
hard to know how to

26
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,510
think about scientifically.

27
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:24,170
And one, it probably matters
to us all the time.

28
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,250
So let me talk about this.

29
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,190
So when we think about why we
do things, how our brain is

30
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:33,020
organized, mind is organized,
we know that we've evolved

31
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,770
over a long period of time,
from other species.

32
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,270
And that many things in us
reflect this evolutionary

33
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:42,630
history, cast into a modern,
unimaginable world from the

34
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,440
viewpoint of biology.

35
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,600
But here we are, sort of
creatures from the past living

36
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,620
in an incredibly accelerated,
changing environment.

37
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,240
And so evolutionary psychology,
people say, let's

38
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,500
try to identify why we have
certain patterns of thoughts

39
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,605
and feelings, given the
evolutionary history of our

40
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:04,240
minds and brains.

41
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,160
And I'll say a word
about that.

42
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,690
It's tough in many ways though
to have, as much as you

43
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,630
believe that's true, it's got to
be true, it's very tough to

44
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,070
approach scientifically.

45
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,590
Because often, it comes down
to people telling fun,

46
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,510
interesting, clever stories.

47
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,090
Very hard to test.

48
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,690
So we know it's a big part of
who we are, in a deep sense

49
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,120
where we came from.

50
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,120
Very hard to test
experimentally.

51
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,610
But I'll show you a couple
examples where people have

52
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,980
probed this a bit.

53
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,495
And then another question is
in the last decade, some

54
00:02:32,495 --> 00:02:34,960
people have said, well so much
of psychology seems to focus

55
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,530
on the negative, the harm
we're willing to do, the

56
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,340
stereotypes we're
willing to hold.

57
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,690
How about positive psychology?

58
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,050
How about thinking about what
can we learn from psychology

59
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,660
to lead a better, happier,
more meaningful life.

60
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,260
As I'm going to tell you about
the core results about

61
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,280
research about happiness.

62
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,730
And some of them I think
will surprise you.

63
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,910
Some of them, you'll tuck in the
back of your mind maybe,

64
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,900
as you think about what
will make you happy.

65
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,510
I mean we all want to be
happy in a deep sense.

66
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,620
We don't know what's on the
other side of this life.

67
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,460
But we know this is the one
we have in our hands.

68
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:13,210
And so what can psychology
suggest that might make you

69
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,600
think what's a path
to happiness?

70
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,890
So we talked about throughout
this course about the fragile

71
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,350
power of the human brain.

72
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,010
It endows us with an
unbelievable capacity for

73
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,410
thought, sight, behavior,
vulnerabilities at every

74
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,890
stage, from neurological
injuries to

75
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,890
neuropsychiatric disorders.

76
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:34,020
And again, we know this all has
grown through this Paul

77
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,670
MacLean triune brain idea, that
within us are kind of a

78
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:41,020
version of reptilian brains,
within us are simple mammalian

79
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,030
brains, and then finally
the primate and

80
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,190
human expanded neocortex.

81
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,110
And so within us, it's almost
as if we represent in a

82
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,280
certain sense, our species
history, literally in your

83
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,160
brain, literally right now,
in some complex way of

84
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,040
interactions.

85
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,090
With parts of the brain that
have evolved modestly and

86
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,650
parts that evolved spectacularly
in humans.

87
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:06,210

88
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,540
And the usual story, you're used
to this in evolution, is

89
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,640
that our brains and minds
evolved in nature.

90
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,910
And natural selection was the
dominating part of the story.

91
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,399
Survival of the fittest for
passing genes into the next

92
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:22,100
generation, that sort of all
stories boil down to that.

93
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,150
And I'm going to tell you
two specific examples.

94
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,070
One that surprised me and then
one that's just sort of fun I

95
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,730
think in a silly way.

96
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,340
So the first one is attitudes
towards race and sex.

97
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,000
And this can came up.

98
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,380
And then the second one is
different attitudes in men and

99
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,600
women, who might have in terms
of sex and procreation.

100
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,040
So let me focus on this
for a moment.

101
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,290
In the last election, you may
remember that there was a

102
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:53,410
long, grueling race across the
primaries between Hillary

103
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,070
Clinton and Barack Obama.

104
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:59,160
And in many ways, this is a huge
surprise in the United

105
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,870
States, because with such a
history of racism and sexism,

106
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,750
the idea that the two leading
candidates are a woman and an

107
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,660
African American, was just
kind of an amazing thing.

108
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,810

109
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,510
As much as we had distance
to go, that we

110
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,640
have come that far.

111
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,140
That these were the two
candidates on the Democratic

112
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,240
side, who are competing state
to state across the country,

113
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,370
one of whom would become
the Democratic

114
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,890
nominee and the President.

115
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,710
And I got call from a reporter
from the Boston Globe.

116
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,410
And he said, he was writing a
story saying, which is the

117
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:34,220
worst problem these candidates
faced, sexism or racism?

118
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,650
And many of us, and I'm no
exception, our egos get turned

119
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,120
up when somebody from
the press calls.

120
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,740
Because our name will
be in the newspaper.

121
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,770
And we can show it to our
friends and family.

122
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,940
And then they know we have a
real job and somebody thinks

123
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,750
we know something.

124
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,200
You laugh.

125
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,380
And the graduate students,
like their parents never

126
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,570
understand anything,
except when their

127
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,700
name gets in the newspaper.

128
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,300
You know how that is, right?

129
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,850
So I thought, well, I'm going to
say something really clever

130
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,510
and all the neuroscience and
all the psychology I know,

131
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,410
either from my own research or
for teaching this course.

132
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,080
I'll have something.

133
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,160
And I just had nothing to say.

134
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,820
I mean we can agree
that racism is bad

135
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,970
and sexism is bad.

136
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:12,380
And it's kind of excellent that
candidates are beating

137
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:16,710
those glass ceilings in the
national leadership.

138
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,265
We know from research on things
like the IAT test, that

139
00:06:19,265 --> 00:06:21,120
you heard about, that both
remain a problem.

140
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,380
Negative stereotypes of certain
kinds remain in our

141
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,700
society to this day,
across society.

142
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,770
So I was like, which is worst,
terrible thing A or

143
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:32,800
terrible thing B?

144
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,000
And I had nothing to say.

145
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,290
And then a newspaper article
came out and said, oh,

146
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:41,320
according to evolutionary
psychologists, and I was not

147
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,580
included, because I
nothing to say.

148
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,530
This was very sad.

149
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:48,370
They said well, really Hillary
Clinton faces the harder path.

150
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,740
Because in their mind, sexism
is built into our species.

151
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,310
Because the whole idea of how
we procreate, how men and

152
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:58,360
women relate in species and
investments, that's deep in

153
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,580
us, all through evolution.

154
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,320
Whereas racism is culturally
specific and malleable.

155
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,990
There's countries where one
group is picked on.

156
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,170
There's countries where another
group is picked on.

157
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,570
There's changes in societies.

158
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,050
That's a changeable thing.

159
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,260
This is a tougher thing
to change, was their

160
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:15,920
interpretation.

161
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,440
I thought well, that
sounds good.

162
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,490
And it might even be true.

163
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,490
It's like a lot of evolutionary
psychology, a

164
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,510
good possibility, a better
answer by infinitely far than

165
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,640
I could give.

166
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,980
But who knows?

167
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,980
And then this one study came
out, that's kind of curious.

168
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,320
So this is a study of children
with Williams syndrome, a rare

169
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,880
disorder, but very studied in
both human genetics and human

170
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,770
psychology.

171
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:41,950
And partly, it's interesting.

172
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,690
These are the unusual
facial features of

173
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,060
these kinds of children.

174
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,630
They're born this way.

175
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,540
And it's caused by deletion of
26 genes from the long arm of

176
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,410
chromosome 7.

177
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:54,180
It's one of the most purely
defined and specific genetic

178
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,970
developmental disorders
in humans.

179
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,110
So it's really drawn the
interest of geneticists.

180
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:03,490
Because it's a disorder that's
really very linked to a very

181
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:08,790
specific part of the human
genome always.

182
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,760
Distinctive, what they call
elfin facial features,

183
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,330
developmentally delayed
language skills.

184
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:19,570
And maybe the most curious and
charming element is unusually

185
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,800
cheerful demeanor and
ease with strangers.

186
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,150
These are the children who will
walk up to strangers and

187
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:29,140
talk your ear off and not be
afraid of anybody or anything.

188
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,159
To an extent that's charming,
can get you in trouble with

189
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,740
the world being the way it is.

190
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,429
It's sometimes contrasted
with autism.

191
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:39,700
Because individual with autism
find social interactions

192
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,880
sometimes laborious, difficult,
mysterious.

193
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,320
These individuals find it
delightful, nonstop.

194
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,590
You get tired sometimes of
talking to such children,

195
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,570
because they're ready to go
infinitely in terms of social

196
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,070
interaction.

197
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,680
And there's been some study
that they have atypical

198
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,690
amygdala function and lack
of fear response there.

199
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,800
So that's the background about
Williams syndrome.

200
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,370
And then somebody
did a IAT study.

201
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,270
This was in France.

202
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:05,150
But its been replicated since.

203
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,990
That shows that for these
children with Williams

204
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:11,100
syndrome, they still have
a gender IAT effect.

205
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,000
That is for example, they're
willing to consider women less

206
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,990
likely to be good at
science and math,

207
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,290
which we know is silly.

208
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,270
But that's the stereotype.

209
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,810
But they showed no racial
IAT effect.

210
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,660
And they had control
participants who showed both.

211
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,340
So now, there's still
interpretation.

212
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:31,920
But all of sudden, it's as if
this is deeper in the brain.

213
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,650
And maybe this is learned.

214
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,900
And these children aren't
learning this one.

215
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,000
But they can't stop this one.

216
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,090
So a suggestion that there is
something true about this

217
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,160
evolutionary psychology thing.

218
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,390
And that maybe the hardest thing
for us to change deep

219
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:50,770
down, because of the fundamental
sexual relations

220
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,310
in procreation.

221
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:55,340
That's a hard thing for us to
work our head around, without

222
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,160
being thoughtful and
careful about it.

223
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,810
So here's an experiment that
was used to demonstrate.

224
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,610
So what's the usual story?

225
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:06,440
The usual story in evolution
is people on average, not

226
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,830
everybody of course,
wants to have kids.

227
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,870
Because that's how they
pass their genes down.

228
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:13,300
And who has a lot of investment
per kid, in however

229
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,710
way you look it?

230
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,520
Women.

231
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,080
For women it's, just the first
part is nine months.

232
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,570
And then the immediate
support.

233
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:26,240
For men, how long is the
minimal contribution?

234
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:26,970
15 seconds.

235
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,170
OK, well 15 minutes.

236
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:29,860
It varies.

237
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,110
But you know.

238
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:33,260

239
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,180
So there's a theory that if the
thing you cared about was

240
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,740
just getting us your genes down

241
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,370
there as much as possible.

242
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,230
Was it Wilt Chamberlain, the
former basketball player, who

243
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,850
said he had slept with
1,000 women.

244
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:47,620
That he would be like the
champion example in men.

245
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,230
And with women, it's you can't
do a 1,000 nine-month cycles.

246
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,190
So that for men, if that
was the only thing in

247
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,120
life, and it's not.

248
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,260
But here's the experiment
they did.

249
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,200
We couldn't have an
IRB approve this.

250
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,450
But this was done
at a university.

251
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,610
And they said, we're going
to show you an

252
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,450
experiment like this.

253
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,680
And this is meant to
be kind of silly.

254
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,690
But this is how evolutionary

255
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:07,850
psychology, things are expressed.

256
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,450
And it's kind of
funny, I think.

257
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,870
We'll see.

258
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,656
So what they would do is they
pick take an attractive man

259
00:11:13,656 --> 00:11:14,520
and an attractive woman.

260
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,440
They were the confederates.

261
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,880
And they would approach a
student leaving the library, a

262
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,090
random student.

263
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,400
And here's the responder,
who is a woman.

264
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,620
Imagine yourself as women now,
for those of you who are

265
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,560
woman, leaving a library, kind
of late at night, not too

266
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:27,870
threatening.

267
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:32,180
But somebody walks up to you and
says, I've noticed you in

268
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,540
the library a few times.

269
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,260
You seem very nice.

270
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,890
Do you think there's any chance
we could get together

271
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:40,000
for a date sometime?

272
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,090
What percentage of
women said yes?

273
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:48,155
In this study, 50%.

274
00:11:48,155 --> 00:11:50,680
Do you think that's high?

275
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,800
Let's pretend it was
a better approach

276
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,376
than what I just said.

277
00:11:57,376 --> 00:11:59,450
I tried to make it low
key and nice, a

278
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,700
low key, nice approach.

279
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,810

280
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,230
For other women, the same male
confederate walks up and says,

281
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,050
I've noticed you in library.

282
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,490
You seem very nice.

283
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:12,570
What do you about going back
to my apartment and having

284
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:13,820
some coffee?

285
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,810

286
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:16,510
We'll take turns then.

287
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,160
Women, what do you think
is the number?

288
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,630
We start with 50.

289
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:20,880
What?

290
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,130
20.

291
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:26,300

292
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,540
I noticed you in the library.

293
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,290
You seem very nice.

294
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:31,010
I think there's something
compatible between us.

295
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,715
What do you think about going
back to my apartment and

296
00:12:32,715 --> 00:12:33,965
having sex right now?

297
00:12:33,965 --> 00:12:36,430

298
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,820
See finally, the course
gets super practical.

299
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:44,740

300
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,400
I'm not saying it.

301
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,580
This is just one study.

302
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,540
Now, we reverse the roles.

303
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,040
Men, you get ready, all right?

304
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,040
An attractive woman walks up to
you and says, I noticed in

305
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,450
the library.

306
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,590
You seem very friendly.

307
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,030
We seem to be compatible.

308
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,574
Would you be willing to have
a date with me some time?

309
00:12:58,574 --> 00:12:59,824
AUDIENCE: 100%.

310
00:12:59,824 --> 00:13:02,660

311
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:06,530
PROFESSOR: Would you be willing,
the woman says to the

312
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:10,230
man, to go back to my apartment
with me right now?

313
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:18,780

314
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,770
All right, you know
where this going.

315
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,210
An attractive woman walks
up to the man.

316
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,560
And she says, would you go back
to my apartment to have

317
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,990
sex with me this very minute?

318
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:32,290

319
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,750
The guys got things to do.

320
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,610
You now, he can't--

321
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:36,100
Yeah?

322
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

323
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,580
PROFESSOR: What is the
citation for this?

324
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,090
Let me get that.

325
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,460
I heard it in a talk.

326
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:42,520
And I saw the numbers.

327
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,850
The numbers are correct.

328
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,820
I have to say when this was
presented, there was some

329
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,360
murmuring, because maybe it
wasn't quite IRB-approved.

330
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,540
I heard it from a good source.

331
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,860
I'll get that for you.

332
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,110
It's in your notes.

333
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:59,690

334
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:02,560
So evolutionary psychology,
whatever, it's kind of fun.

335
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,340
But it's hard to know
where it gets you.

336
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,360
But it's definitely
fun to talk about.

337
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,300
So happiness research.

338
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,560
So for a long time, from ancient
philosophy to the

339
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,750
founding of the US and
everything, people said, the

340
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,960
objective of life, as we choose
it, Aristotle, for

341
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,180
itself, and never for
any other reason.

342
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,640
And one of the most amazing
phrases in the Declaration of

343
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,290
independence, "We hold these
truths to be self-evident,

344
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:25,890
that all men are created equal,
that they are endowed

345
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,800
by their Creator with certain
unalienable Rights, that among

346
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,560
these are life and liberty."
Well, that we would think

347
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,970
would be obvious things, now.

348
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,220
But this amazing thing, "and
the pursuit of Happiness."

349
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,350
As important as life itself
and liberty itself, the

350
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,270
pursuit of happiness.

351
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:42,320
And I think we know that in our
own lives, as we relate to

352
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,350
other people, as we pursue
careers, as we do things,

353
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:50,220
where we put our limited
lifetime resources, time and

354
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,390
effort, we all want to end up in
a deep way to be happy and

355
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:56,030
make the choices to get there.

356
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,570
So we can think on average, you
could think in your head

357
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,720
what makes you happy, what
makes you want unhappy?

358
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,430
And a standard list
might be, people

359
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,330
definitely want to be healthy.

360
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,420
Nobody minds being wealthy.

361
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,140
We'll talk about that.

362
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,610
It never hurts to get
a new car, a new TV,

363
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,230
or new stuff, right?

364
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,110
What makes you unhappy?

365
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,390
Physical injury, emotional
injury.

366
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:20,080
I mean that would be
kind of standard.

367
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,680
Now, how do you measure
happiness?

368
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,590
And this is the part where you
get us into the funniness of

369
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,100
psychology.

370
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,220
So you have with you a
questionnaire, which is one of

371
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,620
the most widely used measures
of happiness.

372
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,670
So I'll just give you a
moment to look at it.

373
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,740
You could fill it out
for yourself.

374
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,080
We're not going to collect it.

375
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,580
And you may even want
to or whatever.

376
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,920
But just to get a
feeling of this.

377
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,140
And you could say--

378
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:42,980
oh, sorry.

379
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,190
Anybody else who didn't
get it, that we

380
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,440
could help you with?

381
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,100

382
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,135
A few hands over here.

383
00:15:49,135 --> 00:15:50,385
Oh, thank you.

384
00:15:50,385 --> 00:15:54,070

385
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,570
Again, let me say whoever did
this amazing display is maybe

386
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:57,210
super happy.

387
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,120
So you're ahead of me.

388
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,370
Thank you.

389
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:03,560

390
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,070
So it's measured
in life value.

391
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,830
You ask the person like
basically, how happy are you?

392
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,810
And we have a tendency to be
suspicious of just asking

393
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:11,670
people straight on.

394
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,080
Because if we ask them straight
on, would you say

395
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,160
this line is as big as
this line, if three

396
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:17,710
other people said that?

397
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,190
You'd say, no, not me.

398
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:22,660
If you say, would you zap
somebody until you think

399
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,340
they're dead in another room?

400
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,890
You'd say no, not me.

401
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:29,300
So we're very suspicious about
what people say they will do

402
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,830
and what they really do.

403
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:34,440
But for happiness research,
it's hard to beat that.

404
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,040
Here's another one.

405
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,920
You can circle the happiness
that represents you.

406
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,560
Because what's the better
question, what's the more

407
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,450
objective measure to decide that
somebody's happy, a brain

408
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,080
image, a blood test?

409
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,290
We don't have a better thing
than the person's own

410
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,630
statement about their
sense of happiness.

411
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,790
All the way back to a Roman
philosopher, "The happy man is

412
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:57,170
not he who seems thus to others,
but who seems thus to

413
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:01,850
himself." We don't know of a
better way to ask you if

414
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,230
you're happy, than to
ask if you're happy.

415
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,050
So it's not the most satisfying
kind of objective,

416
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,660
scientific measure.

417
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,349
But maybe it's the life
we lead anywhere.

418
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:13,770
We decide if we're happy
or not, in some sense.

419
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:18,359
So if you ask people on average
how happy they are,

420
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,760
2/3 of the people will put
themselves here, almost

421
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,099
everybody above average.

422
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:25,764
A few people report that they're
consistently unhappy.

423
00:17:25,764 --> 00:17:28,880

424
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,850
And I'm going to come back to
this, but the thing that

425
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,960
struck happiness researchers,
surprisingly modest

426
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,380
influences, and I'm going to
touch this up a little bit

427
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,970
with a research study, of social
status, income, gender,

428
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:41,600
or ethnicity.

429
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,200
A number of things that you
could have thought would touch

430
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:49,690
that, surprisingly don't touch
it, or in very limited ways.

431
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:53,160
But I'll tell you a little bit
about those limited ways.

432
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,990
So on a seven-point scale,
the average is 4 or a 5.

433
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,010
College students, 4.9.

434
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,050
Older people, happier.

435
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,130
We've talk about that before.

436
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,710
Ironically, even though older
people probably face more

437
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:07,930
challenges in various ways and
limited life spans, they seem

438
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,180
happier by self-report.

439
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,190

440
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:16,910
One argument that income has
little relationship is this

441
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,410
kind of a graph, that looks at
the average income in the US

442
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,540
from 1930 to 1991.

443
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,650
So here's this increase, that's
not going up anymore.

444
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,160
But it was in the
last century.

445
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,980
And self-reported happiness.

446
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,650
And you can see that at some
point, it goes up, but then it

447
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,750
flattens out.

448
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,830
So the general thought analysis,
I'll show you a

449
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:44,020
little bit more detail, is, not
much money or in current

450
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:47,570
situations, poverty,
does strike down

451
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,200
people's sense of happiness.

452
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,660
But once you get above some
threshold, and of course, what

453
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,770
that threshold is varies in so
many ways depending on who you

454
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,310
are and what you expect, but
once you get above some

455
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,480
threshold, that's not
the biggest part

456
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,020
of the story anymore.

457
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:05,770
And that's pretty much
a general finding.

458
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,570
They've done all kinds
of surveys about

459
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,220
happiness across countries.

460
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,410
It's a really interesting
thing about happiness

461
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,650
research, it's more powerful
than you can imagine in

462
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:16,900
grabbing hold of the minds of
many people in public policy.

463
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,380
Derek Bok, the former president
of Harvard, has

464
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,750
written a book suggesting that
happiness research ought to be

465
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,490
the basis of public policies
by the government.

466
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:30,210
That if know what makes people
happy, short of giving

467
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,070
everybody $1 million every year,
why wouldn't you tweak

468
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:36,610
every policy, even if people
don't think it will make them

469
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:39,510
happy, but you know from
research it will?

470
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,480
And then here's a world map,
where they surveyed people all

471
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,310
over the place.

472
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,260
The darker the color,
the more people

473
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,810
reported themselves happy.

474
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:50,090
Now, this is very tricky.

475
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:53,320
Because now you're in full
scale, there's things like

476
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,610
poverty, but there's also things
like cultural emphases.

477
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:59,470
In the US, we talk a lot
about happiness.

478
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:02,110
That concept is less prevalent
in many other cultures,

479
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,300
relatively speaking.

480
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,320
So it's hard to know how much
is the culture, how much is

481
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:10,040
the actual per capita
income relevant.

482
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,240
But people are pursuing
these things.

483
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,530
And they are finding roughly--

484
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:17,060
the most recent one, that
again in countries where

485
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:21,040
there's a lot of poverty, it's
less than in countries where

486
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,980
you start to have
higher incomes.

487
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,270
So poverty is still associated
with less happiness.

488
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:31,250
And you can guess that
is reasonable.

489
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,530
And then more studies
like this,

490
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,580
again about that direction.

491
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:41,730
So early on, people said
that income has

492
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,130
nothing to do with happiness.

493
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,500
And that seems not quite right,
especially at the lower

494
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,380
end of poverty.

495
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:50,280
Now, Dan Kahneman, the Nobel
Laureate, a psychologist at

496
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,910
Princeton, has spent the last
few years talking about what

497
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,440
he calls the focusing
illusion.

498
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,505
And let me tell you
what that is.

499
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:59,080
It's basically this, when
thinking about one topic, it

500
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,070
could be income, could be
graduate school admissions.

501
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:05,280
Like whatever the topic is,
fairness, whatever the topic

502
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,950
is, when you're thinking about
that one topic, people tend to

503
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,850
attribute more importance to
that topic than it really has.

504
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:13,400
They think it accounts for more
of what goes in the world

505
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,730
when they're focused on it.

506
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,950
And you see this all the time
in political discussions.

507
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,350
Like it's all the deficit.

508
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,440
If we just fix the deficit,
everything works.

509
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,520
It's all raising taxes.

510
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,670
If we just do this.

511
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:24,220
People fixate on one thing.

512
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,240
And then that's the answer
to the whole problem.

513
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,960
That all the time, never mind
political debates where things

514
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,380
might be staged, but
even in one's own

515
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,920
personal life, that happens.

516
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,170
Let me give you an example
of how they

517
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,700
showed that to be true.

518
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,800
They have people rate their
happiness, just like you have.

519
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,880
And then they ask them, and
these were, how many dates for

520
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,070
the single people, how many
dates in the last month?

521
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,890
And they get no correlation
between self-rated happiness

522
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,720
and how many dates you've
had in the last month.

523
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,140
Now they were reverse
for some people,

524
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,590
the order of questions.

525
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:55,785
How many dates have you had in
the last month and now rate

526
00:21:55,785 --> 00:21:56,490
your happiness.

527
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:57,990
And they get a positive
correlation.

528
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:01,800
The more dates you had, the
happier your report yourself.

529
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,710
Well, for people who are dating,
on average, that's a

530
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,970
measure, like getting out there
and meeting people.

531
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:10,190
It's an average of succeeding
in some path

532
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,360
you want to be on.

533
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,220
So when you just thought about
this, you said, whoa, if I had

534
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:18,280
no dates this past month, I
must be pretty miserable.

535
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,090
I'm pretty unhappy.

536
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,240
I'm thinking about that.

537
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,980
And all the other elements of
your life that contribute to

538
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,360
happiness, because you
just focused on that.

539
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,980
You just focused on that because
the question was

540
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,520
asked, recede
disproportionately, compared

541
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,620
to the actual importance.

542
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,440
If you go the other way around,
how happy you are, and

543
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,980
you ask this, there's no
correlation, because you're

544
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,370
not thinking about this one
thing and weighting your

545
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:41,470
overall happiness by this one
question or dimension.

546
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,610
Does that make sense?

547
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:46,350
So the order is the
whole story.

548
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:49,030
That people, when they think
about a topic and then think

549
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:52,650
of how happy or meaningful it
is, they overvalue that topic,

550
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,650
because they just
focused in their

551
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:58,190
minds on this one dimension.

552
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:02,110
So getting back to this issue
of income and how that goes

553
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,980
with happiness, here's what
they did, the same thing

554
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,040
again, by asking a specific
question and then asking your

555
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,020
general impression,
the same idea.

556
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:14,040
So they said, how bad was your
mood the previous day?

557
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,350
So there's a specific
question about mood.

558
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,740
Now, how much time do you think
people with various

559
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,770
income levels are
in a bad mood?

560
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,690
And they picked for example,
people making less than

561
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:28,580
$20,000 or people making
more than $100,000.

562
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,900
These people who just answered
this question said, gee--

563
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

564
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:35,590

565
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,930
PROFESSOR: I don't
see anything.

566
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:38,180
That's right.

567
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,910

568
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,160
Thank you very much.

569
00:23:42,160 --> 00:24:02,750

570
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,180
The cool thing is now
that they're making

571
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,300
videos of these lectures.

572
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,030
We have so many applicants
to be your peers in

573
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:08,710
the years to come.

574
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:11,510
It's going to be unbelievable.

575
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,880
So you guys are great.

576
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,260
So they said it was about 32%
more bad mood, if you were

577
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,530
making less or more.

578
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:22,060
If you asked people making
how much, it's only a 12%

579
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:22,400
difference.

580
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,030
It matters, but only
a third as much.

581
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,540
Because you just got
them thinking about

582
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,570
being in a bad mood.

583
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:33,830
So now they over attribute
income for daily happiness.

584
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,120
And here's a kind of
interesting thing.

585
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,880
And it's a trade-off.

586
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,440
And it gets us to what
is it in your life

587
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,740
that makes you happy.

588
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:45,140
So people making over $100,000
spend about 20% more time on--

589
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,670

590
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:48,920
I've got this reversed.

591
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,100

592
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,430
So people making over $100,000
spend more time--

593
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,210
I'll fix the slide up.

594
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:57,830
Sorry.

595
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,780
Spend more time on doing things
that they report as

596
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:05,320
being kind of stressful, work,
pressure shopping for the

597
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,180
family, pressured childcare
situations, what they call

598
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,950
obligatory tasks.

599
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:12,690
And people who make less money,
spend considerably more

600
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:16,240
time doing things that everybody
considers fun when

601
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,480
they're doing it, socializing,
or watching TV that you like.

602
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,760
So you can see it's
kind of weird.

603
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,630
It's a little bit of where you
put your time and what counts

604
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:27,035
for you to feel happy
about something.

605
00:25:27,035 --> 00:25:29,720

606
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,640
Everybody's in pretty much
agreement, like you've heard

607
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,670
about almost everything, twin
studies suggest, the set point

608
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,400
of happiness, where you rate
yourself as always

609
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,300
super-happy, moderately happy,
or somewhat grumpy, seems to

610
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:44,650
be about between 15%
and 80% heritable.

611
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:49,630
It's as if a piece of us is born
to be super-happy, medium

612
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:53,160
happy, or chronically grumpy.

613
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,150
There's not a better or worse
way to be, right?

614
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,730
So that people will call
this a set point.

615
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:00,570
So of course things happen on
a day-to-day basis, on a

616
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:02,950
moment-to-moment basis, that
push you up or down in

617
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,440
happiness, of course.

618
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,480
You'll get good news, you get
bad new, you have fearful

619
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,750
things, joyful things
coming up.

620
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,690
But the idea is that people tend
to get back pretty fast

621
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:16,220
to the set point, their level,
whatever that is, of chronic,

622
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,450
constant happiness.

623
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,610
And this is kind of an
amazing finding.

624
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:23,630
So let's take a look at that
and add one more point.

625
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:27,440
So here's extroverts by
personality measures and

626
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:27,750
introverts.

627
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:30,840
And extroverts report themselves
as being happier.

628
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,310
That's a set point example, a
personality thing that seems

629
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,720
to go over time.

630
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,650
But they share the bumpiness
of the week.

631
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:42,080
Here's how happy they are on
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday

632
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,970
whoa, weekend approaching, and
the misery of Sunday, when the

633
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:48,050
weekend is over.

634
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:51,000
So you can see in both things,
of course they're responding

635
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
to the work week cycle of heavy
work, anticipation of

636
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,290
the weekend, the weekend itself,
and anticipation of

637
00:26:58,290 --> 00:26:59,970
the work day.

638
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:00,990
Both groups do.

639
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:04,040
But the set points seem to be
a little bit different, the

640
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,700
chronic, constant level.

641
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:13,960
Now, there's been a bunch of
ideas about a question about

642
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,630
whether people can
be too happy.

643
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,360
Can a person be too happy?

644
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,220
And here's what they find.

645
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,600
That if they had take people
who say, I'm super, super,

646
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,630
super happy, and you ask them
what's going on their life

647
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:27,750
that makes some super,
super happy?

648
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:31,140
Those people often report that
it's close relations to other

649
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,200
people and often, good deeds
or volunteer work, is the

650
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,680
thing that's making them
super, super happy.

651
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,420
A little less happy on average,
but still pretty

652
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:44,360
happy, are people who have
higher incomes, higher

653
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:48,240
education, and more political
participation.

654
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,190
So look at these two things.

655
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:52,600
And you could say in your own
life, but all these things

656
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,370
will matter.

657
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:57,360
But which is the model of
success for you in your heart,

658
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,360
the human relations and doing
good or the sort of income,

659
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,990
education, active in
your world thing?

660
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,200
And it's not one is
better than other.

661
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,530
It's not you have to choose
one or the other.

662
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:10,930
But it seems like people
will tend to focus more

663
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:11,280
on one or the other.

664
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,810
All these things are matter.

665
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:16,110
But, where you put your heart.

666
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:16,810
It's easier.

667
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:18,900
Or you end up doing this,
if you're on the

668
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,380
most extensive happy.

669
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,610
So maybe if you want somebody to
do a certain thing for you,

670
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:26,345
you don't want them to be so
happy. they have to a little

671
00:28:26,345 --> 00:28:28,010
bit grumbling about stuff.

672
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,830
If you think the world is
perfect, you're not going to

673
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,080
fight for political change.

674
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,880

675
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,800
So what makes us happy?

676
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,410
And it turns out in interesting
ways, it's more

677
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:40,010
complicated than you think.

678
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,660
And so it's worth thinking
about, because your first

679
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,750
intuitions might not pan out.

680
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,500
So here's an example.

681
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,640
But I want to tell you this,
I'll remind you of this again.

682
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,620
And then switch to
every day one.

683
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:54,050
So one part of happiness is that
when we reconstruct what

684
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,710
made us happy, what made us
happy growing up as a child;

685
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,920
what made as happy as an
adolescent in high school;

686
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,810
what made us happy last year,
last month, last week, that's

687
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:03,790
all out of memory.

688
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:07,590
That's not the current moment
of joy or frustration.

689
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,800
That's your sense of what
was it all about.

690
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,850
Where was I in terms
of happiness?

691
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:17,200
And so Kahneman again did this
work looking at pain ratings

692
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,450
during a dental procedure.

693
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:21,550
And he said, what determines
your memory for

694
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,490
how painful it was?

695
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:28,600
And the two values were the
peak of the pain and the

696
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,370
ending intensity.

697
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:34,540
So that if you added a little
extra pain at the end, people

698
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,950
actually rated the
whole session in

699
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,710
memory as less painful.

700
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:42,950
You add some mild pain at the
end, rate it as painful, but

701
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,400
because it was mild, because the
last number that goes in

702
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,050
their algorithm in their mind
is the strength at the end,

703
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:51,310
and the other number seems to be
the peak, he could predict

704
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:54,010
pretty well how you would
rate the painfulness

705
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:55,300
of the entire session.

706
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,910
So this shows you that in many
ways, our minds construct our

707
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,060
definitions of happiness.

708
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,870
They're not simply our
sensory experience.

709
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:05,400

710
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,370
And here is a thing you could
think about for a moment.

711
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,860
Many of have had jobs
or something.

712
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:14,120
You haven't had, most of you,
a long work period on a

713
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,540
consistent basis, most
of you I'm guessing.

714
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:20,460
But think about are you happier
at work or vacation?

715
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:23,680
So if you ask most people are
you happier at work or

716
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,980
vacation, most people
will say vacation.

717
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:30,350
That's why I work 50 or 51 weeks
of the year to have that

718
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,600
awesome vacation.

719
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,370

720
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:38,360
If they do a study where you
carry a beeper on you and they

721
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,580
beep you every once in a while,
unexpectedly, and say,

722
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,920
OK, one to seven, how
happy are you?

723
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,120
And some days you're at the
office and some days you're on

724
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,250
your vacation, what happens?

725
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:54,670
You report yourself happier
at work, on average.

726
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:56,150
So that's amazing.

727
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,280
Why do we have vacations
at all?

728
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,830
Not to be miserable.

729
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:03,560
I mean could you imagine an ad
that said come to our hotel,

730
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,970
you'll be less miserable
than another

731
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:07,190
hotel on your vacation.

732
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,100
That wouldn't work.

733
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,370
What do think is
going on here?

734
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:14,920

735
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,910
This is the finding.

736
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:18,130
What's going on here in the
interpretation is, when we

737
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:20,920
think ahead about a vacation or
when we reconstruct in our

738
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,270
mind, there's some things
about it that make

739
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:26,310
us like it a lot.

740
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,620
When we're on the vacation, and
you may know this, and I

741
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,620
think part of it is the
anticipation of vacation

742
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,860
sometimes, what happens?

743
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,840
The hotel wasn't so good.

744
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,920
You got that food poisoning that
ruined the whole trip.

745
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,980
Your brother or sister were
really a nuisance.

746
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,610
Your parents were a drag.

747
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:44,530
Your parents can't understand
why you were so sulky.

748
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:47,660
It's was like you didn't have
the space to separate out and

749
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:51,710
get yourself all sorted out.

750
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,900
I had that too as a kid.

751
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,760
I mean sometimes whatever little
conflicts you had at

752
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,520
home seem to get exaggerated
when you're jammed in

753
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,070
together, for long periods
in cars or

754
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,990
rooms or tents or whatever.

755
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:04,800
And then you go that home and in
a couple weeks you go man,

756
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,650
that was an awesome vacation.

757
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:07,450
I'll never forget it.

758
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,690
It means so much to me.

759
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:10,700
And it's not that you're
faking it.

760
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,820
You really feel that.

761
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,930
Otherwise, you wouldn't get
ready for the next vacation,

762
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:15,390
the next year.

763
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:18,320
So what this suggests is, in
ourselves, really there's at

764
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,270
least two ways, or two minds,
thinking about happiness.

765
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,490
One is a moment to
moment happiness.

766
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:26,700
That's real.

767
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,110
And one is a sort
of big picture,

768
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:31,700
what is my life about.

769
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,180
And I feel like my life about is
going to interesting places

770
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,480
with people I care about.

771
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,730
That's a vacation.

772
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:39,630

773
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,040
It's not that people
are hypocritical.

774
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,390
It's that in them there's these
different dimensions of

775
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:46,750
happiness that are tapped by
different moments of thought.

776
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:49,670

777
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:52,790
Happiness researchers, their
most controversial topic,

778
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,840
because they can explain almost
everything in the story

779
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,370
I just told you, is children.

780
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:02,180
So you talk to parents.

781
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:08,100
And over 33% will say the single
biggest thing that's

782
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,190
the joy in their life is
having children or

783
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,020
grandchildren.

784
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:12,930
That's a very common thing.

785
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:14,900
You could say you're surprised
it's not more.

786
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,800
But still, it's a lot.

787
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,140
It's the single biggest thing.

788
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,820
And I think people really
mostly believe that

789
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,970
when they say that.

790
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:25,270
If you have people keep a
day-to-day diary, the

791
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:28,930
moment-to-moment source of
happiness, and they rate one

792
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:32,237
to seven, everything they just
did, so it's kind of fresh in

793
00:33:32,237 --> 00:33:39,830
their memory, childcare is rated
just over housework,

794
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:42,965
below sex, socializing with
friends, watching TV, praying,

795
00:33:42,965 --> 00:33:46,160
eating, and cooking.

796
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:50,300
Because again, it's this
weirdness of like, oh, he's

797
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,110
not doing his homework or
we're afraid she's doing

798
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:55,820
something or little kids are
just running around, not doing

799
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,900
what you ask them to do.

800
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,445
And it's so frustrating because
you can't get them.

801
00:34:00,445 --> 00:34:02,520
So happiness researchers don't
understand why people have

802
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,070
children at all.

803
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,020
They can't explain it.

804
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,240
There's a lot of effort
going on to come

805
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,030
up with some formula.

806
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:09,320
And again, it's not that people
will tell you oh, we

807
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,310
can't believe we had kids.

808
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,900
How stupid was that?

809
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:16,610
They say and they feel, it
is a phenomenal source of

810
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:17,440
happiness for them.

811
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,860
It's just when you ask them,
how about five minutes ago?

812
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,469
They go, no.

813
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:23,510
Why did he talk that way?

814
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:25,010
Why doesn't he or she
listen to me?

815
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:26,659
Why don't they clean
the room ever?

816
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:27,929
They're 25 years old.

817
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:30,020
They could make their bed.

818
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,919
Or whatever.

819
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:35,370
So it's really interesting,
these two different dimensions

820
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,150
of happiness.

821
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:39,120
So this idea that within us
there's multiple selves, the

822
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,280
moment to moment self,
that's real.

823
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,310
The big picture, what
is my life about?

824
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,090
That's real.

825
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:45,440
They're not always perfectly
aligned.

826
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,179

827
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:51,830
In the US, the moment to moment
happiness, in a recent

828
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:55,310
study, increases until
about $75,000.

829
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,080
Of course, it's an average.

830
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,860
Depending on what you need to
buy, that number will move.

831
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,990
But then it tops
out on average.

832
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:05,280
But the big picture, emotional
well-being, but overall

833
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,860
satisfaction keeps going
up with income.

834
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:09,880
Now, you have to be very
careful on these.

835
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,420
These are all correlations.

836
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,120
Everything I've told you just
about is a correlation.

837
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,380
So when you say overall
satisfaction, sort of big

838
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,920
picture sense of life goes
up with income, is

839
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,560
it really the income?

840
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,810
What else could it be?

841
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:26,910

842
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:31,650
Is it literally the size
of your paycheck?

843
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:32,700
Does it have to be that?

844
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,276
Yeah?

845
00:35:34,276 --> 00:35:34,680
AUDIENCE: Do you think it might
be what kind of job

846
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,235
you're doing?

847
00:35:35,235 --> 00:35:36,160
PROFESSOR: It might
be the kind of job

848
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,380
you're doing, on average.

849
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,910
And we know there's phenomenally
important jobs

850
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:41,500
that are underpaid
in this country.

851
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,020
We know that.

852
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,030
But there's a lot of jobs that
are kind of fun to have, that

853
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,610
are decently paid.

854
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:50,650
Doctors, lawyers, scientists,
a lot of people find those

855
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:53,290
jobs to be pretty fulfilling
and pretty decently paid.

856
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:55,110
And there's other
ones as well.

857
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:58,010
All kinds of jobs are decently
paid, that can be fulfilling.

858
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:01,570
So it's not necessarily that
it's just about literally

859
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:04,560
three more dollars and you're
three more dollars happy.

860
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,530
So these correlations
are very tricky.

861
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:10,040
But again, the sense that moment
to moment tops out at

862
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,760
somewhere here, well
above poverty.

863
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,610
But then, big picture keeps
going up somewhere.

864
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:19,620
So think for a moment if you
can, just for a moment think

865
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:24,230
about yourselves five or
10 years from now.

866
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:26,070
And when you think, if you
can, just for one moment

867
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,790
specifically imagine in your
mind what you might be doing

868
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:31,840
five or 10 years from now.

869
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,260
And put your hand up
if you thought of

870
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:36,210
something pretty positive.

871
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:38,600
A hope.

872
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,170
Put your hand up now
if you thought of

873
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:42,290
something kind of negative.

874
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:43,808
Some of you, oh boy.

875
00:36:43,808 --> 00:36:47,160

876
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,960
Most people, our roots claim,
they think about positive

877
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,600
things in the future, other
than fumbling or failing.

878
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,890
So how good are people
at predicting what

879
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:57,850
will make them happy?

880
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,130
How good are people
at predicting

881
00:36:59,130 --> 00:36:59,790
will make them happy?

882
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,830
What people call affective
forecasting.

883
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,400
So I'll give you two examples.

884
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,170
One that's closer to
my life and one

885
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:07,850
might apply to everybody.

886
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,430
Actually, I'll tell you
a word about this.

887
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:12,090
This is a funny story.

888
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:14,650
If I don't get tenure,
I will be sad.

889
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:15,930
If I get tenure, I
will be happy.

890
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:17,390
So you know what tenure
basically is.

891
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:19,400
You're given a position, a
faculty position, for a

892
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,010
lifetime, unless you do
something really horrible.

893
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:26,390
So you can't be fired no matter
what you do almost.

894
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:28,600
You get a lot of freedom
from that.

895
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,380
So on the other hand, what
happens if you don't get

896
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,990
tenure somewhere?

897
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:33,630
Do you know what happens?

898
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,230
It's not so pleasant,
I could tell you.

899
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,610
It's not the end of
the world at all.

900
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:39,310
But let me just tell you
what know going in.

901
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:42,410
What you know going in is your
colleagues are going to meet,

902
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:43,640
they're going vote.

903
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,730
They're going to say no.

904
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:45,290
Which kind of hurts because
you've been

905
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:48,720
there five or six years.

906
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,860
And then you have
to leave town.

907
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,840
OK, you don't have
to leave town.

908
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,430
There could be another
university nearby.

909
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,290
But usually because we're so
super specialized in our

910
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:58,480
fields, you have to leave town
and go somewhere else.

911
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,180
And you have to tell your
parents, I didn't get tenure.

912
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,610
And you have to tell your
friends, I didn't get tenure.

913
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:03,445
And all your friends who you
know from work, will go, oh,

914
00:38:03,445 --> 00:38:04,330
I'm sorry you didn't
get tenure.

915
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:06,750
For a year, everybody you meet
with goes, I'm sorry you

916
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:07,780
didn't get tenure.

917
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:10,390
So you just don't want that.

918
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:13,140
Well, it's a moment I mean.

919
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,140
None of us want it.

920
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:17,570
So everybody says, I'd rather
get tenure than not.

921
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:20,280
Would you rather win the
lottery, than not?

922
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,450
Sure

923
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:24,710
Happiness researchers
love these things.

924
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:28,030
So it turns out for a couple of
years after you don't get

925
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:30,600
tenure, and all the negativity,
and leaving town,

926
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,430
and getting another job, and by
the way, some people have

927
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:36,260
not gotten tenure and become
amazing superstars, so the

928
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,540
tenure process is often
incorrect in its evaluation.

929
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,460
But two years later,
no difference in

930
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,720
happiness at all.

931
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,780
It doesn't really matter
in the long run.

932
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,160
Winning the lottery, a
year or two later,

933
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,550
no difference either.

934
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,490
There's a whole research field
that runs out the minute

935
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,600
somebody wins a big lottery.

936
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:57,460
And I had a bit of experience
on this, [INAUDIBLE]

937
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:01,470
somebody working in my brother's
house won the single

938
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:06,910
largest lottery, at that time,
prize ever, for an individual

939
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:07,900
lottery winner in the
United States.

940
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,230
It's been exceeded since.

941
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:11,090
It was something like
$187 million.

942
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:13,010
And she was definitely
pretty happy.

943
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:16,390

944
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:21,690
And she's been I have to say
remarkably wise since then, in

945
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:25,040
how she's used the money.

946
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,240
And been a very stable
person, kind of.

947
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,870
But there's equal number of
stories of people who get into

948
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,120
huge trouble.

949
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,320

950
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,610
Actually, the most amazing
story, it's sort of silly to

951
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:39,330
share, but I have a relatively
short lecture.

952
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:40,650
This was in the news.

953
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:42,630
Because you know with the
lottery they say, whoever wins

954
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,390
this will win the
single largest--

955
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:46,010
there's a huge number
of tickets sold.

956
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:50,310
And some guy, a taxi driver at
the airport, because all the

957
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:52,270
news outlets wanted
to cover this.

958
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,010
And they were trying.

959
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:53,690
Who won?

960
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:53,832
Who won?

961
00:39:53,832 --> 00:39:54,260
Who won?

962
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,540
They knew that there
was a winner.

963
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,290
They didn't know who it was.

964
00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:00,490
And a taxi driver at the airport
supposedly said, I won

965
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:00,900
the lottery.

966
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,560
I won the lottery.

967
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,380
Now, we knew he didn't, because
we knew this person

968
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,510
had won it.

969
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,810
But all the news channels were
running after this person,

970
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:10,490
because other cabdrivers
thought he said that.

971
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:13,560
And then apparently, all the
people he owed money were

972
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,410
hunting him down.

973
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:19,420
And he had to hire a lawyer to
sort of fight off people.

974
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,370
And so he was really
miserable.

975
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:25,190
And it was really sad, weird
thing to be the lottery winner

976
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,480
who didn't get the lottery, but
everybody thought you did.

977
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,400
And there's other stories in
towns, these are amazing

978
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,960
stories if you follow it, where
they know somebody won

979
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,820
the lottery in the town.

980
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,850
But the person doesn't
have to come forward.

981
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,810
And then you get all this weird
stuff, because other

982
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:39,470
people start to guess who really
has a ton of money

983
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:40,590
amongst them.

984
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:41,920
And they have wrong guesses.

985
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,100
And they go and say like, my
mother needs medical surgery.

986
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:44,670
Won't you help me?

987
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:47,200
And the person doesn't have the
money or maybe that one

988
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,340
does, but most don't.

989
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,340
There's only one.

990
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:52,760
And so the whole town gets into
huge fights and misery

991
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,900
because they are assuming that
somebody could do amazing

992
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,510
things for everybody, but
they're just being mean

993
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,780
in not doing it.

994
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,830
And 90% of their guesses of
who that is are wrong.

995
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:01,890
More than you want to know
about lotteries.

996
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:04,010
But I can tell you that on
average, a year or two later,

997
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:04,660
no difference.

998
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,660
So it's amazing.

999
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,290
You would think that
would make my life,

1000
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:08,600
if I won the lottery.

1001
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,970
And probably it does in
terms of plasma TVs.

1002
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:15,650
But in terms of self-rated
happiness, no difference.

1003
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:18,500
And here's a more amazing thing
in certain way, although

1004
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,450
if you talk to patients,
not as amazing.

1005
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:24,850
If you have a unexpected
accident leading to

1006
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:28,840
quadriplegia or paraplegia, so
you really can't get around,

1007
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:32,870
return to typical ratings of
happiness in three months.

1008
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:37,380
So we're incredibly unable to
predict, because we would have

1009
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:40,540
all kinds of ideas about how
long these would brutalize our

1010
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,870
sense of happiness.

1011
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:43,680
And we're wrong, wrong, wrong.

1012
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,950
We don't know how to predict
what will make us happy.

1013
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:51,180

1014
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,660
And some people call
this hedonic

1015
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,470
adaptation or a set point.

1016
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,980
That you go back to your
set point over

1017
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,880
an incredible range.

1018
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,640
You do respond.

1019
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,180
But you go back to it
over an incredible

1020
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,850
range of life outcomes.

1021
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:03,950
So there's a small experiment
compared to these things, but

1022
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:05,970
a controlled experiment.

1023
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:08,220
Dan Gilbert at Harvard, who's
done amazing work in this

1024
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:11,100
area, he had Harvard students in
a photography class choose

1025
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:14,350
their two favorite pictures
from the entire class.

1026
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:16,860
And they were told they have to
give one to their teacher

1027
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,510
and they can keep one.

1028
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:19,560
And there were two conditions.

1029
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,950
In one condition, once they
gave that picture to their

1030
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,900
teacher, that was it.

1031
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,490
In the other condition,
they could change the

1032
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,490
picture in a few days.

1033
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:31,750
Now, you know in all this
course, every time you think

1034
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:34,560
A, go opposite B, right?

1035
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,770
But if you weren't an amazingly
sophisticated

1036
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:40,650
psychologist at this point, if
you were just a person on the

1037
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:43,660
street, which do you think would
sound better, having no

1038
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,580
choice or having the possibility
of exchanging the

1039
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,460
picture, if you want to,
in a couple of days?

1040
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,110
It's a choice.

1041
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,850
We like choice, right?

1042
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:50,240
No.

1043
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,315
The people who are happier are
the people who say once hand

1044
00:42:53,315 --> 00:42:54,950
me the picture, that's to me.

1045
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,220
These people are standing around
going, I don't know.

1046
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:56,630
I don't know.

1047
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:57,450
Where am I going to
be happier, this

1048
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:58,310
picture or that picture?

1049
00:42:58,310 --> 00:42:58,600
I don't know.

1050
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:58,645
I don't know.

1051
00:42:58,645 --> 00:43:00,110
I can't tell.

1052
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:03,730
Also once it's an irrevocable
choice, what amazing human

1053
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:05,580
thing comes into play
that helps us feel

1054
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,600
good about our lives?

1055
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,610
Cognitive dissonance.

1056
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:11,220
Did I pick the right picture?

1057
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,580
That teachers is a sucker.

1058
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:13,940
I thought they were
the two best.

1059
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:17,050
But the one that teacher took,
oh, that was pretty bad.

1060
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:20,850
I can't believe how lucky I am
that irrevocably I ended up

1061
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:22,180
with this picture.

1062
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:25,590
The person who has days to do
this, they can't let cognitive

1063
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:28,390
dissonance come in and
fix up their choice.

1064
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:31,006

1065
00:43:31,006 --> 00:43:34,470
The paradox of choice, why
choices can be painful.

1066
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:35,480
So again, we like choice.

1067
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,860
I like choice.

1068
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,120
There's an experiment.

1069
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:42,170
People say, you go into a
typical big grocery store, 285

1070
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:45,390
cookie choices, 13 sports
drinks, 75 ice teas, 200

1071
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:47,160
channels and more, on cable.

1072
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,030

1073
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:52,850
So they did an experiment in
Palo Alto, Stanford's group,

1074
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:54,120
in a gourmet food store.

1075
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,900
They had exotic, high-quality
jams.

1076
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,420
And you could taste some jams.

1077
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:00,620
And then get a coupon for $1
off if you buy the jam.

1078
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,530
So a typical kind of
thing you might see

1079
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:04,500
sometimes in grocery stores.

1080
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:10,030
And they would have you taste
either six jams or up to 24.

1081
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:12,490
Now, most people didn't
do 24 jams.

1082
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:14,850
Because you wouldn't want to
have that many, even single

1083
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:15,680
tastes of a jam.

1084
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,200
But you'll try a few, at
a table like this.

1085
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,420
So first of all, here's
the two tables.

1086
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:22,580
Six jams or 24.

1087
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,540
More shoppers came to
the table of 24.

1088
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:25,985
Well, you see 24
jams out there.

1089
00:44:25,985 --> 00:44:27,370
It's kind of impressive.

1090
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:28,950
Like there's got be something
I like there.

1091
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:29,770
What's going on?

1092
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:33,300
So more people are drawn to
the big choice department.

1093
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,590
Now when they get there, they
only have about five jams.

1094
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:36,680
These people have about six.

1095
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,260
So it's about the same number
of jams that you taste.

1096
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,500
Big display, lots of choice.

1097
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,880
Limited choice.

1098
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,130
What happens in your
actual behavior?

1099
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:48,020
Well, at the six-jam table,
30% of the people

1100
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:50,290
purchased the jam.

1101
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:54,280
If there's a 24-jam table, only
3% made the purchases.

1102
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,760
So what do you think happened?

1103
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,650
We don't know for sure.

1104
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:57,790
This is the actual behavior.

1105
00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:02,860
Exactly the opposite, more
choices among jams led to less

1106
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:04,860
purchases of jams.

1107
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,270
What's your guess as
to what happened?

1108
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:07,074
Yeah?

1109
00:45:07,074 --> 00:45:08,702
AUDIENCE: They people who liked
[INAUDIBLE] with 24

1110
00:45:08,702 --> 00:45:09,740
jams, were in a jam.

1111
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:10,320
PROFESSOR: Were what?

1112
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,510
AUDIENCE: They're in a jam.

1113
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:12,320
PROFESSOR: They're in a jam.

1114
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:12,790
That's pretty good.

1115
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:13,490
They were in a jam.

1116
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:13,820
Yes.

1117
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:16,070
And because what?

1118
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:18,010
Because I tried five or six,
it's all I could try.

1119
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:19,560
But there's another
20 out there.

1120
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,690
And they could be awesome
beyond belief.

1121
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:23,950
And I'm not going to commit.

1122
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:26,250
Because there could be some
awesome jam around the corner.

1123
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,820
And I've only tried
five or six.

1124
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:29,420
So they're overwhelmed.

1125
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:31,270
Instead of happily getting
a jam, they're

1126
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,410
jammed up as you said.

1127
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:33,350
Ah, ah.

1128
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:35,790
And they go, um, who can begin
to figure out what's the right

1129
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:36,430
jam for me.

1130
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:38,320
It's just a way too big.

1131
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,160
So all those choices make them
less likely to make a

1132
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,140
purchase than this.

1133
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,210
Exactly the opposite of what
might intuitively-- too many

1134
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:45,460
choices are burdensome.

1135
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:49,280

1136
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,180
Calling plans.

1137
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,920
I don't know if you've ever
tried to compare calling plans

1138
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,170
across phone services.

1139
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:57,210
You sit down for a few moments
and you just give up.

1140
00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:59,960
Maybe you don't.

1141
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,870
Health insurance things,
retirement plans.

1142
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:03,520
You just get all these
complicated menus.

1143
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,890
And a lot of people
just give up.

1144
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:06,870
And they just go like,
what's the cheapest?

1145
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:08,910
What do most people do?

1146
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:12,470
Because it's just too
hard to figure out.

1147
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:17,340
So when they do surveys of
asking people what people

1148
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,440
think will make them
happy, these are

1149
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,340
the most common answers.

1150
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:24,230
If I get into a relationship
or a marriage that I like.

1151
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:25,750
If I have more flexibility
at work.

1152
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:27,810
Getting a baby, if that's
what you want.

1153
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:30,140
Losing weight, cure of a chronic
disease, making more

1154
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:32,890
money, having more time,
advancing in beauty.

1155
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:34,170
OK, this is the list.

1156
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:37,190

1157
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:38,820
It's not surprising
list, right?

1158
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:41,910
What would make you
more happy?

1159
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:45,800
And again, we know that
happiness set

1160
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,130
points are about 50%.

1161
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:51,260
10% estimated the circumstances,
like poverty.

1162
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:52,550
Things that you can't
help in your life.

1163
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:53,670
Just can't help.

1164
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:56,870
But happiness researchers are
trying to make the case that

1165
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:59,760
about 40% of our happiness
depends on what

1166
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,450
we choose to do.

1167
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:03,120
So that's a big piece.

1168
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,640
It's a big piece.

1169
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,050
We can't help some things, in
our genes or in our global

1170
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:09,600
environment.

1171
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,240
But it's almost half.

1172
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,070
And these are estimates.

1173
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:12,880
Maybe it's more.

1174
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,400
But this is the current
estimate.

1175
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:19,340
And research, over and over
again, shows that it's wrong

1176
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:21,850
to think that happiness
is found.

1177
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:22,510
Like you get there.

1178
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:24,820
And here I am, happy.

1179
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,190
That it's changing in
your circumstances.

1180
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:27,170
I move in a city.

1181
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:28,140
I get a promotion.

1182
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,140
I meet another person.

1183
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,690
That's the happiness.

1184
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:32,730
And that you either have
it or you don't.

1185
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:34,640
I'm just a person
who's not happy.

1186
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:39,090
All these things, the objective
evidence is against.

1187
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:43,540
And here's what researchers find
goes with, in experiments

1188
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,010
and in correlations.

1189
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:48,240
Here's their list, from an
objective evidence as they can

1190
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,040
get, in this kind of work.

1191
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,230
Time nurturing relations with
family and friends comes out

1192
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:55,980
as the number one thing
that plays out.

1193
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:58,950
Expressing gratitude
and helping others.

1194
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:01,470
Whole experiments were if you
just did something nice,

1195
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:02,835
people feel awesome.

1196
00:48:02,835 --> 00:48:06,050
I heard a Berkeley psychologist
say, just try to

1197
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:08,910
feel unhappy after you
just expressed

1198
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:10,770
gratitude or helped somebody.

1199
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:12,650
And you can't even do it.

1200
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:14,260
I don't know if that's
quite true.

1201
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,680
But experiments have shown
that when you have people

1202
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,090
express gratitude or do
something to help others,

1203
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:21,760
their happiness ratings
will zoom right up.

1204
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,550
Practicing optimism about the
future, savoring life in the

1205
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:28,360
present, physical exercise,
commitment to lifelong goals

1206
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,160
and ambitions.

1207
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:32,900
A sense that you have a path
that make sense to you, as

1208
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:35,620
opposed to sort of bumping
around from opportunity and

1209
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:36,770
opportunity.

1210
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:40,420
And something about, having
an approach to coping or

1211
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:43,800
resilience when bad
things happen.

1212
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,990
I'm sure in some of your lives,
heartbreaking, bad

1213
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:47,490
things have happened.

1214
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:49,440
Most of us get some of them.

1215
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,420
Many of us get every day things
that we struggle with.

1216
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:57,520
And the path by which we deal
with adversity, huge influence

1217
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,770
on self-reported happiness.

1218
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:05,380
So again, so this is
my final slide.

1219
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:09,930
And I hope that this course,
you guys have made me happy

1220
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:10,580
throughout this course.

1221
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:13,240
I've have incredibly pleasurable
lunches and

1222
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:18,090
dinners and brunches with
students from the course.

1223
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:19,890
This is just stunning for me.

1224
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:22,420
And it's really moving.

1225
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:25,560
And I'm just very grateful
to have had the chance to

1226
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,370
introduce you to these ideas.

1227
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:29,120
Have a OK exam period.

1228
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,480
You have to get through that.

1229
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,630
Bounce back and cope.

1230
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:32,090
And have a great summer.

1231
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:33,340
Thanks very much.

1232
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:50,358
