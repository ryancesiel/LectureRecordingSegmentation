00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:35,140

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,740
PROFESSOR: So last time, we
talked about spectacular

10
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,790
things about human nature
in terms of problems or

11
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,990
difficulties when we overly
obey, when we're overly

12
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,620
conformist, and the tendency
for us to do that much more

13
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,220
than we imagine we would.

14
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,630
And the experimental
evidence is pretty

15
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,290
powerful, that is true.

16
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,430
You could call that the dark
side of things like obedience

17
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,810
a and conformity.

18
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,750
The upside of it is that's how
we work together and get along

19
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,110
as a society.

20
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:03,160
And today, I'm going to focus
more on individual, everyday

21
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,840
experiences.

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,940
But again, I think you'll see
in terms of self-concept and

23
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,540
impressions of others,
those are more

24
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,890
everyday kinds of things.

25
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,990
But you'll see how they populate
our lives, how we

26
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,900
think about ourselves, how we
think about people in everyday

27
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,970
interactions, impressions
of others.

28
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,760
We've talked a little bit,
just a little bit, about

29
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,550
cultural differences.

30
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:27,610
Our course has been very focused
on American, European

31
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:28,250
type cultures.

32
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,590
We talked a little about
different ones.

33
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,110
I'll say a bit more
about that.

34
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,790
And then, I'll talk about maybe
the most thought about

35
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:38,270
disorder of social interaction,
autism.

36
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:43,120
So enhancing our views
of ourselves, OK?

37
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,440
So most US college students rank
themselves as better than

38
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,050
average students.

39
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,960
So you can sit there in your
chair and you could go, no,

40
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,970
I'm a pretty modest person.

41
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,120
But really, I'm probably
better than the average

42
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,040
student, right?

43
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,160
And by the way, I'll tell you
faculty are the same.

44
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,950
So a million high school
students rated their

45
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,990
leadership ability
in one example.

46
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,640
28% said they were average.

47
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,580
70% rated themselves as above
average in leadership.

48
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,700
You understand that only 50%
could be at most above

49
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,210
average, or 49%.

50
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:17,660
Only 2% said they were
below average.

51
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,260
60% of the high school students
of these million said

52
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,370
were in the top 10% in
their ability to

53
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,620
get along with others.

54
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,810

55
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,580
And by the way, just in case
you think it's picking on

56
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,200
students, 94% of college
instructors rated themselves

57
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,370
as better than average
teachers.

58
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:37,640
So whether you're sitting there
or standing here, we all

59
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,730
polish our image to ourselves.

60
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,640
And we can decide, is
that a bad thing?

61
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,930
Is that vanity or egoism?

62
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,040
Or is that maybe a pretty
healthy way to

63
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,220
bump through life?

64
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,950
Is overrating yourself, short
of putting yourself in

65
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,430
destructive situations, is that
a way to be happy and

66
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:54,830
optimistic?

67
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,830
Are we resilient?

68
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,700
So people call this
self-serving

69
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,140
attributional biases.

70
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,540
And this will play out
a little bit like the

71
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,970
fundamental attribution error.

72
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,190
Let me remind you
of what that is.

73
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,930
The fundamental attribution
error is when other people do

74
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:12,130
things, it's their character,
and especially failings are

75
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,240
because of failings of
their character.

76
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,570
When we do things we're not
especially proud of or don't

77
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,670
think are awesome, that's the
situation that made us do it.

78
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:23,190
And we don't provide that same
understanding of the situation

79
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,030
to understand the behaviors
of others.

80
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,410
It's not intuitive to do so.

81
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:31,650
So they did experiments where
the experimenter set up how

82
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,950
well you would do on tests.

83
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,625
They made a test super difficult
or easier, sensory

84
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:38,110
or perceptual discrimination,
social sensitivity,

85
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,080
competitive games.

86
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,910
It's all set up by
the experimenter.

87
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,820
They can make tests brutally
hard or pretty easy.

88
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,800
They can make you do well
or make you do badly.

89
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,860
And when people did well and
they were asked to say why

90
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,180
they thought they did well,
the usual description was,

91
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,570
because I'm a particularly
social person.

92
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,110
I'm very competitive.

93
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,890
I'm extra good at sensory
perception.

94
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,340
You pick it.

95
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,210
When they did badly, that
was a tough test.

96
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,070
It's rare for people to say,
that was an easy test!

97
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,940
Who wouldn't do well?

98
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,970
If you do well, people tend to
ascribe it to their character,

99
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,900
and when they do badly,
the situation.

100
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,150
even within ourselves.

101
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,910

102
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,450
And it extends to families,
social and political groups,

103
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,300
and sports teams.

104
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,080
You may know I'm very proud and
happy to be a member of

105
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,920
the MIT community.

106
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,800
Something happens bad
at MIT, I don't go,

107
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,340
well, then, MIT stinks.

108
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,250
I go, oh, there was a situation
that wasn't

109
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,740
well-handled by an individual.

110
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,180
Same thing you might
think about the

111
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,570
country you belong to.

112
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,290
We don't say, US did
something bad.

113
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,040
Most of us don't go, well,
the US stinks.

114
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,200
We go, that's situation
wasn't very good.

115
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,600
We've got to change things.

116
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:44,950
Yeah?

117
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,926
AUDIENCE: Do you think this is
saying more about how people

118
00:04:47,926 --> 00:04:49,744
explain things to others
or about what

119
00:04:49,744 --> 00:04:51,894
they actually believe?

120
00:04:51,894 --> 00:04:53,810
PROFESSOR: So the question was,
is it what they actually

121
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:54,940
believe, or say to others?

122
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,640
I think the evidence is it's
about what they say to

123
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,640
themselves truly about how they

124
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,080
explain success or failure.

125
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,080
OK?

126
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,310
People are biased to attribute
their successes to their

127
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,150
wonderful traits and their
failures to situations.

128
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,780
But we talked earlier that that
can be a healthy thing.

129
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,040
Because then, you
can bounce back.

130
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,840
You can say, well,
I did badly.

131
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,190
But, hey, I'm a winner.

132
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,490
And tomorrow morning,
I'll get up.

133
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,200
And I'm back at bat, right?

134
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,490
Instead of saying,
oh, I'm a loser.

135
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,080
It's all just pointless.

136
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,330
So in what sense is it
good to have this?

137
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,410
It's not a good thing
or a bad thing.

138
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,670
It's probably a thing of
positive mental health but it

139
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:36,790
can make us overlook
causes of things.

140
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:41,030
So an example of that as we
construct social realities,

141
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,730
and you may know this is
the original study.

142
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,650
But there's a million since.

143
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,650
An undefeated Princeton
team played Dartmouth

144
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,780
in a football game.

145
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,110
Princeton won.

146
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,390
And then, they looked
at the newspaper

147
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,330
accounts of the games--

148
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,110
totally different.

149
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,760
They showed the film
to students

150
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,030
from the two campuses.

151
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,760
And depending on which team
you were rooting for, you

152
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,500
tended to view the other team
as dirty, not playing fair,

153
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,580
not doing the right thing.

154
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,680
You don't have to be much of a
sports fan to notice things

155
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,890
where the other team is not
doing the right thing and your

156
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,440
team, when it doesn't do the
right thing, well, they were

157
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,260
under pressure.

158
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,510
It was atypical.

159
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,130

160
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,430
And that makes it, of
course, hard for

161
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,220
people to get together.

162
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,160
We don't too much worry about
Princeton/Dartmouth

163
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,710
tension in the world.

164
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:26,110
But we do worry about tensions
in the Middle East between

165
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,760
Palestinians and Israelis.

166
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,940
When they see the same news
story, how do they interpret

167
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,200
what happened in that
news story?

168
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,900

169
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,700
So this question of if we have
illusions that we're better

170
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,910
than we are a little bit, is
that a bad thing or is that a

171
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:45,060
good thing was tested in an
ironic study by Alloy and

172
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,490
Abramson looking at patients
with actual clinical

173
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,730
depression.

174
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:51,050
So they gave depressed and
non-depressed students tasks

175
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:54,410
that varied in the degree of
contingency, that is how much

176
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,820
the performance of the
participant actually

177
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,790
influenced the outcome.

178
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,630
They controlled that.

179
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,500
And then, they asked people
afterwards to estimate the

180
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,090
degree of contingency between
a button press and a green

181
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,190
light going on.

182
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,650
How much of it was you, and how
much of it seemed to be

183
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:11,670
randomly done by the
experimenter?

184
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,240
Depressed students in this
particular setting were more

185
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,220
accurate in knowing when it
would depend on them.

186
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,900
And non-depressed students
overestimated the contingency.

187
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,890
They overestimated their
influence on the situation

188
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,940
when the outcomes
were desired.

189
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,430
Awesome, that's because
I'm awesome.

190
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,800
And when things didn't go so
well, again, not really under

191
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,300
their control.

192
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,340
But they don't know that.

193
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,290
It's the situation.

194
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,880
Something was screwed up
with the experiment.

195
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,200
So they're more variable--

196
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,030
they interpret the situation
much more,

197
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:40,950
again, on these things.

198
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,040
And you could say they're
less accurate.

199
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,450
But you could also say that's
a way, again, to have

200
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,970
confidence in yourself and
optimism about the future.

201
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:51,390

202
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,020
Another way in which we believe
and justify our

203
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,030
choices but a way in which we're
socially influenced is

204
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,290
this, the phenomenon called
false consensus.

205
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:01,410
People choose to engage in a
behavior that those people who

206
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,140
do that believe that it's more
common and that more people do

207
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:09,760
that, that when you do
something, the more you do it,

208
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,950
the more you think other
people do it, too.

209
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,250
What's the big deal?

210
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,650
You might know that feeling.

211
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,500
So the original experiment on
the Stanford campus for this

212
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,220
phenomenon from Lee Ross was he
asked people carry around a

213
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,350
sign on campus that said "Eat
at Joe's" for 30 minutes.

214
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,140
Some people said
no, thank you.

215
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:29,040
Some people said yes because
they were obedient.

216
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,670
Compliance.

217
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,539
Now, of the people who said yes,
I'll carry that sign for

218
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:35,559
30 minutes, they thought the
majority of other people when

219
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:39,409
asked to do so will do so.

220
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:41,210
They thought, well, that's
the way most people are.

221
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,730
And I'm going to behave
like most people.

222
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,350
That's a false consensus.

223
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:47,540
The people who said no, I won't
do it, they thought the

224
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,280
majority would not do it.

225
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,450
So part of their thinking about
deciding if they'll do

226
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,640
something or not is their
estimate of whether people in

227
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,250
general would do it.

228
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,380
But what you can see happens
is that driven by whether

229
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,140
they're going to do it or not.

230
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,830
So for example, teenage smokers
estimate higher rates

231
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:08,620
of smoking than nonsmokers.

232
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,200
Domestically abusive men
estimate that about 28% of men

233
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,300
have violently thrown things
at their partner.

234
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,460
Best estimates are
it's down to 12%.

235
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,690
So we tend to overly believe
that other people will do the

236
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,560
same behaviors that we do.

237
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,155
And that's part of justifying
those behaviors.

238
00:09:23,155 --> 00:09:26,160

239
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,630
A demonstration of that was from
Phil Zimbardo, the social

240
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,180
psychologist who did the
prison experiment.

241
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,020
This has some of the same
flavor, not quite as dramatic.

242
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,500
But he worked in New York before
he moved to Stanford.

243
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,920
So he compared the Bronx
to Palo Alto.

244
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,840
In 1980, the paper
was published.

245
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,050
And he left out cars, one in
upper middle class Palo Alto--

246
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:49,380
very suburban area if you
haven't been there-- and one

247
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,180
in a tough Bronx area.

248
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,080
As you could imagine, you
leave a car out there by

249
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,520
itself in the Bronx area without
a license plate and

250
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,610
the hood was up, it was
stripped within a day.

251
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,130
So you park the car, you push
up the hood, no license

252
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,160
plate-- stripped within a day.

253
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,000
In Palo Alto, it's untouched
for a week.

254
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,530
So that's obviously to do with
the environment you're in.

255
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,100
But here's the false
consensus.

256
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,550
So then, they smash a window.

257
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,170
And within an hour,
it's stripped.

258
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,310
As soon as you smash the
window-- we talked about

259
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,000
broken windows.

260
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,950
Here it is literally.

261
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,480
Soon as somebody says,
all rules are off.

262
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,790
This car is smash, wrecked--

263
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,370
that's the behavior
I can engage in.

264
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,800

265
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,990
What you perceive as the
relevance, the environment of

266
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:36,150
behaviors are appropriate,
hugely influences and

267
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,510
justifies and drives
your own behavior.

268
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,910

269
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:45,660
Now one of the tasks people have
to try to convince people

270
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,090
to do public goods
in various ways--

271
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:51,380
and this is an ad that when I
was younger was very famous.

272
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,800
For you, it's so long ago
in history that you may

273
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,530
not even know it.

274
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,930
But it was one of the most
famous ones when the United

275
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,670
states was first confronting
issues with environmental

276
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,420
problems and pollution.

277
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,140
You may not believe this, but
there was an era when there

278
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,670
was fantastic pollution in the
air and the water and the land

279
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,820
and nobody seemed to care about
it at all because land

280
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,430
seemed endless.

281
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,460
It wasn't even a thought.

282
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,160
So Earth Day was
from the 1970s.

283
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,920
That was the marking of a wider
consciousness of the

284
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,970
consequence of ruining
the environment.

285
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,270
And so in the very earliest
stages, when people weren't

286
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:27,040
used almost any discussions of
that, there was this ad with a

287
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,770
Native American with a tear
running down his face.

288
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,020
And let me show you the ad.

289
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:39,020

290
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:44,630
A very powerful ad at a time,
and one that I'll show you in

291
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,890
a minute that social
psychologists believe was

292
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,720
completely counterproductive
to the goal of reducing

293
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,840
pollution--

294
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,200
exactly the thing you don't
want to do because we just

295
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,650
talked about false consensus and
about these environmental

296
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,800
justifications.

297
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,960
So I'll tell you, but
what does that mean?

298
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,960
So if you see a lot of people
throwing garbage onto the

299
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,710
beach, onto the street, into
the river, what are you

300
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,150
allowed to do?

301
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,900
Pollute yourself.

302
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,490
Hey, everybody else
is doing it.

303
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,590
What's the big deal?

304
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,430
That's the mode of
behavior, right?

305
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,880
Broken window, steal the car.

306
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,200
Litter everywhere, OK,
somebody is saying

307
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,880
it's not a good idea.

308
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,540
But the behavior that I see is

309
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,070
littering, littering, littering.

310
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,500
It's OK to litter.

311
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,550
So they literally showed
this in experiments.

312
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,690
They took people into
areas, into parks.

313
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:33,320
They surrounded them with
different amounts of trash.

314
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,610
Here's the percentage of
people who litter.

315
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,120
Here's how much trash
was around them.

316
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,000
They went into parks and they
put a little trash and they

317
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,140
watched somebody come by.

318
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,620
Still, some people
are littering.

319
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,640
Maybe less would now.

320
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,370
I don't know.

321
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:47,430
But as soon as there was four
pieces or eight pieces of

322
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:50,700
littering, then you more than
double the littering when

323
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,330
there's zero.

324
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:57,800
So the very example of showing
littering drives littering.

325
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,890
You say, nobody's saying
it's a good thing.

326
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:02,060
But hey, it's what everybody's
doing.

327
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:02,810
And why do we litter?

328
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:06,370
Because we're lazy and most of
us just don't want to bother

329
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,300
to walk to the garbage can.

330
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,730
So they did an experiment with
public service announcements

331
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,310
where they said the important
thing is to see behavior, the

332
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,230
behavior you want.

333
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,080
Like in this case, it was
a recycling thing.

334
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:25,460
And then, you show one example
of a person who doesn't do it.

335
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,550
And you say, bad person!

336
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,240
You don't say bad person, but
you send that message.

337
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,700
You say, here's the
behavior we want.

338
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,640
There's somebody doing that.

339
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,890
Uh-uh.

340
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:36,000
And what they found
is that 25%--

341
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,260
this is truly in
the community--

342
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,180
increase in recycling.

343
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,270
So if you want to get people to
do things, showing them bad

344
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:46,510
behavior unfortunately makes
them think that bad behavior

345
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:49,440
is widespread and an acceptable
way to go.

346
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,960
So you have to show them good
behavior and then give maybe

347
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,030
one example of bad things
because you don't want to be

348
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,040
labeled bad.

349
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,860
But mostly, they have to see the
behavior you want, not the

350
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,340
behavior you're trying
to discourage.

351
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,970
So for a social psychologist,
exactly the opposite outcome

352
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,850
of the intended ad.

353
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:12,130
So this speaks to a gap
almost all of us have.

354
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,980
Some of you may be more perfect
than I. Many of you

355
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,080
may be more perfect than I.
But here's the gap we face

356
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,140
every morning when we get up,
which is the difference

357
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,920
between our attitudes
and our actions--

358
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,120
the things we know are the way
we wish we were, the right

359
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,580
thing to do, and the way in
which sometimes we don't

360
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,760
always do the rightest thing
we know we could.

361
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,260
So daffodil days, you may know,
occurs in many places

362
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,510
including universities where you
buy a daffodil and there's

363
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,910
a four day campus
event to benefit

364
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,320
American Cancer Society.

365
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,840
So it's a nice thing.

366
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,830
It's buying a flower.

367
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:44,450
It's a good cause, fighting
cancer, very positive.

368
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:49,040
So they did a study with
251 Cornell students.

369
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,370
And they asked them, when
daffodil day comes up and you

370
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,020
just spend a tiny bit of money--
it's a very small

371
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,150
amount of money they
ask from students--

372
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,000
will you buy at least
one flower?

373
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,190
And over 80% said,
yes, I will.

374
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,870
For a cause like that, buying
a beautiful flower to fight

375
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,530
cancer, I'll spend $1.

376
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,010
How about the other students?

377
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,510
Well, they're kind of lazy.

378
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,590
And they have good intentions.

379
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,610
But probably only about half
of them will do it.

380
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,860
That's a little bit of
the self-affirmation.

381
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,520
I'm a good person.

382
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,710
Other people will be flawed.

383
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,130
So how many people
actually buy it?

384
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,590
43%.

385
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:23,140
So what happened to this 40%?

386
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,290
Well, it's a little bit
like the story.

387
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:24,850
Things were busy.

388
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:25,990
Things were happening.

389
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:30,020
They weren't for cancer
and against flowers,

390
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,200
just they got busy.

391
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:31,840
There were exams.

392
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,380
There was stuff going on.

393
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,500

394
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,970
And how do we explain to
ourselves this gap between the

395
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:43,480
attitudes we hold
and truly hold?

396
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,220
We want to do good things and
be a good person, and the

397
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:50,470
actions we do, which are often
a little bit below that?

398
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:54,080
So this gap between our
attitudes and our actions has

399
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,840
led to the phenomenon of
cognitive dissonance.

400
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,460
You now hear this term
used widely.

401
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,800
Originally, it had a pretty
narrow meaning.

402
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,440
And I'm going to
be just talking

403
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,105
about that narrow meaning.

404
00:16:02,105 --> 00:16:04,390
It's become a term that's
used much more widely.

405
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:07,360
But here's the original
work from Festinger.

406
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,180
He said that we have a problem
all the time that we have a

407
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,820
gap between our attitudes and
our behaviors and that, as

408
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,100
humans, we have to solve this
because we don't feel good

409
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,510
about that gap.

410
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:22,980
And so here's how we approached
showing how we

411
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,220
solve that problem.

412
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,510
Of course, the nice thing would
be just to do the right

413
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,210
thing all the time.

414
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,730
But that's not within, most
of us, somehow our grasp.

415
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:30,580
OK

416
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,930
So here's what he
had people do.

417
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:35,290
He had people come in and do
a purposefully boring task.

418
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,860
So they would pack and unpack
spools in a tray.

419
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,000
Or they would turn tiny
little screws,

420
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,810
each of them a quarter.

421
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,580
It was purposefully boring.

422
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,700
You could tell it was boring,
and it was boring.

423
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,430
This was the goal.

424
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,100
And then, either nothing
would happen--

425
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,180
that's one group--

426
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,180
or you would get paid $1--

427
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,290
not much money--

428
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,740
or $20--

429
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,400
considerably better--

430
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,235
to lie and tell the next person
who's coming in that

431
00:17:00,235 --> 00:17:02,620
this was an interesting
and worthwhile task.

432
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,310
So you imagine you go in there,
you do something that's

433
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,220
really boring.

434
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,109
Imagine you're in this group.

435
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,880
They say, here, here's $1.

436
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,890
Will you lie to the
next person?

437
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:13,130
Or here's $20, will you lie to
the next person saying this

438
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,520
was a pretty cool task?

439
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,260
I can't believe how lucky you
are to have the next turn.

440
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,525
And then they say, OK, now we
know you lied to that person.

441
00:17:20,525 --> 00:17:21,960
We asked you to do it.

442
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,819
But really, really,
how was the task?

443
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:26,089
Really, really, how
was the task?

444
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:28,730
And here's the amazing
finding.

445
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,440
If you don't lie, you say I
didn't like it very much at

446
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,020
all, here's zero,
less than zero.

447
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:40,800
If you are paid $1 to lie,
whoa, it really was good!

448
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:45,210
If you're paid $20 to lie, you
pretty much agree it stinks.

449
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,670
So how does that work?

450
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,370
You have to see the irony
of this, right?

451
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:52,120
So the interpretation is this.

452
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,590
If somebody pays you $20 to make
a white lie-- you don't

453
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,240
see this as a brutal lie, just
telling the next student that

454
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,250
this is a pretty cool task--

455
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,590
is $20 worth a white lie?

456
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,780
You can live with that.

457
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,050
You know why you did it.

458
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,110
But $1?

459
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,330
Would you sacrifice your
integrity for $1?

460
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:13,980

461
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,920
You understand--

462
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,540
$1?

463
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,970
How cheap can you be?

464
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,430
So their idea is this.

465
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,910
But now they're asking them
really, really, really, really

466
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:26,220
the way that people put together
their attitudes, like

467
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,120
I lied for a mere dollar, is to
say, hey, it must have been

468
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,200
more interesting than
I first thought.

469
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,510
Come to think of it, it was
pretty interesting.

470
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:34,785
Boom.

471
00:18:34,785 --> 00:18:36,000
Do you understand that?

472
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,770
So the effort to match up the
discrepancy between your

473
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:43,000
attitudes and actions,
you solve--

474
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,390
you can't let them
go like this.

475
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,350
You can explain this.

476
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,830
I lied because I got
paid a bunch.

477
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,280
But this, you can't explain.

478
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,870
It's too hard to understand.

479
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,760
And you really create a
rationalization that puts it

480
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,390
all together.

481
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,480
And you really, really report
now that this was

482
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,730
a pretty good task.

483
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,870

484
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:00,590
Here's another one.

485
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,655
And this is not high
tech experiments.

486
00:19:03,655 --> 00:19:07,140
You can do amazing experiments
without zapping people.

487
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,930
But by the time I tell you the
end of this one experiment--

488
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,540
let's see if I have
one more on this.

489
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:16,270
Nah, I'll mention it now
and then the next one.

490
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:19,790
It pretty much ruins it whenever
anybody tells you how

491
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,270
satisfied they are with almost
anything they've

492
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,330
done in their life.

493
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,580
This has ruined it for me.

494
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,750
And I'll tell you why.

495
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,640
Although I know that
you're better off

496
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,700
polishing your happiness.

497
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,530
So here's a simple experiment.

498
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,880
This guy, Jack Brehm, had a
bunch of wedding gifts.

499
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,580
And he took his wedding
gifts to the lab.

500
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,980
It was not very high tech.

501
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,970
And he had people rate how
much they wanted them.

502
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:43,590
So he had stuff like a desk
lamp, a toaster, a stopwatch,

503
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:46,100
a radio, a bunch of stuff
you got in the

504
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,580
1950s as wedding gifts.

505
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,390
People rated how much
did they like them.

506
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,720
And then, he picked two that
were in the middle of the list

507
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,160
and rated right next
to each other.

508
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,840
And he said, will you pick
one of these two?

509
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,090
You get to take it home.

510
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:02,760

511
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,740
Will you pick one of these two
that you rated in the middle

512
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,220
right next to each other?

513
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,120
And you pick one.

514
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,730
He says, OK, do one more thing
before you take it home.

515
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:12,890
Tell me again your rating for
the different things here.

516
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:16,120
And here's what they find,
that the items that

517
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,580
you chose move up.

518
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,600
You already have it.

519
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,750
But let's say it was rated one
to 10, it was rated a five, it

520
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,680
now becomes a two.

521
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,430
Man, that stopwatch, that's
pretty awesome.

522
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,330
I thought it was a five.

523
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,040
But it's a two, maybe a one.

524
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,880
I can't believe how lucky
I am that I picked that.

525
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,410
And how about the one
you didn't pick?

526
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:39,260
Say the toaster was number
six or number four.

527
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,870
That moved to nine or 10.

528
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,180
That toaster stinks.

529
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:46,390
That would have been such a bad
choice to attend Harvard.

530
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,850
It would have been a disaster.

531
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:51,150
Thank goodness I picked MIT.

532
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,190
So the idea is even something
like this-- and everything

533
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,360
they do, college
choices, cars--

534
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,700
any experiment you do, if you
have people rate after they

535
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,230
made a decision about what
they're going to do, they

536
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:04,930
always rate the thing they
picked as awesome on average

537
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,380
and the thing they didn't pick
as much worse than they

538
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,130
initially rated it.

539
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,110
And again, you can say,
is that a way we can

540
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,460
have a happy life?

541
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,940
Would you want to be at MIT
every day going, if only I'd

542
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,480
gone to Princeton!

543
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,340
Would you want to get married
to somebody and say, if only

544
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,870
I'd waited a little
bit longer.

545
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,420
For your career, could you have
said, I went right to

546
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,150
medical school or law school
or engineering.

547
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,570
If only I waited longer!

548
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,360
So you want to say no,
thank goodness

549
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,160
I picked that college.

550
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,510
Thank goodness I picked
that career.

551
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:35,670
Thank goodness I picked that
spouse or partner because the

552
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,150
other choices that were vaguely
in my head were awful.

553
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:41,320
I don't know how I was even
thinking about them.

554
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,560
So this has ruined it for me
every time anyone tells me how

555
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,750
happy they are with a choice
they've made in their life

556
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,790
because I look at this and go,
yeah, once you make that

557
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:51,926
choice, you're going to rate it
as awesome no matter what.

558
00:21:51,926 --> 00:21:54,520
And a famous example is now many
of you are taking pretty

559
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,960
tough courses.

560
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,700
Years later when you come back
for alumni events-- and

561
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,830
hopefully many of you will have
good feelings about MIT

562
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,550
and come back and see
your classmates--

563
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:06,870
and you'll get around and say,
oh, that course was so brutal.

564
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,220
I know that won't
be this course.

565
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,410
That course was so brutal
with the problem sets.

566
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:14,960
But it made me a stronger
person, a better person.

567
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,570
Thank goodness I did it.

568
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,490
And maybe it does.

569
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:21,100
But let me tell you
why you will think

570
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,690
that in large numbers.

571
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,880
So 1959, there's a little bit
of a sociological experiment

572
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,820
in the sense you have to think
of people in 1959.

573
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,260
And they were told to qualify
for a research study, some

574
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:35,250
women were required to read
aloud a list of obscene words

575
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,930
which are seen as extremely
embarrassing and

576
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,340
inappropriate in 1959.

577
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,560
Nowadays, it might be
the preferred mode.

578
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,340
But in 1959, it was like,
I don't know.

579
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,930
This is not right--

580
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:44,930
or mild words.

581
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,650
So that's the experimenter.

582
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:49,785
Then, you got the privilege, if
you did this, to listen to

583
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:53,290
a lecture on mating habits
of lower animals.

584
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:56,910
But they made it the most
boring they could.

585
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,680
This could go a couple different
ways, mating habits

586
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,800
of lower animals.

587
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,180
They made it super boring
on purpose.

588
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,130
Lecture's over.

589
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:07,320
And they ask the students
to rate the lecture, an

590
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,870
intentionally super
boring lecture.

591
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,980
And the women were either in the
group with the unpleasant

592
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,090
experience of having to read
aloud uncomfortable word lists

593
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,940
or just neutral words,
no big deal.

594
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,680
Who rated the lecture better?

595
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:24,800
The women who read the obscene
list of words because they

596
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,630
were saying, well, why would
I do this if the

597
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,000
lecture weren't terrific?

598
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,410
So the worse the experience
where you've had some sense of

599
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:38,290
choice in it, the more people
will explain to themselves I

600
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,630
took it for an extremely
good reason.

601
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:43,030
I would not do a
painful thing.

602
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,370
I'm not that incompetent.

603
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:46,070
It must've been a
wise decision.

604
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,980
And in fact, I should tell you
that if the examiner picks

605
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,350
these items, you don't have
much of an effect.

606
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,900
So if you rate items four and
five or five and six and the

607
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,480
examiner gives you the
stopwatch, it doesn't change

608
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,530
your ratings because you
didn't choose it.

609
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:00,990
The examiner did.

610
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:03,100
The stopwatch is a
mediocre gift?

611
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,630
It's still a mediocre gift.

612
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:08,500
But if you chose it, you have
to justify the choice.

613
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,250
And there's 1,000 experiments
like this.

614
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,490
Why did I do something
so painful?

615
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:16,390
It must've been for a
very good reason.

616
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,440
And then, you figure out what
that reason was, like the

617
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,460
lecture was more awesome
than I thought.

618
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,850
That physics course, that math
course, that computer science

619
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:25,330
course just made me the
person I am today.

620
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:28,070

621
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,320
We're going to switch gears
now, first impressions.

622
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,850
So there's a book from Malcolm
Gladwell, Blink, which is

623
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,900
really driven by this
phenomenon.

624
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,590
The first impressions we take
of other people, how

625
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,500
powerful are they?

626
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,570
How valid are they?

627
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:44,520
How accurate are they?

628
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,440
So here's how we're going to
start the story, all the way

629
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,510
back in 1966.

630
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,410
They had students rate people's
personality on the

631
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:52,980
first day of class before
they met each other.

632
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,250
So if we had done this in this
course, imagine the first day

633
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:58,470
of this course, imagine you're
not sitting with a friend and

634
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:01,050
you're asked to people around
you on various personality

635
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:02,110
dimensions.

636
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:04,570
And the two that popped
out were sociable and

637
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:05,610
responsibility.

638
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:08,095
The people who said they were
sociable people tended to rate

639
00:25:08,095 --> 00:25:10,600
them as sociable just from
sitting next to them for a

640
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,740
moment or as highly
responsible.

641
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:17,490
So this is outgoingness and
personality psychology or

642
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,340
extraversion.

643
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,410
And this is something like
conscientiousness.

644
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,710
Just talk to a person for
a couple of moments.

645
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:27,600
You rate them pretty much like
they rate themselves.

646
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,080
You don't know anything about
their background.

647
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,490
You haven't had a
big interaction.

648
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:32,770
Literally, it's moments next
to each in a course.

649
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:36,680
Here's another one, 250 students
divided into groups

650
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,810
of four who didn't know each
other and had not spoken.

651
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,260
And they rated each other.

652
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,480
And there was pretty good
correlations between moments

653
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:48,230
of sitting together and how
sociable or extroverted people

654
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,970
were, how responsible,
or conscientiousness.

655
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:56,050
So a few moments with somebody
correlates pretty well your

656
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:58,580
rating, on average, with how
they know themselves from a

657
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,220
lifetime of personal
experience-- a few moments,

658
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,470
pretty well.

659
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:05,010
Now, we could say how well
do we rate ourselves?

660
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,950
You could already pretty well
because it's pretty well

661
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,410
adjusted with what other
people think.

662
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:11,550
But here's another example where
they put strangers into

663
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:17,040
groups, videotaped them, had
other people later on view the

664
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,440
video tapes and rate things
like how extroverted they

665
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,620
were, how much time did they
talk, how many arm movements.

666
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,850
The impressions of the judges
watching the videotape

667
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:28,240
correlated pretty well with
self-ratings and with ratings

668
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,000
of other people who saw them
just for a few moments

669
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,600
personally.

670
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,340
So all these things line up.

671
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,870
Just from a few moments of
experience, you get a

672
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:39,470
surprisingly strong consensus
about how outgoing somebody is

673
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:43,630
and how conscientious or
responsible they are.

674
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:45,770
And it lines up pretty much with
the person's own judgment

675
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,370
about themselves that way.

676
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:51,835
So this reached a huge moment
from Nalani Ambady who's now

677
00:26:51,835 --> 00:26:54,870
at Tufts having this famous
experiment, thin slices.

678
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,800
And it's a fantastic
experiment.

679
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,620
And if you ever teach,
it makes you nervous.

680
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,730
Then, we'll discuss whether
it should or not.

681
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:02,540
So at Harvard, here's
what she did.

682
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:06,350
She took videotapes of 13
graduate teaching assistants.

683
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,940
And they were horrible
video tapes.

684
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,840
This is 1990.

685
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,960
They were horrible videotape.

686
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,280
I'm just going to tell you--

687
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,780
you don't even see them around
very much because the quality,

688
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,830
when you see them, you can't
believe people even

689
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:18,500
saw things in them.

690
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:24,320
And she got a random 10 second
clip, 30 seconds per teaching

691
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,940
assistant, 30 seconds.

692
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,620
She shows a silent
clip to students.

693
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,605
There's no sound even.

694
00:27:29,605 --> 00:27:32,270
You're just seeing silently
some teaching assistant in

695
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:34,750
front of students saying
something.

696
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,840
And then, she has these students
rate from the silent

697
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,520
film clip how accepting,
active, competent, or

698
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,070
confident the teaching assistant
is who they've never

699
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,450
met and, of course,
they don't know.

700
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,370
And they don't know
what the teaching

701
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,240
assistant's talking about.

702
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,880
Here's the impressive thing.

703
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,410
Then, they correlate the ratings
with the actual end of

704
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,720
semester rating with students.

705
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,250
They take the students who sat
through the entire course with

706
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:00,200
a teaching assistant, that's
one set of values.

707
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,870
They take the students
who see 30 seconds of

708
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:07,030
silent, grainy videotape.

709
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:09,510
And they say, how well do these
things do together?

710
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:13,980
And they correlate 0.76,
which is really high.

711
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,410
It's really high in our
field of research.

712
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:21,480
That momentary, uninformed
impression correlates

713
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,500
extremely high with what
students rate the teaching

714
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,030
assistant after a full semester,
back and forth,

715
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:30,030
seeing the teaching assistant
day in, day out, week in, week

716
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,420
out for an entire semester and
all the interactions--

717
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,000
super high correlation.

718
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,230
And it stays if it's cut
from 30 seconds to

719
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,410
15, or even six seconds.

720
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:44,180
So this is a thin slice, a tiny
viewing of somebody, has

721
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,620
this profound effect.

722
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:50,160
So one impression you can have
from this is something like,

723
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,030
gee, we form our first
impression--

724
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:55,430
and I'll come back to that--
and once we form that first

725
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,180
impression, that's it.

726
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:00,980
The ship has sailed to
a remarkable degree.

727
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,410
We can learn new things
about people.

728
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,520
We can change our impressions.

729
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,720
It's not that we can't.

730
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,450
But to a remarkable degree,
we've set our final impression

731
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:12,970
of that person within seconds
of interaction.

732
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,610
Now, you could say, and of
course that's going to be

733
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:17,280
fraught with every kind of
social prejudice you can

734
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,010
imagine and complicating
prejudice you can imagine.

735
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:19,750
Six seconds?

736
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,210
Not a lot to sort through
intellectually.

737
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:24,210
And it shows up in real life.

738
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:26,310
For example, listen to 20
seconds of a physician

739
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,230
speaking during a routine
office visit, they tape

740
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,620
recorded them.

741
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:32,140
Above chance prediction of who
was sued for malpractice or

742
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:35,320
not because if you like a
doctor, you tend to forgive an

743
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,740
error as a human error.

744
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,210
If you don't like a doctor,
you're going to sue that

745
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,970
person because you're
pretty mad at them.

746
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,400
So do you give them
the benefit of the

747
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,600
doubt they made a mistake?

748
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,050
Or do you think they ought to
be sued and punished for the

749
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,790
bad thing they did to you?

750
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:51,690
Depends how much you like the
person to start with.

751
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,600
Now, so one thing could
be that we go by first

752
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,500
impressions.

753
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,300
What's the other possibility
you could imagine?

754
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:00,510

755
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,340
The pessimistic view
of this is--

756
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,820
and it's somewhere, I think,
really in the middle, it's

757
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,540
just human nature.

758
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:07,590
The pessimistic view
is six seconds?

759
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,650
When we talk about this, the
teaching assistants and I as

760
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:11,860
we'd be in the course go, oh,
please, have that first six

761
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,830
seconds go OK because that's
going to be 3/4 of your

762
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,700
teaching evaluations--

763
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,040
which are due Monday
by 9:00 AM.

764
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,810

765
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:22,790
So please fill those out, by
the way, this reminds me.

766
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,480
The first six seconds, and
that's pretty much it.

767
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,240
And everything we do for the
rest of the semester,

768
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,170
everything we do for the rest of
the semester, is only going

769
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:30,180
to be about a quarter
of your rating.

770
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,200
That's hard to believe, right?

771
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,490
So one thing is it's all a big
confusion and humans just--

772
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:38,310
what's the other possibility
that's a little bit more

773
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:41,900
optimistic and maybe accurate?

774
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,100
We know what we like.

775
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,620
We know what we like, OK?

776
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:49,850
And amazingly, we can tell
within seconds under many

777
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:52,240
circumstance whether there's
something about a person that

778
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,550
we like or don't.

779
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,890
It's not that the six
seconds are just

780
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:58,210
superficial in a dumb way.

781
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:01,690
It's that we detect things about
that person that truly

782
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:04,170
are something about
who they are.

783
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:06,130
And that tends to carry all
the way through our human

784
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,630
interactions with them.

785
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:13,010
So I think it's somewhere
in that range.

786
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:13,970
And does it matter?

787
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,890
Is it all just about popularity
contests?

788
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:17,140
Or does it affect
other things?

789
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,980
So just staying within the realm
of teaching, they asked

790
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:26,670
if you perceive somebody as more
likable or conscientious,

791
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,180
are they more effective
teachers?

792
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,220
Does it circle around
like that?

793
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,220
So they have five students
in random groups.

794
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,600
One was randomly chosen
to be a teacher.

795
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,630
And these teachers prepared
brief math lessons.

796
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,980
The students then
took the test.

797
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,155
And strangers rated 10 seconds
of videos of these teachers.

798
00:31:41,155 --> 00:31:42,650
So people prepared
math lessons.

799
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:45,250
Some better, some worse,
as you would imagine.

800
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:49,020
The higher these were rated in
these 10 second thin slice

801
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:52,330
videos by an external group, the
better the test scores of

802
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:55,520
the actual participants because
something about

803
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,950
effective teaching is something

804
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,320
about engaging students.

805
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,540
Something about engaging
students is something about

806
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:05,130
being outgoing or something like
that to a certain degree.

807
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,630
So it's not just arbitrary.

808
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:11,760
There's something real in
the world that happens.

809
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,390
And here's a few examples
where people have messed

810
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,140
around with that because there's
two things that happen

811
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:17,670
that are tricky.

812
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:21,310
One is we know what we like
and we detect it amazingly

813
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:24,130
quickly in people on average
to a large extent--

814
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:27,920
certainly with error, but to a
surprisingly vigorous extent.

815
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,240
On the other hand-- and we'll
come back to this--

816
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,390
once we have that first
impression, as faulty as it

817
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:37,490
may be in part, we keep
interpreting things in terms

818
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:39,550
of that first impression.

819
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:42,800
We give you the benefit of the
doubt or we don't behavior

820
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,390
after behavior.

821
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:46,530
So this was a study that
was done at MIT.

822
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:49,120
Now, you're going to get
some prior information.

823
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,290
Half the students were told,
the lecture you're about to

824
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:54,690
have, people know him and
consider him to be--

825
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:55,480
and then here's the--

826
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,690
you're in the group that's told
he's a very warm person,

827
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:59,430
industrious, critical,
practical, and determined.

828
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:03,210
Or half of you would get the
information that he's a cold

829
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:06,920
person, industrious, critical,
practical, and determined.

830
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,860
So you just got an impression,
a warm or cold person.

831
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,830
You haven't even seen
the person.

832
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:14,450
Person gets up and leads
a 20 minute discussion.

833
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,560
Then, you're asked to fill
out evaluations.

834
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,230
Let me just pick the example
of the warm person.

835
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,450
The lecturer is rated
as better.

836
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,470
But here's the really
cool part--

837
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:27,380
students took more part
in discussion.

838
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,450
And do you see how
that probably

839
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,530
made the section better?

840
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:32,320
Because if you think this
is a nice person, so

841
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,300
I can make a comment.

842
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,740
I won't get my head bit off that
I didn't do the reading

843
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,320
or whatever, it makes
a section better.

844
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,360
They think it's better, but they
make it better because

845
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,070
they think the person's a person
they want to interact

846
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:45,580
with simply because they were
told on a piece of paper the

847
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,650
person's warm or cold.

848
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,470
The person's identical
time after time.

849
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:52,470
So the first impression,
we know what we like.

850
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,500
It's surprisingly accurate
in certain ways.

851
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,960
But it's hard to change because
new information is

852
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,830
interpreted to be consistent
with already formed

853
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,080
impressions.

854
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,540
So first impressions are
unbelievably interesting

855
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,660
because they seem to be so
powerful in how we choose who

856
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,679
we like and don't like, who we
hire and don't hire, who we

857
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:11,230
work with and don't work with,
who we have relationships and

858
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,570
don't have relationships with.

859
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:14,389
And they're based on incredibly
little bits of

860
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:16,469
information which are
tantalizingly

861
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:18,030
accurate in one sense.

862
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:23,540
But once we have them, it's
hard to override them.

863
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:27,270
So here's a famous experiment
on the self-fulfilling

864
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:29,639
prophecy that happens from this
first impression that you

865
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,900
create, or the experimenter
creates.

866
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,770
So a famous study where
elementary school children

867
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:36,350
gave a test to students.

868
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:38,980
The researchers said, we're
going to tell you whether this

869
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,870
student is going to have-- we
believe, based on our research

870
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,179
at Harvard--

871
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:45,590
a good or bad year.

872
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,870
So you're an elementary
school teacher.

873
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:48,850
And then, you wonder.

874
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:49,840
But they say, oh,
no, we've done

875
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,239
fantastic research at Harvard.

876
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,870
We're the top scholars
in the field.

877
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,920
And we've developed an algorithm
that tells you is

878
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,420
this student going to have a
good year or a bad year?

879
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,950
The teacher gets that
information back.

880
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:03,190
And at the end of the year,
better scores for those kids

881
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:07,590
randomly described as going to
have a good year, worse scores

882
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:09,210
for those kids randomly
described as they're going to

883
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:11,580
have a bad year.

884
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,210
Now, they didn't tape
everything.

885
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:15,010
Nowadays, we could
tape everything.

886
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,550
But what do you guess
that happened?

887
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,520
And this might remind you of an
experiment we talked about

888
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,110
with rats, except now
it's children in

889
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,360
school in real life.

890
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,340

891
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,690
First impression, right?

892
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:29,130
When you've been told by
a crack team of Harvard

893
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:31,750
researchers that some kid is
going to be slumpy, when they

894
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:34,690
make a mistake answering a math
question, you go, oh, why

895
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:38,000
am I spending my time
on this student?

896
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,420
It's not worth my
teaching skills.

897
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,280
Somebody else gives
a good answer or

898
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,070
makes the same mistake.

899
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,220
And you go, oh, we're going
to help this student.

900
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,660
They're one inch away from
being perfect on their

901
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,370
multiplication table.

902
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:51,780
So the very same behavior gets

903
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,330
interpreted as pretty different.

904
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:56,260
Or maybe just remember when
they gave the right answer

905
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,910
really well because you think,
that's that student that got

906
00:35:58,910 --> 00:35:59,890
three and four correctly.

907
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:02,180
But once you that first
impression, all of the other

908
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,035
behaviors start to be
interpreted in that context.

909
00:36:04,035 --> 00:36:08,370

910
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:12,210
So one category of things mixed
into first impressions

911
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:15,330
that have been studied a lot
is consensus physical

912
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:15,900
attractiveness.

913
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,470
Of course, different people
think differently about

914
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:19,400
physical attractiveness.

915
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,070
But in the cultures we live
in, there tends to be

916
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:24,830
consensus about the average
movie star or beauty

917
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:28,360
contestant or whatever
is the era's way of a

918
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,670
people being seen.

919
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:32,045
So people have shown again and
again, this will not surprise

920
00:36:32,045 --> 00:36:34,070
you, that physically attractive
people are judged

921
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:38,180
as more intelligent, competent,
social, and moral.

922
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:41,470
Now, why is that?

923
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,430
So here's an example.

924
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:44,160
Fifth grade teachers were
given report cards and

925
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,720
photographs of children
they did not know.

926
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,380
The photographs were picked to
be of children who looked, by

927
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:52,060
consensus, to be attractive or,
by consensus, to be not so

928
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,650
attractive.

929
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,970
And they're asked to rate, based
on the report cards and

930
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,490
the photos, the intelligence
and

931
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:58,990
achievement of the children.

932
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:01,470
The attractive children ended
up on average rated as

933
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,940
brighter and more successful
than the unattractive children

934
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,980
with identical report cards.

935
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,640
They're sitting there with
all the information.

936
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,360
They're making these
vague judgments.

937
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,280
And the attractiveness element,
even from the photo,

938
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,300
is coming in to the teachers.

939
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:18,420
A child's misbehavior is
attributed to environmental

940
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:22,200
circumstances if it's a more
attractive child and to

941
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,030
personality if it's a less
attractive child.

942
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:26,900
Again, this trade off between
character and situation.

943
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,930
The attractive child
did something bad.

944
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:31,160
Oh, there must have been
something in this situation

945
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,760
that wasn't well done.

946
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,060
The less attractive child
does poorly, and you

947
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:38,010
go, oh, that loser!

948
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:38,770
Right?

949
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:41,070
I'm overstating, but you see
how what's happening is

950
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,170
basically-- well, we'll
talk about it in a

951
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,460
moment, court cases.

952
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,370
People have done studies
on court cases.

953
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:47,550
Shorter sentence for more
attractive people, longer

954
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:50,290
sentence for less attractive
people for what seem to be

955
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:53,650
comparable crimes.

956
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:56,630
So people call this a halo
effect, that you take one

957
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,720
positive dimension
of a person--

958
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,470
it could be any.

959
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:03,200
Physical attractiveness is one
of the easiest ones to

960
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,800
experimentally study.

961
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,735
And once you say one thing is
positive, you tend to rate

962
00:38:07,735 --> 00:38:08,740
other things as positive.

963
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,410
It's just human nature.

964
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:12,470
She's likable, so she's
intelligent.

965
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:15,610
He's attractive,
so he's smart.

966
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,450
People do this.

967
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:20,020
You could argue it's not a wise
thing to, an accurate

968
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,725
thing to do, definitely not.

969
00:38:21,725 --> 00:38:23,060
But people tend to do it.

970
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,450
They'd leak categories.

971
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:26,720
Once they have positive
information in one dimension,

972
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,230
they start to make positive
assumptions in other

973
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:30,180
dimensions.

974
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,520
And there's all kinds
of examples.

975
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,220
There's 1,000 of these studies
because they're easy to do and

976
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,670
they're popular to do.

977
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:39,110
But anyway, so here's one
example where they were told

978
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:43,880
that the goal was to study
teacher evaluations.

979
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,600
And what they really saw were
videos of a lecture of a

980
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,150
person with a strong
Belgian accent.

981
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:52,760
This accent matters for this.

982
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,280
And they saw the videos of a
person answering questions in

983
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,820
a warm and friendly manner or
a cold and distant manner.

984
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:58,810
This was done on purpose.

985
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:03,510
Now, in these two videos, they
rated the person in the warm--

986
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,940
the same person, in one set of
videos they were warm in

987
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,740
answering and the other, they
were cold and distance.

988
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,910
So same person, but
in two videos.

989
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:13,740
Now, they're asked to rate other
dimensions besides the

990
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,630
warmness of the person.

991
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,785
They said, oh, the person who
is warm was more attractive.

992
00:39:17,785 --> 00:39:18,780
Now, it's run the other way.

993
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,540
The nicer person was
more attractive,

994
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,450
more likable, and--

995
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:23,660
kind of impressively--

996
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:26,760
had less of an accent.

997
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,070
You understand?

998
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:30,250
Because accents, the challenge
of accents is sometimes

999
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,010
they're a little hard
to understand.

1000
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:33,750
So you say, how hard was
it to understand?

1001
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,820
Oh, that nice person?

1002
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:39,530
Handsome and pretty easy
to understand.

1003
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:44,610
Less nice person, on purpose
acting out, not so attractive.

1004
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:48,920
And who could understand that
thick Belgian accent?

1005
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,020
They pick the accent because
they say that's ridiculous.

1006
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,120
It's ridiculous that an accent
would differ on the basis of

1007
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,770
whether a person's
nice or not.

1008
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:59,320
But this is thought to be the
reason why you see so many

1009
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:03,860
athletes and movie stars doing
ads because they're asking you

1010
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:07,740
to leak that same way.

1011
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:11,210
Oh, if Kobe Bryant uses that
deodorant, that deodorant must

1012
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:13,450
be awesome.

1013
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:18,190
So that's why they care that
actors, celebrities, that's

1014
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,990
why they have those ads because
many people have

1015
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:21,810
positive feelings about them.

1016
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,930
And if they can leak into
actions, they can certainly

1017
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:27,890
leak into what beer you drink
or what make up you get.

1018
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:36,370
So now, the problems with
these what we might call

1019
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:40,110
shortcuts to judging people,
first impressions and that

1020
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:43,420
kind of stuff, is when we're
making judgements of other

1021
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:47,210
people is that we do this very
quickly and unconsciously.

1022
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:50,200
Nobody thinks, if you ask them,
that they go around

1023
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,970
misjudging people by the basis
of very superficial things.

1024
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:56,250
But 1,000 experiments show
that, on average,

1025
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,760
we tend to do that.

1026
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,770
So these stereotypes
have effects.

1027
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:03,760
Once we make the decision,
in influences our actual

1028
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,840
behavioral.

1029
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,450
So here's one example where
people tried to show this idea

1030
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:12,060
that we might have some sort of
negative idea of somebody

1031
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,320
for some reason.

1032
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,640
Now, here's the self-fulfilling
prophecy.

1033
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,110
Because we have a negative
thought about them, we don't

1034
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:22,060
behave with them as nicely
as we might.

1035
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,460
Now, that person who we haven't
treated nicely, of

1036
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,400
course, is responding to feeling
like they're not

1037
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,400
treated nicely.

1038
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,720
And they go, aha!

1039
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,520
Just what I thought.

1040
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,260
This person stinks.

1041
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,720
And so you have this circle, a
positive or a negative spiral,

1042
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,130
in how you treat somebody, how
they respond to how you treat

1043
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:40,490
them, and how you think
more about them.

1044
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:45,180
So an example they did
of this, again using

1045
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:48,830
attractiveness, the dating
discussion, is they gave in

1046
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:52,050
this case male participants a
picture that suggested a woman

1047
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:54,780
they were talking who they did
not see was either more or

1048
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,700
less conventionally
attractive.

1049
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:00,990
And then, they had a 10 minute
conversation back and forth.

1050
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:03,720
Then, they brought in some other
males in this study.

1051
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,130
And they asked them to listen.

1052
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:06,850
They don't know anything
about the experiment.

1053
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:08,850
They just hear a conversation.

1054
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:11,280
And they say, listen to this
conversation with this woman.

1055
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,330
Tell us from your impression,
how animated is she?

1056
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,830
How enthusiastic is she?

1057
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:18,760
How much is she enjoying herself
in this conversation?

1058
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,880
And this will not
surprise you.

1059
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,670
In fact, in some sense
it's almost trivial.

1060
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:25,030
But in the more attractive
condition-- now, the raters

1061
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:25,650
don't know that.

1062
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:26,270
They don't know anything.

1063
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:28,760
They just hear a discussion
going back and forth.

1064
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,240
The women were more sociable,
poised, humorous,

1065
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,380
and socially adept.

1066
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,750
They were rated that
way by the raters.

1067
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,000
Why?

1068
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,110

1069
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:39,370
Because the men who got the more
attractive pictures were

1070
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:41,500
being nicer in their
conversational style.

1071
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,610
The women were responding,
having a better conversation

1072
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:44,490
back and forth.

1073
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:47,390
And so this is an example of
the cycle between, in this

1074
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:51,010
case, random and misleading
information and the

1075
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:52,530
behavior you have.

1076
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:54,660
And then once you have that
thing, you really start to

1077
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:55,600
alter the situation.

1078
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,720
That impression changes
how you behave.

1079
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,130
The other person responds
to that behavior.

1080
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:02,480
And that's a self-fulfilling
style.

1081
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,140

1082
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,590
Let me switch for just a couple
minutes to talk about

1083
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:11,880
this idea we mentioned before
that the vast majority of

1084
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,780
experimental psychology of the
kind I just described to you

1085
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:17,400
is conducted in what people call
WEIRD societies, Western,

1086
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,240
Educated, Industrial, Rich,
and Democratic.

1087
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,060
There's not a lot of research
in impoverished countries.

1088
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:23,800
There's no research.

1089
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,730
There's no places to do it
or support to do it.

1090
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,510
So a tremendous amount of
research comes from some

1091
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,730
countries like the
United states,

1092
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:34,800
Europe, Australia, Japan.

1093
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,010
And in the coming years, more
and more will come of course

1094
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:41,400
from China and India, South
America and Africa probably

1095
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,790
after that.

1096
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:46,040
Now, it happens that the
countries that produce a lot

1097
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,950
of the research are the
countries that, when people

1098
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:52,120
study societal attitudes towards
individuality versus

1099
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:57,520
fitting in, United States, parts
of Europe, Australia,

1100
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,700
are in the extreme in the
world in emphasizing

1101
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:01,800
individuality.

1102
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,460
In fact, the United states is
seen as a fantastic outlier

1103
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:05,940
among other cultures.

1104
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,770
Maybe Canada's close.

1105
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:11,530
And here's a model that social
psychologists talk about.

1106
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:13,630
It's a very simple
story in a way.

1107
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:15,710
And certainly it's averaging
across lots of people.

1108
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:17,360
So a trouble with cultural
psychology--

1109
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,130
which is where we're at now--

1110
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:20,120
you can do one or two things.

1111
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,350
You can say culture doesn't
matter, which we think is

1112
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:23,590
probably unlikely.

1113
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:26,240
Cultures are huge, the culture
of your home, your community,

1114
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,870
your country, your religion.

1115
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:30,470
All those things influence
people.

1116
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:32,260
But then, when you study it,
you tend to reduce it to

1117
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:34,840
simple things that people
can experimentalize.

1118
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,710
And you tend to, in some
sense, stereotype it.

1119
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:39,640
But anyway, the idea is that
cultures that emphasize

1120
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,400
individuality say you've
got to be yourself.

1121
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,390
And then, you have some
people around you

1122
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,000
you've got to deal with.

1123
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,540
But be yourself!

1124
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:48,420
Move across the country.

1125
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,950
Follow that opportunity.

1126
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:51,240
Be the one.

1127
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,600
And that countries that
emphasize interdependent

1128
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,210
relations are much more talking
about, you'll fulfill

1129
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:58,700
yourself to the extent that you
find some sort of synergy

1130
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:02,150
with those people who
surround you.

1131
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:04,090
And so when they've done more
organized studies-- and I'll

1132
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:07,620
show you now on ads,
on average--

1133
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,740
most of this research previously
has been in Japan

1134
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,350
and South Korea relative
to the United states.

1135
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:13,970
But it's spreading to
other countries.

1136
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:18,050
Many ads in Japan will focus on
groups enjoying themselves.

1137
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:21,950
And the US version is you're
special, you're the one.

1138
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:23,320
Be all that you can be.

1139
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,750
It's you, you, you,
and individuation.

1140
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:29,080
And most of us on average are
brought up in this culture

1141
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:32,300
where we zip across the country
leaving people and

1142
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:33,895
pursuing opportunities
to be ourselves.

1143
00:45:33,895 --> 00:45:37,460

1144
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:41,430
Sleeping arrangements in other
countries or in the US tend to

1145
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:43,300
emphasize this.

1146
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,750
Beginning textbook Dick.

1147
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:46,200
See Dick.

1148
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,500
See Dick run.

1149
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:51,060
Jane is somewhere
in this story.

1150
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:52,900
And so I'll leave these
notes for you.

1151
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,730
But it's this idea, again, what
counts is that you're

1152
00:45:55,730 --> 00:45:59,000
independent or what counts is
that you fit in with others.

1153
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,780
What's the important thing?

1154
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:04,430
So it's very hard in these kinds
of studies like with ads

1155
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:06,510
or anything else to talk about
cultures as a whole.

1156
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:07,700
Things are very complicated.

1157
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:08,870
The worlds are different
in different

1158
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:10,000
countries and all that.

1159
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,880
So people have tried to
do these very simple

1160
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:12,280
experiments--

1161
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,960
I'll show you-- to try to
convince you that at the most

1162
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,100
fundamental level, very
fundamental levels, depending

1163
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:21,970
on the culture you come from,
your mind is tuned to see the

1164
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:25,140
world one way or the other
way relatively speaking.

1165
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,720
And there's variations within
cultures of course.

1166
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,350
But here's a very simple
experiment.

1167
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:31,910
They show you a box like
this with a line.

1168
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:34,270
The size of the box and
the line change

1169
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:36,850
from trial to trial.

1170
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:38,730
They take it away.

1171
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:40,070
And now, you see an empty box.

1172
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:41,530
The empty box could
be the same size,

1173
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:42,910
or bigger, or smaller.

1174
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:47,560
And they say, draw a line that
either has the absolute same

1175
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,390
size as this, even though
the box is different.

1176
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:53,280
Or in other trials, they'll say
draw it so it has the same

1177
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,100
relative, the same ratio,
the same relative size.

1178
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,610
Does that makes sense?

1179
00:46:57,610 --> 00:47:01,260
So here, this would be the same
absolute size, the same

1180
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:01,990
relative size.

1181
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:05,300
Here, this would be the same
relative size or absolute.

1182
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:06,640
Does that makes sense?

1183
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,190
That's all your job
is, draw a line.

1184
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:12,570
And you're told as it's taken
away, draw the same absolute

1185
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:15,220
size in the box or the same
relative size, same

1186
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:17,570
ratio, to the box.

1187
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:20,480
So here's the first thing to
show you, which is that on

1188
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,740
average people in Japan are
more accurate when they're

1189
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:27,930
drawing-- this is mean error,
so it's good to be low--

1190
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:29,770
they're more accurate for
the relative size.

1191
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:32,340
People in the US, for
the absolute size.

1192
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:34,990
And I think that's amazing,
a line in a box.

1193
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:37,610
And we know that's not
culturally taught.

1194
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:39,170
In United States, we don't have
anybody getting up and

1195
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:41,040
saying, be all that
you can be!

1196
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,970
Draw that line in
absolute length!

1197
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:45,850
So the idea is it's not
a taught thing.

1198
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:46,950
It's a way of thinking.

1199
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:49,150
And when you get a new example,
you apply your

1200
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:52,850
culture's way of thinking, many
people much of the time.

1201
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:56,470

1202
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:58,180
How malleable is that?

1203
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:00,300
Is that fixed in you
from birth or not?

1204
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:01,840
And then, you will help
me discover the one

1205
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,190
flaw in this study.

1206
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:06,010
So here's again the
absolute size.

1207
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:08,650
Here's the Americans in America

1208
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:11,120
having the reverse direction.

1209
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,470
Here's Americans who
are students--

1210
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:14,590
graduate students typically--

1211
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:16,630
who have been in Japan
for a year or two.

1212
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:18,810
Here's Japanese graduate
students who've been in the

1213
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:20,770
United states for a year
or two for studies.

1214
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:22,620
And you can see that just
a year or two makes the

1215
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:25,000
Americans look like the
Japanese in Japan.

1216
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,360
And a year or two makes the
Japanese look like Americans

1217
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:28,890
in America.

1218
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:30,950
Does that make sense?

1219
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:34,810
So one interpretation is this
is shockingly malleable.

1220
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:38,920
20 years, 24 years of one
culture, and one or two years

1221
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,800
later, you're shifted into the
mindset of the other culture.

1222
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,460
And maybe that's true.

1223
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:46,940
If you're a very hard nosed
researcher, what do you wish

1224
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:47,855
would have happened
in the study to

1225
00:48:47,855 --> 00:48:49,105
convince you that's true?

1226
00:48:49,105 --> 00:48:52,040

1227
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:52,500
Yeah?

1228
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,946
AUDIENCE: Would they
have gone back?

1229
00:48:53,946 --> 00:48:54,910
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

1230
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:56,840
AUDIENCE: Would they have gone
back when they [INAUDIBLE]?

1231
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,670
PROFESSOR: You could
think about that.

1232
00:48:58,670 --> 00:48:59,930
That's not the way
I'm thinking.

1233
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:00,990
I know I'm doing 20 questions.

1234
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:04,320
So that would be a part
of the story.

1235
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,820
Let me ask you this one.

1236
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:09,570
If you go to MIT and say,
please, all students from

1237
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:10,740
Japan, come and participate.

1238
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,700
Or you go somewhere in Tokyo and
say, please, all students

1239
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,410
from the US come and
participate, is that a random

1240
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,660
assignment?

1241
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:19,390

1242
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:19,730
No.

1243
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:22,800
Maybe the American students
who want to spend time in

1244
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,790
Japan are kind of culturally
attuned with Japan.

1245
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:28,010
That's why they went there.

1246
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:31,820
And maybe they are easily swayed
by that because that's

1247
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:32,630
why they're there.

1248
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:35,630
And maybe these Japanese
students on average are swayed

1249
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:38,990
by American mores because they
came to the US because they

1250
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:40,510
like that way of thinking.

1251
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:43,080
So to really convince yourself
this is really true, you'd

1252
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,480
want to do random assignment
where two people come up to

1253
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,690
you from the US and go,
OK, you go to Japan.

1254
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:51,130
You stay in Flagstaff.

1255
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:53,670
But nobody will agree to
do that reasonably.

1256
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:56,090
So we just have to make
this impression.

1257
00:49:56,090 --> 00:49:58,150
But it's a suggestion that
cultural things could be

1258
00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:00,050
pretty malleable.

1259
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:02,980
And a brain imaging study that
suggests for this line and box

1260
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:09,220
task that it's harder work for
people from East Asia to do

1261
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:10,220
the absolute task.

1262
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:12,120
There's more activation, working
harder, to do the

1263
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,190
absolute task.

1264
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:15,750
And for people from the United
States, working harder to do

1265
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:17,720
the relative task.

1266
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,480
It's not that you
can't see both.

1267
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,040
As you sit there, you understand
what a relative

1268
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,370
size and what an absolute
size is.

1269
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:26,670
It's just harder to take the
culturally non-preferred

1270
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:29,170
perspective.

1271
00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:34,780
So here's a kind of weird
experiment like this.

1272
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:37,930
So knowing now what you know,
imagine you walked up to

1273
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:41,960
people, on average, from Japan,
South Korea, China, or

1274
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:45,780
on average born and grew up
in the United states.

1275
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:48,220
And you said to them, here's
a funny question.

1276
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:50,390
Which is your favorite
shape here, the

1277
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:52,060
diamond or the square?

1278
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:55,620
If you're a rugged United
States Marine Corps

1279
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:59,030
individualist, which
one do you like?

1280
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:02,570

1281
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:04,420
Who's the individualist
in this picture?

1282
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:05,540
The diamond.

1283
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:08,510
I'm a diamond, now
just stand back.

1284
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:10,740
Who's the we're all trying to
get along here correctly, help

1285
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:13,210
each other be interdependent and
form a greater shape from

1286
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:15,310
our synergy?

1287
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:16,850
The squares.

1288
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:18,420
As ridiculous as that is--

1289
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:21,880
or here's the triangle.

1290
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,560
Here's one shape wrong,
different.

1291
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:24,440
Here's the triangles.

1292
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,730
As ridiculous as that question
is, as simple, non-cultural as

1293
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:31,920
it feels, people from the US
like the outstanding figure.

1294
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:36,100
People from Korea tend to like
the more typical figure.

1295
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,020
Here's another one.

1296
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:38,270
This was done in the airport.

1297
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:39,300
Imagine you're in an airport.

1298
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:42,250
This was in the days before 9/11
so we weren't as worried

1299
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:44,630
about people running around
airports running up to us.

1300
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:45,460
Here's how they literally
did it.

1301
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:47,450
At the San Francisco airport,
they would ask you where

1302
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:47,960
you're from.

1303
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:51,290
And if you were from the US or
from Japan or Korea, they

1304
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:53,530
would open a pencil box
like you might have

1305
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:54,830
had as a little kid.

1306
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:56,070
And there'd be a set of
pencils in there.

1307
00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:57,320
And they go, please take one.

1308
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,250
And your first thought is,
OK, what's the deal?

1309
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:01,020
What's the scam?

1310
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,680
Are there any security
people around?

1311
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,100
They go, no, no, just please
take a pencil.

1312
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:04,550
And you go, OK.

1313
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:05,120
And you take one.

1314
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,130
And you think something
bad's going to

1315
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:06,890
happen, and it doesn't.

1316
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:08,330
All they want to know is this.

1317
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:11,330
Do you take the out, the
individualist pencil or the

1318
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:14,170
collectivist pencil?

1319
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:16,360
And there's a one in
four condition or a

1320
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:17,370
two in three condition.

1321
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:18,730
Which pencil do you take?

1322
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:22,090
Ridiculous as this experiment
is, it depends

1323
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:23,450
where you come from.

1324
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:29,680
East Asians on average picked
the majority pen.

1325
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,180
And people born in the US,
European Americans, picked the

1326
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:34,610
minority pen, the stand-out
individual pen.

1327
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:37,380
So to a ludicrous degree,
the experiments

1328
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:38,490
are almost too cute.

1329
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:40,110
But the idea is they want
to get rid of a

1330
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:41,080
lot of cultural overlay.

1331
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,950
And so you're just
picking a pencil.

1332
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:44,610
It's not something that anybody
taught you at home or

1333
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:47,420
in school how to be
or how to do.

1334
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:48,330
There's a similar one.

1335
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:50,070
They would show a picture
like this.

1336
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:51,590
This is an example picture.

1337
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:54,170
First, they would ask people
to describe the picture.

1338
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:58,270
And they noticed that the North
Americans tended to

1339
00:52:58,270 --> 00:52:59,460
focus on the fish.

1340
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:00,970
There's a really big one.

1341
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,510
He's going to eat the
really small one.

1342
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:03,840
That's the way of capitalism.

1343
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,050
I'm being facetious.

1344
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:08,220
But their story was on
the fish on average.

1345
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:11,860
And on average, the people they
studied from Japan talked

1346
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:14,240
about not only the fish, but the
plants in the background

1347
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,770
and things like this
on average.

1348
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:17,310
That's just the average
description.

1349
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:20,700
Then, they give them a memory
test for the fish where the

1350
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,700
fish had the same background,
the same context they were in,

1351
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:27,840
or no background, or they
got a new background.

1352
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,670
And take a look at
the accuracy.

1353
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:32,650
If it's the original background,
so if you took in

1354
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:37,270
the fish with that background,
the context, people from Japan

1355
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:39,390
did better than people from
the United States.

1356
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:42,490
If it's no background, the
individual fish, you stripped

1357
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:45,370
away the background, it
exactly reverses.

1358
00:53:45,370 --> 00:53:47,300
And who does better with
no background?

1359
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:50,730
The people from the
United States.

1360
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:54,500
So such a simple thing like
this, again, seems to be

1361
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,670
driven by this.

1362
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:57,620
Here's one more.

1363
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:01,130
You could say, which is
more similar to this?

1364
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:03,540
So this is similar
by one standout

1365
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,300
rule, the common stem.

1366
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:09,950
These actually share more
similarities if you talk about

1367
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:12,010
the shape of the flower,
the shape of the petal.

1368
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:14,570
But they're different
one from the other.

1369
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:16,610
And again, the European
Americans go for

1370
00:54:16,610 --> 00:54:17,790
the one stand out.

1371
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:20,880
That stem looks solid to me.

1372
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,560
That's the European American.

1373
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,610
And here's the East Asians, not
completely reversed, but

1374
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:28,740
tending to pick the ones that
have the more contextual

1375
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:30,170
similarity.

1376
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:32,570
So here's a half
dozen examples.

1377
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:34,820
And there's 100 more.

1378
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:40,910
And it's just a reminder that
many of the conclusions

1379
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:42,980
throughout this course,
including the ones in social

1380
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:47,490
psychology, focused on people
from North American

1381
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:49,400
universities.

1382
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:50,990
So let's talk about some
of these ones.

1383
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:52,830
So for example, we talked
about the fundamental

1384
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:54,580
attribution error.

1385
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:57,880
It turns out the US is
really big on this.

1386
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:00,820
It's a little bit worldwide,
but the US is an outlier.

1387
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:03,720
We really like to attribute the
actions of others to their

1388
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:07,470
characters and not
their situations.

1389
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:10,390
The attractiveness bias, very
pronounced in the United

1390
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:13,120
States compared to
East Asians.

1391
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:16,000
So we really just find that
one outstanding thing and

1392
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,170
generalize it.

1393
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:20,580
Then, of course, there's
variations within

1394
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:22,270
each culture of course.

1395
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:26,510
But there's cultural teachings
that seem to manifest

1396
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:29,660
themselves in these
experiments.

1397
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:33,240
Any questions on that?

1398
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:36,990
OK, for the last few minutes,
I want to talk about a

1399
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:39,740
disorder that you hear
a lot about.

1400
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:42,660
And if you have questions, I can
answer some questions on

1401
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:45,640
it, autism.

1402
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:47,940
When I was a graduate student
here, you practically never

1403
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,330
heard of it.

1404
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:51,840
Now when you go to the
pediatrician's office,

1405
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,720
practically every parent
is worried about

1406
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:54,490
it for their child.

1407
00:55:54,490 --> 00:55:57,970
It used to be thought of as
a very rare disorder.

1408
00:55:57,970 --> 00:56:03,610
Autism spectrum disorders are
now thought to occur one out

1409
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:09,440
of every something like
that, approaching 1%.

1410
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,490
Have you seen the ads on TV
about the odds of having

1411
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:14,370
autism versus the odds
of making the NBA?

1412
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:16,470
Have any of you seen that?

1413
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:21,460
Incredibly higher by far to have
autism than to make the

1414
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:25,070
NBA or many other things
you can think of.

1415
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:28,060
That's autism awareness efforts
to make people realize

1416
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:29,970
it's shockingly common.

1417
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:31,560
Lots of arguments about
why there's

1418
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:32,490
been a dramatic increase.

1419
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:34,760
I can tell you that for a while
they thought it was

1420
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:38,830
awareness only, that people
didn't realize that certain

1421
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:42,620
children were best understood
as having autism spectrum

1422
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:45,980
disorders, a range of disorders
that share some

1423
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:48,870
properties of difficulties
in social cognition,

1424
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:49,560
communication, and

1425
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:52,110
stereotyped, repetitive movements.

1426
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:55,950
But now, most epidemiologic--

1427
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:57,600
you can't really do
the experiment.

1428
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:00,300
But most people think there
truly is an increasing number

1429
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:03,350
for reasons that are not well
understood on top of

1430
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:04,530
increasing awareness.

1431
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:07,380
Nowadays, they can diagnose
it by age three.

1432
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:11,010
A huge mystery is why there's
four boys to every girl with

1433
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:14,630
autism as far as people have
observed, total mystery.

1434
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:15,880
Nobody has any idea
why that is.

1435
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:21,470

1436
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:23,020
So I'm just going to show you
a few things that have been

1437
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:25,020
found with individuals
with autism.

1438
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:28,330
So one thing is in terms of the
individual with autism,

1439
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:32,190
they don't seem to have a
natural desire to socially

1440
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:34,450
interact with their parents,
their siblings, their

1441
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:35,270
caretakers.

1442
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:38,160
It's hard to get them to do
what's easy for most infants,

1443
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,960
which is interact with
people around you.

1444
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:43,110
That's easy for most infants,
hard for people with autism.

1445
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:44,910
This is eye tracking.

1446
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:45,690
When people--

1447
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:48,020
so this is a path that you
look at when you look at

1448
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:49,500
somebody else.

1449
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:52,170
And what's very common as we
look at people is that we

1450
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:55,880
focus a lot of our attention
to other people's eyes.

1451
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,110
Well, that makes sense.

1452
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:59,330
You know that from your
everyday experience.

1453
00:57:59,330 --> 00:58:01,070
OK, you look at the mouth and
the ear here and there.

1454
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:03,080
But it's the eyes of the other
person that seem very

1455
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,760
communicative socially.

1456
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:07,530
And so you see this triangle
where people go between the

1457
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:10,010
mouth, the speaking mouth, and
the eyes naturally to figure

1458
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:11,510
out what's going on
with the person.

1459
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:13,110
Here's a typical person
with autism.

1460
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:16,340
You see it's like they don't
even look at this eye, don't

1461
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:18,960
focus on the eyes, don't
focus on the eyes.

1462
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,910
The original interpretation of
this was a lack of interest in

1463
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:26,360
looking at these faces
as social targets.

1464
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,640
There's an additional thought
that maybe, for some

1465
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,900
individuals or many with autism,
there's something

1466
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:34,850
uncomfortable with
dealing with a

1467
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:37,140
social agent or a person.

1468
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:39,580
So that's eye tracking.

1469
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:42,880
And by the way, the same
thing when they were--

1470
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,830
this is spontaneous,
the first picture,

1471
00:58:44,830 --> 00:58:45,590
wherever you want to look.

1472
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:47,410
Now they said, tell us what
the expression is.

1473
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:49,010
So you have a task to do.

1474
00:58:49,010 --> 00:58:52,040
And again, pretty much like
before, typically developing

1475
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:54,820
people focus on the eyes, a
little bit on the mouth.

1476
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:59,350
And again, you can see these
very wayward locations of

1477
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:03,450
where individuals with autism
put their glances.

1478
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:05,710
So you can just imagine a very
different social interaction

1479
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:08,490
if somebody's looking here or
here at somebody versus the

1480
00:59:08,490 --> 00:59:09,740
person's eyes.

1481
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:13,020

1482
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:15,340
There's been a fantastic amount
of research about what

1483
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:17,870
are brain differences in people
with autism spectrum

1484
00:59:17,870 --> 00:59:19,200
disorders and those without.

1485
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:23,180
There's a fantastic variation
among every disorder, but you

1486
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:24,730
might say autism even
more, or every

1487
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:25,950
difference, autism even more.

1488
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:28,880
It seems like there's just a
fantastic variation among

1489
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,290
people with autism.

1490
00:59:30,290 --> 00:59:33,110
But the one finding that's held
up is this, which is that

1491
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:35,750
if you measure the total
brain size--

1492
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:37,950
which is a very gross measure
of the brain--

1493
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:41,120
that there seems to be early in
development, up until age

1494
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:44,630
five, an overgrowth of the brain
size in individuals with

1495
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:47,580
autism that gets back
in development

1496
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:49,390
to the typical size.

1497
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:50,930
This is the most replicated.

1498
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:53,830
Every number here is a different
research study.

1499
00:59:53,830 --> 00:59:56,900
So you can see all of these
up here are clumped here.

1500
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:58,530
This is the single
most replicable

1501
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:00,350
finding by far in autism.

1502
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:03,760
There's an early, apparent
overgrowth of the brain.

1503
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,700
What that means, why that's
associated with difficulties

1504
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:10,300
in social interaction or
repetitive movements,

1505
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:12,320
stereotyped interests
is hard to know.

1506
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:15,460

1507
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:17,340
Early in the course, we
mentioned and we talked about

1508
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:20,410
theory of mind, understanding
what thoughts

1509
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:21,410
another person holds.

1510
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:23,690
And sometimes it's not even
consistent with the physical,

1511
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:24,830
real world.

1512
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:30,490
I mentioned to you that it's
severely delayed in autism,

1513
01:00:30,490 --> 01:00:31,770
years later.

1514
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:33,940
So this is comparing
four-year-olds typically

1515
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:37,230
developing versus 6 to
12-year-olds with autism.

1516
01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:38,865
And the four-year-olds
outperform the individuals

1517
01:00:38,865 --> 01:00:40,800
with autism on theory
of mind tasks.

1518
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:46,830
So huge delay in understanding
what the independent mental

1519
01:00:46,830 --> 01:00:48,660
life is like of another
person.

1520
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:49,337
Yeah?

1521
01:00:49,337 --> 01:00:52,840
AUDIENCE: How do you find, in
general, IQs of people with

1522
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,362
autism compared to--?

1523
01:00:54,362 --> 01:00:57,730
PROFESSOR: So the question
is how are IQs in autism?

1524
01:00:57,730 --> 01:01:00,690
So the answer is you measure--

1525
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:03,570
so half of individuals with
autism are non-verbal.

1526
01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:06,500
You can't even give
them a test.

1527
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,360
Those are not the ones who
tend to be represented in

1528
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:12,560
research, behavioral research or
brain research, because you

1529
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,620
can't even ask them
to do things.

1530
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:18,430
So all the research is skewed
towards the higher functioning

1531
01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:20,610
individuals with autism.

1532
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:25,210
If you just took their average
IQ, it would be lowish.

1533
01:01:25,210 --> 01:01:29,790
But there's many individuals
with very high IQs also.

1534
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:32,860
And in fact, what's called
Asperger's syndrome

1535
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:35,510
specifically refers to
individuals who have the

1536
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:40,240
social difficulties
characteristic of autism, but

1537
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:43,510
have a very high functioning
cognitive and IQ level.

1538
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:46,020
So it runs the whole range.

1539
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:47,670
If you just took the average,
it'd be low.

1540
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:51,060
But there's many individuals
who are very high in IQ.

1541
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:53,580
And so in this study, for
example, they matched IQ by

1542
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:55,850
having, in this case,
four year olds and

1543
01:01:55,850 --> 01:01:56,516
six to 12 year olds.

1544
01:01:56,516 --> 01:01:58,140
The IQ was even.

1545
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:00,560
And still, the theory of mind
was much weaker in the

1546
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,010
individuals with autism.

1547
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:03,590
But it's incredibly
variable, the IQs.

1548
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:07,320

1549
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:12,060
So here's another way that
people have studied two things

1550
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:13,810
at once we talk about--

1551
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:18,790
the human nature to ascribe
social things, social stories

1552
01:02:18,790 --> 01:02:20,470
to things and then how
that plays out

1553
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:21,590
differently in autism.

1554
01:02:21,590 --> 01:02:24,980
So this is famous work from
Heider and Simmel.

1555
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:27,970
And you're going to see these
two triangles do something.

1556
01:02:27,970 --> 01:02:30,540
And I want you to figure
out what they're doing.

1557
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:33,110

1558
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:34,875
What happened there, socially?

1559
01:02:34,875 --> 01:02:38,214

1560
01:02:38,214 --> 01:02:40,340
I need somebody to put their
hand up, and the other

1561
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:41,295
people-- help me out.

1562
01:02:41,295 --> 01:02:42,555
Somebody, put your hand
up and tell me what

1563
01:02:42,555 --> 01:02:44,140
you thought you saw.

1564
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:45,810
Second last quarter left
of the whole course.

1565
01:02:45,810 --> 01:02:46,970
We gotta have somebody put--

1566
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:48,110
OK, what do you think you saw?

1567
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:49,050
AUDIENCE: They were dancing.

1568
01:02:49,050 --> 01:02:49,750
PROFESSOR: They were
kind of dancing.

1569
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:51,330
Anything else?

1570
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:52,908
Yeah?

1571
01:02:52,908 --> 01:02:53,886
Go ahead.

1572
01:02:53,886 --> 01:02:56,036
AUDIENCE: That the big one was
trying to get the little one

1573
01:02:56,036 --> 01:02:58,330
to go outside, but the little
one was scared.

1574
01:02:58,330 --> 01:03:01,040
PROFESSOR: Yeah, there's no
right answer, by the way.

1575
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:04,270
But one I heard, which is
coaxing, that the little one

1576
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:04,820
was scared.

1577
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:05,950
They were playing together.

1578
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:07,880
They're having a nice
relationship.

1579
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,590
Then, the little one doesn't
want to go outside the box.

1580
01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:11,440
Then, the big one has to
coax and support them.

1581
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,910
Were you going to
say that, too?

1582
01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:15,980
Any other thoughts
or feelings?

1583
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:17,900
So yeah, the most common
interpretation of this-- and

1584
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:20,120
Heider and Simmel, their
original point was that humans

1585
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:23,580
want to give social descriptions
to everything.

1586
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:25,640
Two triangles, what are
you talking about?

1587
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:28,640
But almost, if we just let our
mind go just a little bit,

1588
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:30,410
we're almost giving
them animacy.

1589
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:32,180
They're moving themselves
around.

1590
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:34,030
They're having social
interactions.

1591
01:03:34,030 --> 01:03:36,300
They have stories where
sometimes there's a bully

1592
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:38,930
beating up the little, big
circle beating up a little

1593
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:40,590
circle or dot.

1594
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:44,140
And we tend to make up these
little stories very easily.

1595
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:45,445
So the first thing to tell you
is that individuals with

1596
01:03:45,445 --> 01:03:49,330
autism on average, again a big
range on average, don't see

1597
01:03:49,330 --> 01:03:50,920
these stories so much.

1598
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:55,200
They say on average the two
triangles, what do you mean?

1599
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,950
And you could say that's
not even wrong.

1600
01:03:57,950 --> 01:04:01,590
It's just not the way people
typically interpret things

1601
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:03,560
that we typically look
for socially.

1602
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,620
And then, you look
in the brain.

1603
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:06,620
And what happens is this.

1604
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:09,490
This is brain responses to these
social stories where we

1605
01:04:09,490 --> 01:04:12,090
tend to give it a social
explanation

1606
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:13,080
versus random displays.

1607
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:14,650
They can also display where
things whizzing around and

1608
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:16,680
nobody thinks anything's
happening.

1609
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:19,230
And what they see is in the
visual cortex, this part of

1610
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,790
the brain that sees the
things, there's equal

1611
01:04:21,790 --> 01:04:24,130
activation in the two groups.

1612
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:26,420
But in parts of the brain that
we think are involved in

1613
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:29,740
social interaction, like the
superior temporal sulcus,

1614
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:32,570
medial prefrontal cortex, areas
from a lot of research

1615
01:04:32,570 --> 01:04:35,770
that we believe is involved in
thinking about other people

1616
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:38,530
and their feelings and thoughts,
there's very little

1617
01:04:38,530 --> 01:04:41,330
engagement of these areas in
individuals with autism in

1618
01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:42,630
this study.

1619
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:44,030
So they don't see the
same stories.

1620
01:04:44,030 --> 01:04:47,210
And they don't turn on social
parts of the brain that are

1621
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:50,800
spontaneously turned on by
typically developing people.

1622
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:56,420
And here's the last experiment
I'll show you which is this.

1623
01:04:56,420 --> 01:05:00,000
So it turns out our brains
respond and our minds respond

1624
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,355
very strongly to where people
are looking, where their gaze

1625
01:05:04,355 --> 01:05:05,660
is falling.

1626
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:08,870
So imagine that you're
talking to somebody.

1627
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:10,370
You're telling them something.

1628
01:05:10,370 --> 01:05:11,410
And their eyes are here.

1629
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:12,615
Does that bother you?

1630
01:05:12,615 --> 01:05:15,940
OK, yes because we think their
eyes tell us where their

1631
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:17,300
attention is.

1632
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:20,190
And if they're not focused on
us, they're not interested.

1633
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:21,630
And we're offended.

1634
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:25,750
So here's the experiment now
where they have a computer

1635
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:26,920
model like this.

1636
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:29,860
And they throw on suddenly
a display.

1637
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:31,470
And the person either
looks this way

1638
01:05:31,470 --> 01:05:32,490
or looks the opposite.

1639
01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:35,310
Which would you think is the
natural way a person would

1640
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:38,210
look naturally if something
interesting

1641
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:40,220
happened over here?

1642
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:41,610
They would look towards it.

1643
01:05:41,610 --> 01:05:44,340
It'd be kind of weird to
look away from it.

1644
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:46,170
And when you look at brain
imaging at what happens in

1645
01:05:46,170 --> 01:05:49,060
those conditions in the superior
temporal sulcus and

1646
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:51,430
other places, typically
developing people for the

1647
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:54,200
weird looking away, it's like
a mystery to be solved.

1648
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:54,730
What's going on?

1649
01:05:54,730 --> 01:05:56,290
Why aren't they looking
at this?

1650
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:56,750
Are they angry?

1651
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:58,730
Is there something better
over there?

1652
01:05:58,730 --> 01:05:59,770
it's a social mystery.

1653
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:01,550
Why is this person
not looking?

1654
01:06:01,550 --> 01:06:03,450
And there's no difference in
those two conditions in the

1655
01:06:03,450 --> 01:06:08,000
study for individuals with
autism as if eyes are looking

1656
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,440
here, eyes are looking there.

1657
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:11,540
It's just where eyes
are looking.

1658
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:13,310
What's the difference?

1659
01:06:13,310 --> 01:06:16,640
There's not the spontaneous
social interpretation or

1660
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,660
mystery that needs
to be understood.

1661
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:20,470
So these are just some of the
differences that people have

1662
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:23,050
observed looking at the
brains and behavior

1663
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:24,300
of people with autism.

1664
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:25,870
Any questions about autism?

1665
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:32,310

1666
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:32,750
Yeah?

1667
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:34,121
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1668
01:06:34,121 --> 01:06:36,410
in the brain activates
[INAUDIBLE]?

1669
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:37,170
PROFESSOR: Yes.

1670
01:06:37,170 --> 01:06:39,160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

1671
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:39,960
PROFESSOR: That's
a good question.

1672
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:43,330
Do those parts of the brain,
the areas that in typical

1673
01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:45,880
people are turned on for social
cognition, when we

1674
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:48,070
think about what another
person's thinking or feeling,

1675
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:49,890
do they ever turn on in
individuals with autism?

1676
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:51,800
The answer is yes, they do.

1677
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:52,960
I can tell you that I'm showing
you some of the

1678
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,660
simplest things and probably
roughly correct.

1679
01:06:55,660 --> 01:06:58,080
But there's such a fantastic
variety among people with

1680
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:00,770
autism and even within
the person.

1681
01:07:00,770 --> 01:07:03,080
Just a very little bit of
different of a condition, all

1682
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:05,060
of a sudden, some of these
areas will turn on.

1683
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:07,340
It's been a very big mystery.

1684
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:08,930
And we don't know whether that's
because we just don't

1685
01:07:08,930 --> 01:07:11,650
understand it right or whether
the variety among patients is

1686
01:07:11,650 --> 01:07:13,990
so great that we're making the
wrong conclusions, saying

1687
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:15,970
autism is like this.

1688
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:18,710
And that may be true of 5% of
individuals with autism.

1689
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:22,300
So it's a huge mystery in many
ways, and an important one

1690
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:26,440
because all of a sudden, it's
almost 1%, one out of every

1691
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:27,690
100 children.

1692
01:07:27,690 --> 01:07:48,650
