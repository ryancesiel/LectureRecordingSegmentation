10
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:29,640
PROFESSOR: So when we talked
about learning, we said that

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,280
everything we know comes from
learning except that which is

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,410
given to us by our genes.

13
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,550
Our knowledge of how to walk
around in the world, to read,

14
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,530
to think, to talk, to feel, the
values that we have, the

15
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,980
hopes we have, the fears we
have, they're all learned

16
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,400
through experience.

17
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,200
And then we talked about another
approach to thinking

18
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,690
about how we learn things
through memory, and today I'm

19
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,030
going to talk about what we
understand to be the brain

20
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,380
organization of human memory.

21
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,050
And Oliver Sacks, in The Lost
Mariner, chapter 2, talks

22
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:04,480
about one of the two major kinds
of amnesia, the loss of

23
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,050
memory due to a brain disorder
or a brain injury.

24
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,960
But he has a very nice language
from Luis Bunuel

25
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,100
talking about memory. "You
have begun to lose your

26
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,780
memory, if only in bits and
pieces, to realize that memory

27
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,450
is what makes our life.

28
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,570
Life without memory
is no life at all.

29
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,110
Our memories, our coherence, our
reason, our feeling, even

30
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:21,740
our action.

31
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,290
Without it, we are nothing.

32
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,870
I can only wait for the final
amnesia, the one that erases

33
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:26,890
an entire life as it did

34
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,120
my mother's." Right?

35
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,360
So our memories of our lives,
what we've done, where we've

36
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,760
been, what mattered to us--

37
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,370
that's a huge piece
of who we are.

38
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:41,290
And he runs into a patient who
came into the hospital early

39
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:45,280
in 1975 with a note saying
"Helpless, demented, confused,

40
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,580
and disoriented." He
had what we call

41
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,610
clinically Korsakoff's Syndrome.

42
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:55,500
So these are individuals who
have severe alcoholism for

43
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,170
many years, and a subset of
those people develop a severe

44
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,260
memory disorder,
like this man.

45
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,630
He's 49 years old.

46
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,970
He tells Sacks about his life,
details of his life, going

47
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,630
into World War II, that
he worked on a

48
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,500
submarine, and so on.

49
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,870
And Sacks says, "a full and
interesting life remembered

50
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,650
visually in detail, but for some
reason his memories stop

51
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:19,850
around World War II."

52
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,270
Then he asked him,
what year is it?

53
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,250
Remember the year is 1975.

54
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,950
And he says, it's 1945.

55
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:25,810
What do you mean?

56
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,960
We've won the war, FDR--

57
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,060
Franklin Delano Roosevelt-- is
dead, Truman's at the helm.

58
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,700
These are great times ahead.

59
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,880
And Jimmy, how old
would you be?

60
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,820
He stopped and he said,
well, I guess I'm 19.

61
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,400
That would have been his age,
you know, 20 years ago, right?

62
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,620
30 years ago.

63
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,920
So he's stuck in time.

64
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,860
He thinks it's historically
a while ago.

65
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,390
He has the completely
wrong age.

66
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,580
And Sacks takes out a mirror and
throws it at him and says,

67
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,640
what do you--

68
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,440
what happened?

69
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,220
And he says, Jesus Christ,
what's going on?

70
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:52,700
What happened?

71
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,200
Is this a nightmare?

72
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,730
Am I crazy?

73
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:54,680
Is this a joke?

74
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,560
So it's as if he's lost the
last 30 years of his life.

75
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,640
And he's living as if it
were 30 years ago.

76
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,230

77
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,680
And then when he walks back in,
he's hardly recognized.

78
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,770
Sacks is hardly recognized
by the person.

79
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,830
On intelligence, he shows
excellent ability, but his

80
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,710
memory-- very quickly,
he forgets things.

81
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,560
What is this, I asked him,
showing him a photo in a

82
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,450
magazine I was holding.

83
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,590
It's the moon.

84
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,240
No it's not, if it's a
picture of the Earth

85
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,530
taken from the moon.

86
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,110
I'm mean, don't forget, in 1945,
nobody imagined that we

87
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,250
would be sending up people
to the moon, right?

88
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,330
And taking pictures from
the moon of the Earth.

89
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:30,970
You're used to it.

90
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,630
It's nothing to you.

91
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,150
No it's not.

92
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,140
It's a picture of the Earth
taken from the moon.

93
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:35,760
Doc, you're kidding.

94
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,510
Somebody would have to get
a camera up there.

95
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,000
Naturally.

96
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,730
Hell, you're joking.

97
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,940
How would you know that?

98
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:46,920
So he has lost the last 30 years
of his life, for all

99
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,650
practical purposes,
despite normal

100
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,680
intelligence and normal thought.

101
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,000
So we're going to talk more
about how this occurs in

102
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,180
another patient, and more
generally, how the brain

103
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,820
supports your ability
to learn things.

104
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,730
So here's this remarkable
brain.

105
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,520
And in one sense, you could say
it's almost all there to

106
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,620
absorb things in life.

107
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,910
You have very small insects
that can do a lot with the

108
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,830
genes they're given.

109
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:17,700
We have big brains to learn
the life we lead.

110
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,320
And I'm going to come back at
the end to this metaphor, but

111
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,740
the idea that in many ways, your
brain as you sit there

112
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,150
right now, or any healthy
brain, is kind of like a

113
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:31,700
symphony orchestra that has many
specialized instruments

114
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,850
for learning different
kinds of things.

115
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,650
And you feel like a unified
whole, and you are, and these

116
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,270
instruments interact
with each other.

117
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,980
But just like a symphony
orchestra, you know, together

118
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,340
they make a sound.

119
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,340
So imagine you're a Martian who
lands outside a symphony

120
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,950
hall, and you hear a
symphony playing.

121
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:49,790
It's something beautiful.

122
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,420
It sounds really interesting.

123
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,360
If you're a Martian on the
outside of the symphony hall,

124
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,810
how many instruments are you
guessing, how many things

125
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,870
might you guess, are
making that sound?

126
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,860
Would you have any idea?

127
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,430
One big one?

128
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,220
Two big ones?

129
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,490
50?

130
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,000
It'd be very hard to guess.

131
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,710
And it's only been in the last
20 years or so that we had

132
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,240
some real clarification
on the instruments of

133
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,380
learning in our brains.

134
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,260
So I'm going to talk about
three things today.

135
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,880
Anterograde amnesia, the loss
of the ability to form new

136
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,540
memories; retrograde amnesia,
the loss of memories you

137
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:27,610
already had; and that idea of
memory systems, this idea that

138
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,650
each of us has a symphony of
learning instruments in our

139
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,990
brain that empowers us to learn

140
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,610
different kinds of things.

141
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,650
So anterograde amnesia is,
again, the inability to

142
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,550
remember new information.

143
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,830
And people mostly talk about
two kinds, but as you see,

144
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,670
they're most of life, OK?

145
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,220
Not all of that-- we'll talk
about that-- but a lot of it,

146
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,190
such as events you experience
or facts you encounter.

147
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,400
So think about this.

148
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,380
All the events you've remembered
from your entire

149
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,840
life, all the facts you ever
learned in school, at home, on

150
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,860
the computer--

151
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,170
that's a huge amount
of what you know.

152
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,350
And a patient like we just
described or the patients I'll

153
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:04,090
describe in a moment lose the
ability to remember any event

154
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:07,180
from the day they become amnesic
or remember much in

155
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,990
the way of new information
of any kind, in terms of

156
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,570
facts of the world.

157
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,740
So in what sense is memory
in the brain

158
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,830
distributed or localized?

159
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,760
In what sense is it in one
place or many places?

160
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,430
And this has been a central
debate in all of neuroscience,

161
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,430
but in memory, too.

162
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,680
And Karl Lashley, a giant of
neuroscience, who worked just

163
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,570
two T stops away at Harvard,
said this: "It is not possible

164
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:31,540
to demonstrate the isolated
localization of a memory trace

165
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,810
anywhere in the nervous
system.

166
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,730
The engram is represented
throughout the brain." The

167
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,700
engram's kind of a magic word
in memory and the brain.

168
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,850
The engram is the thing in you
that changes in your brain

169
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,110
that is the stuff of a memory.

170
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:48,250
If you learn today that there's
more terrible news in

171
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,770
Japan with the nuclear reactors,
and you remember

172
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,740
that because it matters to you,
because you care about

173
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:58,670
the people, there's a physical
change in your brain that is

174
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,230
the memory.

175
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,400
If you remember what I'm saying
now for more than a few

176
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,070
moments, that is a physical
change in your brain.

177
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,430
So all of us in neuroscience
are amazed by that.

178
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,240
How can we physically change the
brain to be the biological

179
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,230
record of a memory,
that we can keep

180
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,730
and use in the future?

181
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,350
And the engram, Karl Lashley
said, is represented

182
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,550
throughout the brain.

183
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,150
It's spread throughout
the brain.

184
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,830
Here's why he thought that.

185
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,740
So he was working with rats,
and they ran a maze.

186
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,340
And you saw how quickly you
learned the maze to go from

187
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,240
start to finish to get the
food if you're a rat.

188
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,590
And here's what he found, and
the results won't amaze you,

189
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,890
to start with.

190
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,150
So what he did is he made--

191
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,550
this is number of errors
during learning, so

192
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,710
it's good to be low.

193
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,480
And this is how much neocortex
they took out, ranging from

194
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,860
10% to 80%.

195
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,790
And he discovered that the more
neocortex you took out,

196
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,130
the worse learner you were.

197
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,140
Now if it didn't happen in some
broad sense, we'd say,

198
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,150
well, what part of us
is learning it?

199
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,030
You take out more brain, you're
less of a good reader.

200
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,210
10% out, 10% percent
bad memory.

201
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:01,360
50% of brain out, 50%
of bad memory.

202
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,030
80% of the brain out, 80%
bad memory, right?

203
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,260
OK, that makes sense.

204
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,040
But what he was really impressed
by is it didn't seem

205
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:12,360
to him to matter where he took
the brain out of the rat.

206
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,360
It just didn't matter.

207
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,450
It's just the percent
that he took out.

208
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,480
Whatever percent he took
out is how bad

209
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,730
the learner you were.

210
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,415
And we'll come back to that, but
that's why I said, it must

211
00:08:20,415 --> 00:08:22,880
be spread everywhere, because
wherever I take out brain,

212
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,430
part of the memory is weakened
or disappears.

213
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,210
And sometimes people call that
mass action for distributed

214
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,950
memory, that's spread
throughout the brain

215
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,000
in this mass way.

216
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,280
It's just spread all
over the place.

217
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,760
And a single clinical case--

218
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,990
I'll spend a few moments
on him for two reasons.

219
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,320
It is the historical case that
turned this around, and I have

220
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,059
a particular perspective on
this because when I was a

221
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:46,680
graduate student, I did a lot
of work with this single

222
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,560
patient whose case turned around
our understanding of

223
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,350
the mammalian brain
and memory.

224
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,250
So as I start to
talk about it--

225
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,740
I can't tell you what Phineas
Gage was really like, beyond

226
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,580
what I read, OK?

227
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,580
Or Broca's patients
from the 1900s.

228
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,860
I can tell you what HM, the man
we're about to talk about,

229
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,980
was like because I spent many,
many hours with him, two

230
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,530
blocks from here, when I was a
graduate student in Suzanne

231
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:06,790
Corkin's lab.

232
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,800
So the structure we'll focus
on is something called the

233
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,530
hippocampus.

234
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,060
It looks sort of big
in the picture.

235
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,300
It's about the size of about 2/3
of your thumb, one on the

236
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,020
left and one on the right in the
insides of the medial part

237
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:19,880
of the temporal lobes.

238
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,460
A pretty small percentage
of the brain.

239
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,910
And you can see it's
located here.

240
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,380
Here it is sort of drawn out.

241
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,100
And here's the story
of this man.

242
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,760
He died a couple years ago.

243
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,640
There's lots of plays and movies
and books in the works.

244
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,870
I can also tell you that when I
was a graduate student here,

245
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,390
my fellow graduate students
would say, tell us who HM,

246
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:43,320
what his initials really stand
for, as if it really mattered,

247
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,570
particularly.

248
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:47,270
But I felt privileged to have
the secret knowledge of what

249
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:47,710
his name was.

250
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,980
When he died, they
published it.

251
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,190
Everybody knows now, so
my secret is out.

252
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,450
Or our secret is out.

253
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,650
He was born in 1926.

254
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:58,520
At age 16 he had his first
major epileptic seizure.

255
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:03,140
By age 27, he was having many,
many seizures a day.

256
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,060
You can have petit mal seizures,
where you tune out

257
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,030
from the world.

258
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,990
You can have grand mal seizures
that lead to physical

259
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,240
convulsions.

260
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,830
By age 27, the medications were
not helping him, in 1953,

261
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,940
very much, that were
available.

262
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,280
And he was just sitting in his
house just waiting for the

263
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,210
next seizure, basically.

264
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,700
That was his life.

265
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,650
He was a man of normal
intelligence and fairly

266
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,980
typical, average background.

267
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,920
Nothing remarkable.

268
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,710
And in order to treat the
epilepsy, William Scoville,

269
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,980
the surgeon, resected, or took
out surgically, the tissue.

270
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,960
Here's this cartoon of
what he took out--

271
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,160
the hippocampus, also the
amygdala just in front of it,

272
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,010
also tissue that surrounds it.

273
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,860
And the reason he took it out
is the single most likely

274
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,360
place where epileptic seizures
start is the hippocampus.

275
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,660
It's kind of a signal, in many
ways, that the hippocampus

276
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,570
does something very dangerous.

277
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,530
It's operating in some sort
of fast speed lane of

278
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,550
neurobiology.

279
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:01,310
It's a very sensitive part of
the brain, for lack of oxygen,

280
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,850
for diseases.

281
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,070
We'll talk about Alzheimer's
today.

282
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,840
It's a very vulnerable part
of the brain, but it does

283
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,490
something magical and essential
for memory.

284
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,690
And so they couldn't locate
where the seizures were

285
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,110
starting, very well, from him in
ways they typically do, so

286
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,720
they said, OK.

287
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,750
He has all these seizures.

288
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,040
We don't know what to do.

289
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,480
Let's take out the left and the
right hippocampus and the

290
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,890
surrounding tissue.

291
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,970
And in terms of seizure
control, it was pretty

292
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,040
successful.

293
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,040
He had to stay on medications
from that day 'til a few years

294
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,960
ago, when he passed away.

295
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,480
But he had very, very
few seizures

296
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,350
compared to before that.

297
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,800
So it was medically
very successful in

298
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,500
terms of seizure control.

299
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,490
It had a giant side effect.

300
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:45,150
From that day 'til a couple
years ago, HM never formed a

301
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:48,320
new memory for any event, or
for all practical purposes,

302
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,210
for any fact that he was exposed
to ever again, despite

303
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:56,350
his normal intelligence and his

304
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,050
otherwise intact abilities.

305
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,720
So they took an MR of HM.

306
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,530
It took a long time to decide
they could even take a MR

307
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:06,770
picture of HM, because they were
very worried that if you

308
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:10,010
put him in a MR scanner, there's
magnetic fields, and

309
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,050
often they put in clips
after surgery.

310
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,490
Regularly they put in clips
after surgery, to keep the

311
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,940
vessels from bleeding.

312
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,570
And they weren't sure
what the clips were

313
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:19,980
made of for a while.

314
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,630
And so they said, well, we can't
put him in, because we

315
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:26,650
could move the clips and kill
him, which would be bad.

316
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,520
So they thought it
was dangerous.

317
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,340
And they did a huge detective
process of going to factory

318
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,490
that made them and talking to
people who built it before

319
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,980
they decided-- it took, like, 10
years of research to decide

320
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,700
that the clips were not metal
and they could take an MR.

321
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,010
And even here-- here's the top
of the brain, normal person.

322
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,070
Here's the hippocampus, the
small structure in you--

323
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,320
pretty small.

324
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,390
It's removed in him, but you
can see he's got a lot of

325
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:51,240
brain left, except for these
removed structures.

326
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,860
But what happened was he had
such a fantastic impairment of

327
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,180
learning new information,
it got the

328
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,780
label of a global amnesia.

329
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,970
Global amnesia.

330
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,750
It didn't matter whether tests
were hard, like remembering

331
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,610
stuff or multiple choice.

332
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,050
He failed practically every
standard test of memory you'd

333
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,070
ever give a person.

334
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:11,120
Or if it's words or nonsense
syllables, faces, clicks,

335
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,800
mazes, public events,
assassinations of presidents,

336
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,660
wars, going to the
moon, whatever

337
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,490
you think of as famous--

338
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,420
he didn't know they
happened at all.

339
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,430
Personal events.

340
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,300
The death of his own parents.

341
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,720
If you asked him how his parents
were doing, he would

342
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,830
say something like, I haven't
seen them for a while.

343
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,860
He would not know they
had passed away.

344
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,710
So no matter how publicly
famous something was, no

345
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,860
matter how personally important
it was, that

346
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,610
knowledge--

347
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,860
he could remember it for a few
seconds, and we'll talk about

348
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,480
that more, but it
would drift away

349
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,030
completely within seconds.

350
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,930
No matter how often he heard it,
no matter how personally

351
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,380
important it was.

352
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,360
And you could say, what does he
say his experience is like?

353
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,520
So Brenda Milner, the
neuropsychologist, who did a

354
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,990
lot of the critical original
research with him, describing

355
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:59,220
his case said that he's said,
"Every day is alone in itself,

356
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,460
whatever joy I've had and
whatever sorrow I've had." I

357
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,040
mean, it sounds very poetic, and
it's true, except that for

358
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,200
HM, his memory lasts seconds.

359
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,730
So he doesn't remember any day
since 1950 or something.

360
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,220
So I think his experience is
more like this. "Right now I'm

361
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,310
wondering, Have I done or
said anything amiss?

362
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,700
You see, at this moment,
everything looks clear to me."

363
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,050
His mind is clear.

364
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,070
He's smart.

365
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,720
"But what happened just before?"
What happened a

366
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,160
minute ago, or two minutes
ago, or five minutes ago?

367
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,270
"That's what worries me.

368
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,740
It's like waking from a
dream; I just don't

369
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,280
remember." All right?

370
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,160
So when we worked with him here,
a few blocks from here,

371
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,640
he wouldn't know who I was.

372
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,960
He wouldn't know why
he was here.

373
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,670
He was an extremely pleasant
and wonderful research

374
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,670
participant.

375
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,980
A piece of that was-- he was
very nice and very pleasant.

376
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,720
A piece of that was he didn't
know time was passing.

377
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,840
So if any of you are involved
in experiments as

378
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,690
participants, sometimes people
enjoy the experiment for about

379
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,150
five minutes but not for the
next 55, because they're

380
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,390
getting a lot of measurements
to get a good measurement.

381
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,540
For HM, it was never an
hour-long experiment.

382
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,840
It was always a minute and
a half experiment.

383
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,470
So you had to be very careful
not to abuse that situation as

384
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,160
a researcher.

385
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,030
So here's his name,
Henry Molaison.

386
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:15,660
Here's his pictures from his
youth and from this.

387
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,100
But you see how he had
a complete reversal?

388
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,600
All of a sudden, the removal
just two small regions-- the

389
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,510
left and the right hippocampus
in the brain--

390
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:27,400
stopped the creation, of
formation of new memories

391
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,230
altogether and in any
practical way.

392
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,440
So that shows you that memory's
not spread throughout

393
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,280
the brain in a sort of
undifferentiated mass-action

394
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:40,120
way, but that particular parts
of the brain play very

395
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,800
particular roles in how
memories are formed.

396
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,210
And the hippocampus plays
a huge role in that.

397
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:44,700
Can't see it.

398
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,900
So they had a big project where
they brought him from

399
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,700
the nursing home in Connecticut
where he was.

400
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,630
They drove him by ambulance to

401
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,470
Massachusetts General Hospital.

402
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:58,670
They overnight did a something
like an eight hour MRI scan on

403
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,770
him, to have the world's most
detailed MRI scan you

404
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,650
practically have on anybody.

405
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,760
And then they removed his
brain and sent it to a

406
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:09,090
laboratory in San Diego, where
they took his brain and they

407
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:12,895
sliced it into many, many, many
incredibly thin slices

408
00:16:12,895 --> 00:16:14,850
that they're going to
post on the web.

409
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,790
And on the web for quite
a while was the

410
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,470
slicing of his brain.

411
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:24,530
He consented to this, all this
research effort, and finally

412
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:27,850
his brain is a gift to research
and understanding the

413
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,100
brain and memory.

414
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:39,220

415
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,800
So let me tell you a couple of
experimental results from him,

416
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,270
and then you might think of
questions you have about what

417
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,290
a man like this is like, OK?

418
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:49,370
So we talked about last time
about that if you give a list

419
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,830
of words to people, and you try
to do it yourself, that

420
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,870
people remember the
first words best--

421
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,290
the primacy effect, a long-term
memory effect that's

422
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:59,150
not affected by adding a
few seconds of delay--

423
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,320
and a recency affect--

424
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,650
superior memory for the last few
words of the list that's

425
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:06,640
strongly affected by adding in
just 10 seconds of delay from

426
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,900
the last word until
you recall.

427
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,310
And this is done with other
amnesic patients, and not HM,

428
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,790
but a similar disorder.

429
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,710
You can see that their memory
is worse overall--

430
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:16,829
there, the dark line--

431
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:19,220
but they have some
benefit from the

432
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,680
beginning of the list and--

433
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,295
but it's small.

434
00:17:22,295 --> 00:17:24,040
It's not the same
as the control--

435
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,040
but they're completely normal,
completely normal for the last

436
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,450
two or three words.

437
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:31,430
So this is what we mean by
impaired long-term memory and

438
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,110
spared short-term memory.

439
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,830
But the short-term memory's
just moments.

440
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:37,500
But it's not just an impression
you have.

441
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,450
It's a scientific experiment
you can do.

442
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,170
Here's another--

443
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,110
we did this last time.

444
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:47,030
We said, if you read digits to
people and ask them to repeat

445
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:51,350
them back aloud, that we have a
limited short-term memory of

446
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,570
seven plus or minus two.

447
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:56,860
People get to about seven
or eight, typically.

448
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,870
So there's a mean test that's
given to look at something.

449
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,420
So here's what they do.

450
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,640
Imagine that you do this test,
and you were correct for two

451
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,360
digits, correct for three,
repeating them back after you

452
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:06,960
heard them.

453
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,930
Four, five, six, seven,
you did well.

454
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:13,410
And then you made mistakes at
eight, which would be very

455
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:16,670
typical for a human.

456
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:19,240
So your span, therefore,
is seven.

457
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,170
That's how much you can hold
in short-term memory.

458
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:24,090
It varies a little bit from
person to person.

459
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,670
And now they're going to do all
the rest of the experiment

460
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,610
at one beyond your span.

461
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,510
One beyond what you can do.

462
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,260
One beyond what your
short-term memory--

463
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,090
here's the limit of your
short-term memory.

464
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,770
Let's add one thing.

465
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:40,490
And one thing that we know helps
memory is repetition.

466
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,070
It's not the best way to learn
things, but it is a powerful

467
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,400
way to learn things.

468
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,680
So now they give the entire
experiment with eight digits

469
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,190
at a time for this person, one
beyond what you could report.

470
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,150
So they give you this, and
they give you this.

471
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:56,570
But they give you one boost,
which is every third one, it's

472
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,370
the same sequence over
and over again.

473
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,970
So some you hear once
and once only.

474
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,410
And one, you hear over
and over again.

475
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,580
Is that OK?

476
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,380
Now what would happen if you
think, if you hear eight

477
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,460
digits over and over again?

478
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,090
What would happen?

479
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,320
You know this in
your own life.

480
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,590
Your Social Security number,
telephone numbers, things--

481
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,330
what happens?

482
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,340
Can you learn eight digits
if you do it over and--?

483
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,240
Yeah.

484
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,020
It wouldn't be easy, but you
get it with repetition.

485
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,360
So here's what happens
in typical people.

486
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,380
Here's the repetition.

487
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,980
Here's how well they do for the

488
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,720
non-repeated super-span ones.

489
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,970
They never get that
good because they

490
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,470
basically can't do that.

491
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,510
Occasionally they get lucky,
but mostly not.

492
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:37,110
But the ones that repeat, they
get better and better.

493
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,790
So repetition is another way
to break the bounds of

494
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:43,480
short-term memory and register
something in long-term memory.

495
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,110
But in HM, they did this for
hundreds of trials, and he

496
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,890
never got better at the
repeated series.

497
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,880
So you could do endless
repetition with him, or it

498
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,870
could be personally important.

499
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,330
He wouldn't remember it.

500
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,500
So let me add one more
piece to the story.

501
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,460
If I talk to you and say, here
are the digits, tell that back

502
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,670
to me, that's an auditory-verbal
experiment.

503
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,690
So they're words, and
you're hearing them.

504
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,960
You can also test short-term
memory and long-term memory

505
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,870
using a visuo-spatial
test of blocks.

506
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:14,260
So you're seeing what the
examiner sees, with numbers on

507
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,490
the back of each of these.

508
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:19,700
The person taking the test
just sees these blocks as

509
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,180
black boxes without
any number.

510
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,930
You need that because you have
a piece of paper with numbers

511
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,830
on it that tell you
what to tap.

512
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,490
OK?

513
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:30,310
So when you give this test,
you might see five, seven,

514
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:33,190
eight, and you would tap with
your hand, five, seven, eight,

515
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,970
and the person would
tap that back.

516
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,640
And I can tell you what made me
pretty nervous when I gave

517
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,850
this test to a person
who had a long one?

518
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:43,170
Because I'd have to read the
numbers, practice it, and I'd

519
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,230
be desperately trying to get
eight my head, which I could

520
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,530
barely do, maybe.

521
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:49,400
Because I could tap eight back,
so if a person was--

522
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,300
and then we'd do
the same thing.

523
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:54,380
We'd say, if you can do eight,
we'll test you at nine and

524
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,690
repeat them.

525
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,410
And here's two findings,
and let's talk

526
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:58,530
about HM for a moment.

527
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:02,460
So one finding is now, in
patients now-- we're going to

528
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,720
switch one thing a little bit.

529
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,900
HM had the left and the right
hippocampus removed.

530
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,960
In these patients, they
had either the left

531
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,030
or the right removed.

532
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,510
Either the left or the right.

533
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:14,870
So here's what happens for
normal controls, for the

534
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,360
numbers that are beyond
their span.

535
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,780
Not too good, low performance,
but they benefit from

536
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,090
repetition.

537
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:23,050
Here's what happens for the
patients with left hippocampal

538
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,290
removals for the
auditory-verbal

539
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,540
things for the digits.

540
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:31,970

541
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:35,350
So they're good for immediate
memory for this stuff, but

542
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:38,190
they're terrible at developing
a long-term memory over here,

543
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,680
if it's verbal.

544
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,790
But the patients with
the right temporal

545
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:44,320
ones are just fine.

546
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,370
For spatial things, it's
exactly the opposite.

547
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,870
The group that's really impaired
are the patients with

548
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:52,060
a large right hippocampal
removal, and the people with

549
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,360
the left hippocampal
do just fine.

550
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,970
So we have two separations in
the brain for learning things

551
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,980
in the medial temporal lobes.

552
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,710
Neither the left nor the right
are involved in short-term

553
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:06,180
memory, short-term memory
lasting only seconds.

554
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:09,160
The left is important for verbal
long-term memories, and

555
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,840
the right is important for
long-term spatial memories,

556
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,390
which is very consistent with
what we know about left and

557
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:19,770
right hemispheres for verbal
and spatial knowledge.

558
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:25,300
So let me say a word more about
how we think about the

559
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,040
organization of memory, and
we'll come back to this chart.

560
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,040
So we're talking here, so far,
about what people call

561
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,160
declarative or explicit
memory.

562
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,160
You study some material,
you get tested on it.

563
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,710
What did you study?

564
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,430
And people sometimes make
a difference between

565
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,930
two kinds of things.

566
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:43,220
So episodic memory might
be if I ask you--

567
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,360
OK, I need a volunteer
in your seat.

568
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,760
It's really easy, this one.

569
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:54,580

570
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,340
OK, thanks.

571
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,830
I saw some people getting
ready to go.

572
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:59,630
Well, OK.

573
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:03,110
OK, what did you have for
breakfast this morning?

574
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,170
And you don't have to answer
honestly if its embarrassing.

575
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,740
You can just give
us a standard--

576
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,460
(LAUGHING) I'm not
looking to make--

577
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,580
yeah.

578
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,020
AUDIENCE: Cereal.

579
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:10,166
PROFESSOR: Cereal.

580
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:10,945
How about you?

581
00:23:10,945 --> 00:23:11,280
AUDIENCE: What?

582
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:11,890
AUDIENCE: Yogurt.

583
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,060
PROFESSOR: Yogurt.

584
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:12,680
Cereal and yogurt.

585
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,790
Two excellent healthy answers.

586
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,180
OK.

587
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:17,930
So now I'm going to ask you--

588
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:18,990
if I could ask you first.

589
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:22,080
How many feet in a yard?

590
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,060
AUDIENCE: Three.

591
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:23,840
PROFESSOR: Excellent.

592
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,710
OK.

593
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:27,260
And now I'm going to ask
you, when and where

594
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,870
did you learn that?

595
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:30,610
OK?

596
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:34,520
And you might go,
I don't know.

597
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,500
I just learned it.

598
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,360
Right?

599
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,220
Or if I ask you, capital
of France.

600
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:38,670
AUDIENCE: Paris.

601
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:39,130
PROFESSOR: Paris.

602
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:40,450
Excellent answer.

603
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:44,540
When was the shocking moment
when this was revealed to you?

604
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,600
When you said, I'll never
trust the world again--

605
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,380
yes.

606
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,250
Who knows, right?

607
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:51,040
So what you're learning is,
episodic memory is memory for

608
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,660
specific events, like what I did
last night, what I had for

609
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,880
breakfast, specific
time and place.

610
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,410
Semantic memory is what we could
call generic memory.

611
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:02,610
We know lots of things about
the world, but we might not

612
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,420
know when or where we learned.

613
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,220
So that's a distinction
psychologists find useful to

614
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,280
think about.

615
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,170
So how about in HM?

616
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:10,850
We said he can't remember
digits, or faces,

617
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:11,810
or things like that.

618
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:15,100
How about generic memory?

619
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:19,310
So here's an experiment that
I was involved in, where we

620
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,500
said-- because there
were some debates

621
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,700
about this at the time.

622
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,270
So we gave HM a multiple choice
test where he saw words

623
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:29,240
or phrases that entered the
language after the onset of

624
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,140
his amnesia.

625
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,300
So we thought he wouldn't learn
them, but we didn't know

626
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,450
for sure, from just everyday
experience.

627
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:36,530
And by the way, I should tell
you, he watched tons of

628
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:37,670
television.

629
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,710
What his experience was like
watching television is an

630
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,760
interesting question.

631
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,230
You should be thinking now about
questions you want to

632
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,510
ask about HM.

633
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,180
In a moment, I'll come
back to that.

634
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,430
But look at-- so, he has four
choices for the word

635
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:51,290
amniocentesis, including the
correct one, but he picks "an

636
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,110
infectious inflammatory
disease of the

637
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,630
intestines." apartheid?

638
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:57,455
In front of him is the correct
answer, two other answers, and

639
00:24:57,455 --> 00:25:00,010
he picks, "the separation of
young cows that have not yet

640
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:00,870
given birth to calves."

641
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:03,000
Boat people? "People who cater
bon voyage parties," which is

642
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,600
completely the wrong--

643
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,360
Brainwash, "a fluid that
surrounds and bathes the

644
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,190
brain." Granola, "a portable
keyboard wind instrument."

645
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,250
Software, "expensive clothing
made of a soft, twilled

646
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,990
fabric."

647
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,290
What's going on with him?

648
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:18,980
Are these, like, crazy
weird answers?

649
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,830
Or how would you-- what do we
think is going on with him?

650
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:22,750
Why is he picking these?

651
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,860
The other one is right
in front of him.

652
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,950
What's he doing?

653
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,380
AUDIENCE: Looking at
words he knows.

654
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,130
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

655
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,660
He's doing what teachers
teach you in school.

656
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,420
Take apart the word into
its parts, right?

657
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:37,680
And so he goes, software, soft
clothes that you wear.

658
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,540
But what does that mean?

659
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,850
He's missed, in every sense,
the advent of computers and

660
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,140
software in the world.

661
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,450
The idea, the concept,
the words--

662
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:49,230
it's as if it didn't exist,
because in 1953, although

663
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:52,050
software existed, it wasn't
a very popular concept.

664
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,110
Most people didn't know about
the concept of that.

665
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,600
In 1953--

666
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,800
the way we looked at these,
these were not words that were

667
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,690
in the dictionary
in the 1950s.

668
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:05,085
So now, what would you like to
know about a man like HM?

669
00:26:05,085 --> 00:26:08,055

670
00:26:08,055 --> 00:26:08,550
Yeah.

671
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:11,025
AUDIENCE: So obviously he
couldn't remember something

672
00:26:11,025 --> 00:26:13,747
that happened two hours ago,
but if you're having a

673
00:26:13,747 --> 00:26:16,717
conversation with him, would he
not remember what you guys

674
00:26:16,717 --> 00:26:17,460
were talking about?

675
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,430
Or could he remember the context
of the conversation?

676
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:20,710
PROFESSOR: Right.

677
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,380
So you're saying, he wouldn't
remember something two days

678
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,300
ago, but you're talking
with him.

679
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:23,870
What's that like?

680
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,500
Right?

681
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,650
So let me give you
one experimental

682
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:27,410
thing and then an exper--

683
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:29,310
so one experiment they did is
they left him with something

684
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:32,650
like six numbers, well within
the span, and said, remember

685
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:33,850
these numbers.

686
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:37,210
And it could be, you know, 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6-- well, that

687
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,910
wouldn't work so well.

688
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,330
2, 4, 6, 8, 9.

689
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:40,840
2, 4, 6, 8, 9.

690
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,080
They leave the room
for 15 minutes.

691
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:42,650
They come back in.

692
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,020
He's an excellent subject.

693
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:44,950
He's going, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9.

694
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,030
2, 4, 6, 8, 9.

695
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:46,200
What were the numbers?

696
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,840
2, 4, 6, 8, 9.

697
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,480
They go, that's excellent.

698
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,880
Was there any trick you
did to do that?

699
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,400
Or did you just--

700
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,540
And he'd go, oh, oh, oh.

701
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,670
What were the numbers?

702
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:56,220
As soon as a thought is out
of the forefront of

703
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,390
his mind, it's gone.

704
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,590
So, yeah.

705
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:03,950
He would not recognize us, and
we spent many hours with him.

706
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:06,080
A striking thing, which was
amazing at first and then

707
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,040
sometimes irksome if you worked
with him-- and he was a

708
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,410
delightful guy--

709
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:11,660
was that he would tell you
a story from his past.

710
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,455
And he didn't have a huge array
of stories, because they

711
00:27:13,455 --> 00:27:16,180
were all from a long time ago.

712
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,250
And he would tell you about
a gun collection he had.

713
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,090
And he would tell he had three
guns, and they had this

714
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,110
property and that property.

715
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:24,180
He'd finish the story, and if
you just stayed quiet for a

716
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:28,080
moment, he would forget that he
told you the story, but it

717
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,130
would be vaguely on his
mind because he

718
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:31,390
just told it to you.

719
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,200
And he would say to you, hey,
did I tell you about my gun

720
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:33,850
collection?

721
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:36,730
And he would tell you, almost
verbatim, the same story.

722
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:37,840
You'd just wait a moment.

723
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,790
He forgot that he told you this
story, but it's slightly

724
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,080
on his mind because you
just told you it.

725
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,300
And he goes, hey, did
I tell you my--

726
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:47,610
he could tell you this until you
could bear it no longer.

727
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:50,140
So it was kind of amazing
how short his

728
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,400
short-term memory was.

729
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,740
Without this part of the brain,

730
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,620
it's just a few seconds.

731
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:57,200
His conversations were
OK, but I would

732
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,240
call them pretty shallow.

733
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,050
I don't know how to put it.

734
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,410
You know, when you talk with
somebody and you're on the

735
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:03,900
phone, and they're
doing something

736
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,970
else, and you can tell--

737
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:06,900
for him it was a little
bit like that.

738
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,195
He was-- so, good social
convention.

739
00:28:08,195 --> 00:28:09,080
He would smile.

740
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,170
He would chat with you.

741
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:12,520
But if what you were talking
about depended on remembering

742
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,750
something from three sentences
ago in any detail, gone.

743
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:18,510
Just seconds, unless he's
practicing and practicing and

744
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,960
practicing without doing
anything else.

745
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,190
Yeah.

746
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:22,640
AUDIENCE: So he did have
the capability to learn

747
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,490
procedurally.

748
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:23,850
PROFESSOR: Yes.

749
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:24,550
We're going to come to that.

750
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,510
So the question is, did he
ever learn-- he had other

751
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,320
kinds of learning that
were amazingly

752
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,600
completely normal in him.

753
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,870
Procedural memory, you're
absolutely right.

754
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,590
And we'll come to that just
in about 20 minutes, OK?

755
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,480
Exactly right.

756
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,700
And if I don't answer that well,
make me do that again.

757
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,250
OK?

758
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:37,800
But yeah.

759
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,094
Yeah?

760
00:28:39,094 --> 00:28:40,942
AUDIENCE: Was he able to
remember that he couldn't

761
00:28:40,942 --> 00:28:41,870
remember things?

762
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:42,130
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

763
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:42,740
Really good question.

764
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,990
Was he able to remember that he
couldn't remember things?

765
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,480
Yes, he knew he had
a bad memory.

766
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,310
So now the question is, in what
sense did he know he had

767
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,530
a bad memory?

768
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:55,060
Like, I know I can't draw very
well, amongst many other

769
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,200
things I can't do very well.

770
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,790
But if you talked to him,
he'd say, yeah, I

771
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:00,990
don't have a good memory.

772
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,800
But he's looking at you, and
he's going, like, I don't know

773
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,580
where I am, who you are,
or what I'm doing.

774
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,660
Everything is vague, for
many, many years.

775
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,810
I must have bad memory.

776
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,750
Like, you would too, like
a science fiction movie.

777
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,500
You woke up, you didn't know who
you were, where you were,

778
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,870
what you were doing, and you
can't remember anything except

779
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:16,850
from the most distant past.

780
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,800
You'd go, something is not
good with my memory.

781
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,670
But you're smart, so you
would know that.

782
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:23,030
What I don't know is if you woke
him up at 2 AM and you

783
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:25,510
said, HM, how's your memory?

784
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,940
I don't know if he'd go, well,
I'm a famous amnesic, of

785
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,620
course it's terrible.

786
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:32,240
I don't know if he knew it as
a fact, like we might know

787
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,740
about what we're good and not
good at, or he just knew it by

788
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,690
constantly being aware that he
didn't know anything he ought

789
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,860
to know via memory.

790
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,580
Does that make sense?

791
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,870
Anything else about--?

792
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:44,210
Yeah.

793
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:47,870
AUDIENCE: How does one explain
scientific consent to--?

794
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:48,290
PROFESSOR: Oh, this is good.

795
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:49,310
It's a very interesting
question.

796
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:51,750
Informed consent.

797
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:55,800
So technically he was conserved
by the state once

798
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,790
his family had passed away.

799
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,380
But, you know, his intelligence
was fine, so you

800
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,130
had to be a little bit careful
to do it right.

801
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,760
But you could tell him, we're
going to do an experiment.

802
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,860
We're going to test your
memory for words.

803
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,730
Is that OK with you?

804
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:06,370
And he'd say yes.

805
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,320
Of course, if you had him read
a 12-page document, by the

806
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,220
time he got to page 12-- but you
could talk him through it.

807
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,895
His intelligence was fine.

808
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:14,530
You could worry about the
edges, if there--

809
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:18,920
so I think the investigators
felt an extra ethical thing,

810
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,940
also, not to ask him to do
anything that a person

811
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,880
might say no to.

812
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,825
He was a wonderful participant,
but it was an

813
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:27,846
extra responsibility for the
reason you're saying.

814
00:30:27,846 --> 00:30:31,550
AUDIENCE: Does that mean he
was happy all the time?

815
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,630
PROFESSOR: Was he happy
all the time?

816
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:33,620
Excellent question.

817
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,650
He was a very sort of mellow--

818
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:36,920
yeah.

819
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,180
Well, you could think for a
moment whether having no

820
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,480
memory would make you
happy or sad.

821
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,100
So he couldn't hold a job.

822
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,060
He couldn't sustain a human
relation because he would

823
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,310
never know he'd met
you before.

824
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:47,220

825
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,680
So, those are things we often
think of as pretty big in our

826
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,790
happiness, the kind of the
work we do, in some broad

827
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:54,250
sense, and the people
we relate to, right?

828
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,640
And those were all
gone for him.

829
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,410
On the other hand, he didn't
exactly realize that.

830
00:30:58,410 --> 00:30:59,420
He didn't realize
he didn't work.

831
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,460
He didn't realize he didn't
have relations he might be

832
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,440
expected to have, because he'd
forget that about as fast as

833
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,840
he could think about it.

834
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,180
So I--

835
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:12,770
he was kind of a very, I would
say, mild, happy person.

836
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:15,350
So there's three possibilities
that crossed my head.

837
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:17,020
And scientifically, we can
never figure them out.

838
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:21,320
One of them is, maybe just
he was that way.

839
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,610
I mean some people are just
mellow and happy, right?

840
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:26,200
They don't have--
without amnesia.

841
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,860
Second possibility is-- he had
removed, also, the amygdala.

842
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,930
We'll talk about that
later in the course.

843
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:34,070
That's a structure that's pretty
important for some

844
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,990
aspects of emotion
and feeling.

845
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,950
So that could have
been relevant.

846
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:39,760
The third one is, but this is
kind of getting to your

847
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,700
question, which was just--

848
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,930
intuitively, I feel like this.

849
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:45,590
Again, this is not science
but is just a feeling.

850
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:50,030
That what makes us mostly
sort of happy or sad?

851
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:53,840
For me, it's mostly relatively
recent things that went well

852
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,400
or didn't go well, or things
I'm sad about recently, and

853
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,500
things on my horizon.

854
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,030
Things I'm worried about, or
things I'm looking forward to.

855
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:05,030
And you guys might be different,
but I don't get

856
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:07,490
that worked up these days
about second grade.

857
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:10,170
At the time I'm sure it was
pretty emotional about it.

858
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:13,820
So if you think about him, he
doesn't remember anything

859
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,560
recent that was good or bad.

860
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:20,180
He doesn't remember anything
coming up that's interesting,

861
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:23,020
or threatening, or risky,
or unpleasant.

862
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,800
So he lives in this
constant now.

863
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,670
You know, people tell you,
live in the moment.

864
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:29,820
Nobody could have lived more
in the moment than he did.

865
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:32,530
It's impossible to live more
in the moment when the

866
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:34,050
previous moment you can
consult is from

867
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:36,140
30, 40 years ago.

868
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:39,650
So, yeah, he was pretty happy,
and a pretty pleasant guy.

869
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,400
Essentially, I don't think most
of us want that life,

870
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,180
although he's probably happier
than many people who have all

871
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,220
their memories.

872
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:48,110
One thing he's the opposite
of, just to remind you--

873
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,730
we talked about it now, but just
to make it clear-- it's

874
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:51,460
the opposite of television
amnesia.

875
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:56,010
What happens in soap operas and
murder movies or comedy

876
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,460
shows when they get bonked
on the head?

877
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,310

878
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,840
Television amnesia.

879
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,850
They forget who they are and
where they came from, right?

880
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,820
And then they marry their worst
enemy or something like

881
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,800
this, to make the story
go forward.

882
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,800
That's television amnesia.

883
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,650
But after that, they're
kind of fine, right?

884
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,380
They're kind of operating
but they just

885
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,560
forgot where they come--

886
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,350
that we never see after
brain injuries.

887
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:24,520
We never see a person who
forgets who they are but gets

888
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,260
around fine in the world.

889
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,210
HM is the opposite.

890
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:29,560
He remembers stuff from
before, but he

891
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,440
can't learn new things.

892
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,690
Opposite of TV amnesia.

893
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:33,950

894
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,280
Any other questions about HM?

895
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,698
Yeah.

896
00:33:36,698 --> 00:33:38,634
AUDIENCE: As he got older,
could he recognize

897
00:33:38,634 --> 00:33:41,540
people from his past?

898
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,230
AUDIENCE: Yes, and let me talk
a little bit about that.

899
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,060
If I don't answer that,
let me know.

900
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,080
So let me talk about this.

901
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,160
This sort of touches on this,
loss of already-known

902
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,080
information.

903
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,310
And if I don't answer you
well, just put your

904
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:53,550
hand up again, OK?

905
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:56,780
So it's easy to test learning
new things, because you can

906
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,410
give somebody something in the
laboratory and you see

907
00:33:58,410 --> 00:33:59,420
if they learn it.

908
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,790
Knowing things they should
have known from

909
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,090
before is much harder.

910
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:05,430
Different people know different
things, in the past.

911
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,660
So here's how they'd test it.

912
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:10,630
And here's a thing that people
have discovered, which is

913
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:14,989
people are pretty
unknowledgeable, mostly, about

914
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:17,550
faces of people who
were famous at the

915
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,659
time they were famous.

916
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:20,929
But if you're, like, 20, you
don't know people who were

917
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:21,929
famous before you were born.

918
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:22,600
Mostly.

919
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,690
There's some exceptions.

920
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:28,210
So they'd take faces from
different decades, and they'd

921
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:30,510
show you them and they'd ask
you, do you know who this is?

922
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,800
So do you know who this is?

923
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,050
This is Lindbergh.

924
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:36,370

925
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:37,620
Frank Sinatra.

926
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,699

927
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:40,330
Bob Hope.

928
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,679
Does that name even
ring a bell?

929
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,639
I know.

930
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,750
This is totally--

931
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:49,330
however old you are is totally
how you do on this test.

932
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:51,002
Lyndon Baines Johnson, president
of the United States

933
00:34:51,002 --> 00:34:53,780
after Kennedy.

934
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:56,989
Douglas MacArthur,
the general.

935
00:34:56,989 --> 00:34:58,090
This, you might.

936
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:59,340
Richard Nixon.

937
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:02,910

938
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:06,590
McCarthy, as in McCarthyism.

939
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,610
Golda Meir.

940
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:10,275
Elvis.

941
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,920
OK now.

942
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,790
If you--

943
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,270
pretend you became amnesic.

944
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:16,210
You became amnesic.

945
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:19,320
Pretend you're old enough to
become amnesic in 1990.

946
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,520
This is if you're feeling--

947
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,490
would you know this
face, in 1990?

948
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:25,360
Let's say 1980.

949
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,430
Let's make it simple.

950
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,170
1980?

951
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,280
No.

952
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,956
Would you know this face?

953
00:35:29,956 --> 00:35:30,850
No.

954
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:31,160
OK.

955
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,630
But you know them now.

956
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:37,260
So that tells you that you can
put faces to decades, roughly.

957
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:41,000
You know, 1980, only Barack
Obama's family knew Barack

958
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,760
Obama's face, right?

959
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,010
And now we all do.

960
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:45,410

961
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,000
Temporally limited retrograde
amnesia.

962
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,400
So this is how well you do--
higher is better--

963
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,380
in decades.

964
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,110
In 1960, here's HM.

965
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:55,160
So here's faces that were famous
in the '20s, '30s, and

966
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,800
'40s, before he became amnesic,

967
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,120
and he's pretty normal.

968
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,670
These are public faces.

969
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,610
And then he's terrible
for the '50s and

970
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:04,840
'60s, after his amnesia.

971
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:09,390
So his memory for faces from
the past is pretty normal.

972
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,820
His memory for faces from the
onset of his amnesia forward

973
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,720
is terrible.

974
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,430
Is that OK?

975
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,725
Does that answer your
question reasonably?

976
00:36:14,725 --> 00:36:17,490

977
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:19,640
But here's another really
weird thing that people

978
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,260
observed in many cases, which is
kind of hard to understand,

979
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,800
but it's been observed
in many cases.

980
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,470
So here's another patient.

981
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,590
He was a bus driver
in Washington, DC.

982
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,850
He moved to work in a drugstore
in Boston, then a

983
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:32,480
mattress factory in Boston.

984
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,460
Then he was hospitalized at the
Boston VA in November 1965

985
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,685
with a huge hematoma on the
right temporal parietal-- a

986
00:36:38,685 --> 00:36:40,010
big bleeding.

987
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:41,970
And he was pretty aphasic
and stuporous.

988
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:43,750
He couldn't answer questions.

989
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:47,370
In a month, digit span, his
short-term memory returns.

990
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:52,050
He states the date as
approximately something like

991
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:54,580
September 1965.

992
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,130
He has a severe anterograde
amnesia.

993
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,770
For example, he fails to learned
the names of the

994
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:00,550
nurses he sees every day.

995
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:03,120
But when asked-- this is
the striking thing.

996
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,760
When asked, where do you live?

997
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,150
He says, I live in Washington,
with certainty, as if he lost

998
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:10,600
all these memories
from before.

999
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,310
By March, he starts to learn
the nurses' names.

1000
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:15,640
He's recovering his
memory capacity.

1001
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:18,330
He couldn't remember that he'd
moved to Boston, but he

1002
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:20,840
doesn't fight the idea that
he lives in Boston.

1003
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,870
Then he remembers that he
worked at a drugstore.

1004
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,740
Then he remembers that he worked
in a mattress factory.

1005
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,840
And by the time that he's
discharged, it's only the last

1006
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,750
24 hours before he went into the
hospital that he's lost.

1007
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:30,730
So two things.

1008
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:33,640
There's a coupling between the
anterograde amnesia and the

1009
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,600
retrograde amnesia.

1010
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,930
He can't learn new things,
but he lost old things.

1011
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:40,550
And as the anterograde amnesia
resolves, the retrograde

1012
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:43,460
amnesia resolves, in some sense,
in temporal order.

1013
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:47,840
It's really odd, but it's been
observed many times.

1014
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,480
So there is some link between
what the hippocampus does and

1015
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,730
memory for the past.

1016
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:58,010
Now in some ways, it's really
hard to study these things in

1017
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:59,670
detail in a patient like HM.

1018
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,530
But some other patients give
us another perspective.

1019
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:04,330
Although every one of these
examples is not quite perfect.

1020
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:07,180
Here's patients who undergo
treatment for depression with

1021
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,470
electroconvulsive therapy.

1022
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,870
And appropriately--

1023
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:13,510
in movies like One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest, wrongly

1024
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:16,340
used electroconvulsive
therapy is wrong.

1025
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:19,310
For some patients with severe
depression who fail to respond

1026
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:22,210
to medications and who have
suicidal ideation--

1027
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:24,060
literally attempt to take their
lives or talk a lot

1028
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:27,320
about it in a believable way
to family and physician--

1029
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,740
electroconvulsive therapy
can be very helpful.

1030
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,710
It's a hard choice to make,
and a complicated one.

1031
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,330
Here's what happens.

1032
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:35,650
Patients typically go-- and it
varies-- but they go in for

1033
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:38,040
the electroconvulsive therapy.

1034
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,790
And nowadays, it's done,
typically, only in the right

1035
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:40,270
hemisphere.

1036
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,350
In this study, done some
years ago around

1037
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:44,670
1972, it was bilateral.

1038
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:46,270
They put electrodes on both
sides of the brain.

1039
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:50,800
They passed current and they
induced a seizure.

1040
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,590
And they do that something
like every second day for

1041
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,520
about 10 days.

1042
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,460
It's a very aggressive form
of treatment, certainly.

1043
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,460
But for some patients, the
depression just lifts, and

1044
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,040
they're no longer talking about
taking their lives.

1045
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:06,140
So for some people it seems to
work when other things don't.

1046
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,700
During the course of the
treatment, these patients

1047
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,700
develop and anterograde
amnesia.

1048
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,790
They become HM-like.

1049
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,990
While they're in the hospital,
they become HM-like.

1050
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,600
They can't learn new things.

1051
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,560
They forget the nurses.

1052
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,290
You can test them formally.

1053
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:20,710
And so Larry Squire did the
following experiment with

1054
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,910
these kinds of patients.

1055
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:24,800
So we don't know that it's the
hippocampus that's the

1056
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,410
critical thing in these
patients, but they

1057
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:28,740
look a lot like HM.

1058
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,850
And we know that the
hippocampus has

1059
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,530
a low seizure threshold.

1060
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:36,160
That's why it occurs so often
as the locus of epilepsy.

1061
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,950
So what they did is they
took television shows.

1062
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:41,020
And this is another world than
you can possibly imagine.

1063
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:43,590
I grew up in a world where there
were basically three

1064
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,710
television stations.

1065
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,670
And you're feeling sad for
me already, right?

1066
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,690
And so everybody knew
what was on those

1067
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:51,160
three television stations.

1068
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,990
But they took shows that weren't
very successful, that

1069
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,900
were on for one season only.

1070
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,320
So they weren't super popular,
but a lot of people saw them.

1071
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,250
And there were only
three television

1072
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:01,270
networks and stations.

1073
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:04,290
So now what they did is they
tested them on these events or

1074
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:07,410
other things like that before
they had ECT-- so this is

1075
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:08,780
their knowledge before
they had ECT.

1076
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:12,930
Of course they remember recent
things, 1971, better than

1077
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:14,840
stuff from years ago.

1078
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,060
We all do.

1079
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:19,000
But the striking thing is that
when these patients got ECT,

1080
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,610
during the course of their
amnesia they only lost memory

1081
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:24,940
for TV shows from the
last two years.

1082
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,010
They didn't lose
those memories.

1083
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:27,130
These are the very
same patients.

1084
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:30,780
The very same patients before
they got ECT and while they're

1085
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:35,090
getting ECT, they lose memory
only for the last two years of

1086
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:36,690
TV shows and not all
the other ones.

1087
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:39,850
Or the same thing you can do
with famous public events.

1088
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:41,440
So this is what people call a

1089
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,425
temporally-limited retrograde amnesia.

1090
00:40:43,425 --> 00:40:46,640
It goes back for some years, the
knowledge you already had.

1091
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,550
And here's the amazing thing.

1092
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,560
When these patients go home,
their memory largely comes

1093
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,410
back and so does their knowledge
of the TV shows.

1094
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,030
It's as if it's in
their brain.

1095
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:57,580
They don't have access to it,
for the last two years of

1096
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,540
information.

1097
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:03,290
But it's still sitting there and
they regain that access.

1098
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:05,400
Two more examples on this.

1099
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,110
So here's an example--

1100
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,620
because with humans
it's always tough.

1101
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,120
So they do the same thing
with monkeys.

1102
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,180
With monkeys, they could create
a surgical lesion like

1103
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,230
HM and train them on material.

1104
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:17,070
They knew exactly what
they learned.

1105
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:19,940
Here they had the surgery
either 2, 4, 8 or

1106
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,940
12, or 8, 16 weeks.

1107
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,630
And you can see the monkeys with
the hippocampal damage

1108
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:28,090
were performing poorly if they
learned the material 2 or 4

1109
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:33,400
weeks ago but not 8
or 16 weeks ago.

1110
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,540
Again, a temporally-limited
retrograde amnesia.

1111
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:39,000
So we're getting the idea that
the hippocampus is important,

1112
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,350
not only for forming
new memories--

1113
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:42,980
and this is kind of wild.

1114
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:45,590
It's still important for you to
remember stuff from a week

1115
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:48,280
ago, a month ago, and
a couple years ago.

1116
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:52,060
And it takes years for your
memory to become independent,

1117
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:54,510
or what people call
consolidated, so that it no

1118
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:58,280
longer depends upon
the hippocampus.

1119
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,960
So the hippocampus both is
required to form a new memory,

1120
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,070
and it seems like it's necessary
to remember that

1121
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:06,810
memory from months to years,
before that memory becomes

1122
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:08,380
independent of the
hippocampus.

1123
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:12,770
So right now in you, it's as
if you had a neurochemistry

1124
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:17,960
team finishing your memories
from the end of eighth grade.

1125
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,600
We're done.

1126
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,970
We're moving on to
ninth grade!

1127
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:24,340
Because it takes years for your
hippocampus to no longer

1128
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:27,480
be required to get those
memories that you

1129
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,010
acquired years ago.

1130
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:31,070
And the same thing-- they did
these famous faces, like the

1131
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:32,100
ones I showed you before?

1132
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,960
So these had to be somewhat
older people.

1133
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,640
Here's activation in the 1990s,
if they were looking at

1134
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,880
famous faces and the experiment
was done in the

1135
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,670
late 1990s.

1136
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:44,110
So recent faces, hippocampus
turned on, but not for '80s,

1137
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:46,040
'70s, or '60s, or
'50s, or '40s.

1138
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,810
Again, they said the hippocampus
is required to

1139
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:51,260
retrieve memories that's in
the rest of your brain for

1140
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:54,400
some time period, but then after
much time passes, it's

1141
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,670
no longer required.

1142
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:57,630
So this just summarizes
those things.

1143
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:59,560
So now, Tyler, if we
could do the film.

1144
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,170
We're going to how you
an amnesic patient.

1145
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:04,460
Most amnesic patients
are like this man.

1146
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,570
Very intelligent, very verbal.

1147
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:10,280
Not dramatic, but with terribly
impaired memory.

1148
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:21,100

1149
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:24,510
So last part of the talk is this
idea of memory systems

1150
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:27,250
and procedural memory, the idea
that you're a symphony of

1151
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:28,880
the neural systems that learn
different things.

1152
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,620
So your brain is like the
university, right?

1153
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,800
Department of Chemistry,
department of Biology,

1154
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,570
department of Brain and

1155
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,130
Cognitive Science, or Economics.

1156
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:39,770
In you are multiple very
specialized learning circuits

1157
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:41,530
that are good for learning
different things.

1158
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:43,640
So this idea of a memory system,
a particular part of

1159
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:47,690
the brain that has a particular
learning process.

1160
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:50,180
And a key concept in that is,
so far we've been talking

1161
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:52,340
about what people would
normally call memory--

1162
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:53,710
explicit or direct testing.

1163
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:55,530
You know, what did you study?

1164
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:56,200
What year is it?

1165
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,060
You're asked directly
to do something.

1166
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:01,310
But another way to show memory
and learning is through

1167
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:05,220
changes in performance
with practice.

1168
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,460
So people will sometimes call
the first kind declarative

1169
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:10,200
memory, where you directly have
conscious memory about

1170
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,190
facts and episodes.

1171
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,260
You know that you know
something, or

1172
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,890
that something occurred.

1173
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:16,680
And then the other kind, we'll
talk about now, procedural

1174
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:19,350
memory, accessible only through
performance and

1175
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:21,420
knowing how.

1176
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,480
Now with these kinds of skill
learning or procedural memory,

1177
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,900
we see how people get better
when they practice.

1178
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:28,830
Getting better is a change in
your behavior that's learned

1179
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:30,085
and a change in your brain
that performs.

1180
00:44:30,085 --> 00:44:32,010
This is for your performance.

1181
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:34,710
So here's the experiment that
was the original one Brenda

1182
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:36,970
Milner did with HM,
where you have to

1183
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:38,670
trace a star in a mirror.

1184
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:41,230
You see your hand in a mirror,
but you don't have direct view

1185
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:42,000
of your hand.

1186
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,125
Have any of you done something
like this for some odds and

1187
00:44:44,125 --> 00:44:45,060
ends reason?

1188
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:45,440
Anybody?

1189
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,480
Sometimes--

1190
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,350
do I see a hand?

1191
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:49,750
No.

1192
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:50,750
OK.

1193
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:51,940
It's surprisingly hard.

1194
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,830
The horizontals and verticals
are pretty easy.

1195
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:55,970
The diagonals, as you
move your hand, you

1196
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:56,920
go, oh, it's no problem.

1197
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,730
I just reverse everything.

1198
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:01,540
And you see your hand just
drift the wrong way.

1199
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,740
And you go, OK, no,
no, no, no.

1200
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:06,350
I just have to go 45
degrees difference.

1201
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:07,080
I can do it.

1202
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,340
And you're controlling your
hand, but then you move again

1203
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,420
and it still goes
the wrong way.

1204
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,970
And so at first, you make
lots of mistakes.

1205
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:16,550
We understand this because you
have such automaticity between

1206
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:19,030
what you see and how you move
all the time, that the mirror

1207
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:21,860
reverse, you have to overcome
that automatic relationship.

1208
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:24,410
So at first you make a lot of
mistakes and move slowly.

1209
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:26,000
You practice, and
you get better.

1210
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,800
Here's the remarkable thing
with-- so here's HM.

1211
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,700
Each of these dots is the next
time he does it consecutively.

1212
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,580
He gets better from doing
it over and over again.

1213
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,390
That's not a shock.

1214
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:36,850
Here's the shock.

1215
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:39,565
He comes the next day, he keeps
the learning he had and

1216
00:45:39,565 --> 00:45:40,150
he gets better.

1217
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:42,510
He comes in day three,
he keeps learning.

1218
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:46,180
Now for him, a day is like
infinity, for memory.

1219
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:48,270
When he comes in the room, he
says, what do I do with this?

1220
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:49,800
You'd go, well, we did
it the last two days.

1221
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:50,230
Don't you know?

1222
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:52,050
He said, no, I have no idea.

1223
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,050
Have you done this before?

1224
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:53,540
No.

1225
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:55,310
You can give him multiple choice
of different things he

1226
00:45:55,310 --> 00:45:55,770
might have done.

1227
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:57,050
He'll pick the wrong thing.

1228
00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:59,600
When you come in on day three
and you're this good, you're

1229
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,280
pretty proud.

1230
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,220
In fact, vain.

1231
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:02,180
You're going, like,
I can do this.

1232
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:02,970
I'm awesome.

1233
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:04,560
Just let me at it.

1234
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,110
Because you know that
you did it.

1235
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:07,890
You know how good you are
through practice.

1236
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:11,180
He has no idea, but his learning
is entirely normal.

1237
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:13,290
Not just better than
you'd think?

1238
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:15,240
Just as good as you.

1239
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,610
So a memory system in his brain,
different than the

1240
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:22,600
hippocampus, has kept that
memory, uses that memory.

1241
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,670
And the amazing thing is that
this means that that's also

1242
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:27,090
true in you, as far as we
understand these things.

1243
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:30,570
When you learn a physical or
mental skill, a lot of it is

1244
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:34,690
learned in a way that has
nothing to do with your memory

1245
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:35,800
that you learned the skill.

1246
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,560
It's all by doing.

1247
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,470
And it doesn't depend
on the hippocampus.

1248
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:42,730
And some years later, I did
this again a little bit.

1249
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:46,390
Here's his performance first,
second, third day, a week

1250
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:48,530
later, two weeks later,
and a year later.

1251
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:52,580
Complete retention for a man who
can forget within moments.

1252
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,820
A year later, a skill.

1253
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:57,770
He forgets that he did it
ever within moments.

1254
00:46:57,770 --> 00:47:01,215
So another kind of task that
people do-- same idea.

1255
00:47:01,215 --> 00:47:03,710
A motor skill you can lose, it's
called rotary pursuit.

1256
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:06,080
There's a disc like this that
revolves around a platter that

1257
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,600
turns pretty fast.

1258
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,360
Your job is to maintain
contact between--

1259
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,100
this was sort of sad before
video games, right?

1260
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:16,490
This is about as interesting
as 1940s games got.

1261
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:19,250
It was whizzed around, and it's
fast enough that it's not

1262
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:19,750
easy to do.

1263
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:21,550
And at first your hand goes off
it, but with practice you

1264
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:25,060
get really good at revolving
with a rotating disc.

1265
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:29,330
And HM and patients like him
learned that very well.

1266
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:30,460
Another motor skill.

1267
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:32,210
So who's bad at learning this?

1268
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:34,620
Which part of the brain is your
instrument for learning

1269
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:36,350
skills through practice?

1270
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:38,280
So our best evidence comes
from patients with a very

1271
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,090
difficult disease called
Huntington's disease.

1272
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:42,030
It's a genetic rare disease.

1273
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:44,190
Its onset is in the
30s or 40s.

1274
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:46,760
These patients get severe motor
problems and movement

1275
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,380
problems, and then, over
time, cognitive ones

1276
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:52,120
and psychiatric ones.

1277
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,470
There's no treatment for it.

1278
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:57,240
So this is the caudate withering
away in a patient

1279
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,140
with Huntington's disease
compared to a healthy

1280
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:00,670
person's, post mortem.

1281
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:05,240
Or if you look at an MRI, here's
your basal ganglia.

1282
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,850
Here's the withered away basal
ganglia in the patients with

1283
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:09,310
Huntington's disease.

1284
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:11,290
And there's a brief--

1285
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:14,920
can we do, Tyler-- there's a
brief video of a patient with

1286
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,280
early-stage Huntington's
disease.

1287
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:26,740

1288
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:30,190
So it's not the most severe
problem they have, but when

1289
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:32,490
they do one of these motor
kinds of tasks--

1290
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:35,460
here's normal typical people
learning a motor task, getting

1291
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:36,020
better on it.

1292
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:37,640
It's good to be high
on this graph.

1293
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,285
Here's the patients with
Huntington's disease showing

1294
00:48:39,285 --> 00:48:40,060
no learning at all.

1295
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:41,460
And this is a test
that an amnesic

1296
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,220
patient would learn normally.

1297
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,160
So very convincing-- and you
could say, well, if they have

1298
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,620
a motor problem, they're not
going to get a motor skill.

1299
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:51,700
So one thing they do is they
make the platter turn very

1300
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:54,580
slowly, so at the beginning
they're doing just as well.

1301
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,440
And they still show no
learning at all.

1302
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:59,330
So there's a lot of other
evidence sparked by this that

1303
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:02,320
just shows that the basal
ganglia is an instrument

1304
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:06,000
that's essential for us to
learn physical or motor

1305
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,220
skills, perceptual skills,
and a variety of

1306
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:09,740
cognitive skills as well.

1307
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:11,820
Things where we practice,
practice, practice to become

1308
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:12,670
excellent--

1309
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:16,080
basal ganglia is doing a lot
of that work for you.

1310
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,270
The last kind of learning I'll
talk to you about, and the

1311
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:21,920
last disease, is a sort of odder
form of learning called

1312
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,760
repetition priming.

1313
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,520
It's a change in performance
because of

1314
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,160
something you did recently.

1315
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,610
And if I give you a concrete
example, it'll feel better.

1316
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:34,230
So here's one of
many examples.

1317
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:37,050
Imagine you study a list of
words like stamp, landmark,

1318
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:37,760
speak, clock.

1319
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,030
You study a list of
words like these.

1320
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:41,390
I can give you an explicit or
declarative memory test.

1321
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:42,630
What words did you see?

1322
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:43,430
You'd recall them.

1323
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:45,960
Or which word did you see, that
we'd do multiple choice.

1324
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,420
That's regular memory that
we know depends on the

1325
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:49,710
hippocampus.

1326
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:52,370
I can also give you weird test
like this, which says, tell me

1327
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:55,210
the first word you think of
that starts with STA.

1328
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:57,000
Now if you have good memory,
you'll go, do you want me to

1329
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,270
give you stamp?

1330
00:49:58,270 --> 00:49:59,050
Is that the point?

1331
00:49:59,050 --> 00:49:59,940
And you go, no, no, no.

1332
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:01,380
And they go, oh, it's
a Freudian thing.

1333
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,480
You want to know some weird
things I'm gonna think of.

1334
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,340
And you go, no, no, no.

1335
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:06,630
Just tell me the first word
you think of, OK?

1336
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:08,850
And you can give many answers
that are all perfectly fine.

1337
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:11,950
You can give stall, stand,
staccato, star, many STA

1338
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:14,070
words, and all of
them are fine.

1339
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:15,090
That's all you have to do.

1340
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:18,360
But if you saw stamp, one
particular completion of this,

1341
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:22,240
about 10 minutes ago, you're
biased or primed to come up

1342
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:22,790
with that word.

1343
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:25,760
Not all the time, but much
more than by chance.

1344
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,840
A recent experience biases you
to behave in a certain way.

1345
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:30,990
And here's the remarkable
thing.

1346
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:35,230
When you do this experiment with
HM, if you just had the

1347
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:37,150
list of words and you
wait about 20

1348
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:38,660
seconds, here's your recall.

1349
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,970
Now you're not surprised that
recall from a healthy person

1350
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:42,190
is about seven words, right?

1351
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:43,280
You tried that yourself.

1352
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,350
HM, sadly, has no score
because he always

1353
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:46,840
goes, like, what list?

1354
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,050
So no recall.

1355
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:51,670
Multiple choice recognition,
where there are three choices,

1356
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:55,000
here's typical people,
HM about chance.

1357
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,270
The probability above chance--

1358
00:50:57,270 --> 00:51:00,100
that you give stamp as
the completion to

1359
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,160
STA if you saw stamp--

1360
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,550
if I showed you star, probably
you'd give star.

1361
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:07,240
The specific word you
saw 10 minutes ago?

1362
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:10,660
Perfectly the same in HM as
normal control subjects.

1363
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:14,550
He was just as influenced by
that word he saw 10 minutes

1364
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:18,310
ago as you are, to give
you that answer.

1365
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:20,710
So this got people very excited,
because they said,

1366
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:23,370
now we can experimentally and
scientifically study something

1367
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:27,640
that Freud talked about as a
very vague idea, the cognitive

1368
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:28,350
unconscious.

1369
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:31,760
He's not conscious that he saw
a list of words 10 minutes

1370
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,700
ago, but it's making him
choose to behave in

1371
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,870
a certain way now.

1372
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:38,700
Now you have both things
in you, as far as

1373
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:39,670
we understand it.

1374
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:42,130
You can both remember you saw
the word list, but if you

1375
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:44,340
switch your thinking a little
bit, your behavior a little

1376
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:48,210
bit, the unconscious system gets
into the driver's seat.

1377
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:52,070
Because the people with good
memory were giving stamp often

1378
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:54,770
but no more or less than HM.

1379
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:55,950
So unconscious.

1380
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:59,930
So what part of the brain does
this kind of memory?

1381
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:02,860
And our insight to that comes
from Alzheimer's disease.

1382
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:08,390
So HM's kind of amnesia
is extremely rare.

1383
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:09,630
Huntington's is quite rare.

1384
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:12,200
Alzheimer's is tragically
common.

1385
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:15,510
In fact, they went to East
Boston, the area near Logan,

1386
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:17,780
and knocked on doors
of people's homes.

1387
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:18,850
Not people in nursing homes.

1388
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:19,670
At home.

1389
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:20,570
And they estimated--

1390
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,620
and there's debates about
this back and forth.

1391
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:28,000
But about half the people over
85 who answered the door

1392
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,340
qualify for diagnosis of
Alzheimer's disease.

1393
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:34,480
About half over 85.

1394
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,360
There's debates about this.

1395
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,200
There's debates about whether
all of us would get it if we

1396
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,350
lived long enough.

1397
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:43,790
But as American society gets
older, as us baby boomers all

1398
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:47,920
move into our '60s, '70s, and
'80s, there's going to be a

1399
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,800
heck of a lot of people around
with Alzheimer's disease.

1400
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,080
And some of you have probably
experienced this, with

1401
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,610
grandparents if nothing else.

1402
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:57,350
It's a very devastating disorder
for the patient, for

1403
00:52:57,350 --> 00:52:58,325
the spouse or family.

1404
00:52:58,325 --> 00:53:00,480
It's a very challenging
disorder.

1405
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,960
So what is Alzheimer's
disease?

1406
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,885
Well behaviorally,
it's an insidious

1407
00:53:03,885 --> 00:53:05,180
and progressive dementia.

1408
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:09,070
Dementia means, unlike HM, it's
many losses of abilities.

1409
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:09,790
Unlike HM.

1410
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:11,470
HM had his surgery
one day, boom.

1411
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:12,510
That was it.

1412
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:14,430
Alzheimer's starts very
slowly and gets worse

1413
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:15,740
and worse over time.

1414
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:18,840
The biggest problem early on
is memory, the most common

1415
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:21,430
problem but over time,
language, thinking,

1416
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:24,060
concentration, spatial thinking,
sometimes mood and

1417
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:28,740
personality, all of these
get altered over time.

1418
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:31,430
In the brain when you look at
the changes, you see that the

1419
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:34,300
changes occur especially in the
hippocampal region-- so

1420
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,700
that's why the memory
problem is like HM--

1421
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:40,270
and also in some other parts
of the cortex, but not so

1422
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:42,960
much, for example, in basal
ganglia, that we just spoke

1423
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,000
about as important for
procedural memory.

1424
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,640
Here's a control brain and
equal-aged Alzheimer's brain.

1425
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:52,820
The reason why these gyri, this
whole side widened is

1426
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:57,740
because of widespread neuronal
shrinkage or death.

1427
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:00,540
And what's happening inside the
brain, when you look at

1428
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:03,480
post mortem, there's sort of
neurofibrillary tangles and

1429
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,740
plaques that are associated
with the diseases.

1430
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:07,800
The tangles are something
about the

1431
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,410
cells that have died.

1432
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:12,130
The plaques are thought to be
maybe part of the process that

1433
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:14,590
leads to the disorder, but
there's a debate about

1434
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:16,840
that to this day.

1435
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:20,100
And if you look, on post mortem,
where the tangles are,

1436
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:23,050
the tangles up here, you can see
they're most dense in the

1437
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:26,600
hippocampus or near the
hippocampus, like HM.

1438
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:29,030
And so that's why we think so
many patients with Alzheimer's

1439
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:31,830
have an HM-like memory
problem and then more

1440
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:33,710
problems after that.

1441
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:36,680
So here's a healthy person
top of the brain.

1442
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:40,330
Here's the left and right
hippocampus in an 81-year-old.

1443
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:43,090
And here in an 80-year-old
Alzheimer's patient, the

1444
00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:45,905
hippocampus has withered away,
both sides of the brain,

1445
00:54:45,905 --> 00:54:48,030
bilaterally.

1446
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:51,020
So one more brain perspective
on this.

1447
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:53,030
This is a SPECT scan, that just
shows you where there's

1448
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:54,920
blood flow and metabolism.

1449
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,480
Top of the brain, bottom
of the brain.

1450
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,500
Here's the insides of the
temporal lobes in a healthy

1451
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,290
elderly adult.

1452
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:02,320
Look how much worse--

1453
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,100
this is HM.

1454
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:03,950
He looks pretty good, right?

1455
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:06,145
You have to look really hard to
see that the hippocampus is

1456
00:55:06,145 --> 00:55:08,180
missing because it's such
a small structure.

1457
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,830
And here's an early-stage
Alzheimer's patient.

1458
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:13,500
Lots of the tissue is there, but
a lot of-- you know, it's

1459
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:17,550
not functioning because there's
so much damage.

1460
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:20,080
Here's the medial temporal lobes
but also cortical areas

1461
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:21,330
that are compromised.

1462
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:23,160

1463
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:23,690
OK, again.

1464
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:26,770
Not their biggest problem, but
in terms of thinking about

1465
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:28,020
different parts of the
brain and what parts

1466
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,430
of memory they do--

1467
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:32,720
So these are amnesic patients,
including HM, Alzheimer's

1468
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,250
patients, and green
in controls.

1469
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:36,340
So recall of the list, what
words were on the list,

1470
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:39,110
explicit memory bad in the
two patient groups.

1471
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:42,190
Recognition pretty poor.

1472
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:44,240
Word stem completion, the kind
of thing that we said is

1473
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,440
completely normal in
HM, that's impaired

1474
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,480
in Alzheimer's disease.

1475
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,730
So we think that kind of
priming depends on the

1476
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:54,880
neocortex, the part of the brain
that's also injured in

1477
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:55,490
Alzheimer's.

1478
00:55:55,490 --> 00:55:58,600
Because we know it doesn't
depend on the hippocampus,

1479
00:55:58,600 --> 00:55:59,220
because the patients with

1480
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:01,900
hippocampus-only damage are fine.

1481
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:05,120
So we end up with a picture
like this of something on

1482
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:05,830
memory systems.

1483
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:08,680
For explicit or declarative
memory, from patients with

1484
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:11,330
amnesia, we know it depends on
the medial temporal lobe.

1485
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:13,790
Left, verbal; right, spatial.

1486
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:16,510
For skill learning, anything you
practice many times to get

1487
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:19,880
better at, we know from
Huntington's disease, that

1488
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,950
depends on the basal ganglia.

1489
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:25,080
For kinds of priming, recent
experience altering something

1490
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,880
about brain organization,
Alzheimer's disease, we know

1491
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:31,320
from that that it's likely
mediated by the neocortex.

1492
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,740
These are from patient studies,
but the imaging

1493
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:34,730
studies are very well aligned
with these things.

1494
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:38,050
So we think it's true not only
of patients, but of you, in

1495
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:40,550
terms of the instruments
of your brain.

1496
00:56:40,550 --> 00:56:42,935
So now we have not only
episodic memory

1497
00:56:42,935 --> 00:56:43,820
and semantic memory.

1498
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:44,910
We talked about procedural
memory.

1499
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:46,040
We talked about priming.

1500
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,520
I didn't talk about conditioning
today, but we've

1501
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,240
talked about that before.

1502
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,290
So I have two more slides
to add on conceptually.

1503
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:56,160
So in what sense was Karl Ashley
right or wrong when he

1504
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,450
said memory's all
over the brain?

1505
00:56:57,450 --> 00:56:59,240
Here's how we think
about it now.

1506
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:02,230
We think he was right that all
of your brain is learning.

1507
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:04,670
Practically all of your
brain is plastic.

1508
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:06,090
It changes with experience.

1509
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:07,960
But different parts
of your brain are

1510
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:08,880
learning different things.

1511
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,130
The basal ganglia is
learning how to

1512
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:11,680
be skilled at something.

1513
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,410
The neocortex, how to gain
knowledge and shift your

1514
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:17,100
representation of knowledge,
like in priming.

1515
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,510
The medial temporal lobe on the
left is learning verbal

1516
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:21,590
facts, and the right
is nonverbal

1517
00:57:21,590 --> 00:57:22,980
facts or spatial facts.

1518
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:25,400
So all of your brain is
learning, but it's learning

1519
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,430
different things.

1520
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:28,895
And in that sense we end up with
this metaphor that-- you

1521
00:57:28,895 --> 00:57:31,430
know, just like there's
a string section and a

1522
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:34,320
percussion section or something
like that, in you,

1523
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,290
there's all these different
instruments that are highly

1524
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:39,470
tuned in the way they're
organized to learn all the

1525
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:40,610
different things you learned.

1526
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:43,650
They're all pretty useful
instruments to have.

1527
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:45,870
And without these patients and
the imaging studies, we

1528
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:46,760
wouldn't have known that.

1529
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:47,950
You would be like the Martian.

1530
00:57:47,950 --> 00:57:49,440
One instrument?

1531
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,300
A thousand instruments?

1532
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,990
Well, we know there's multiple
ones, and we know pretty much

1533
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:54,560
which structures are
essential for them.

1534
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:55,810
