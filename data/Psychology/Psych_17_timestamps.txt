00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:33,370

10
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,850
PROFESSOR: OK, good afternoon.

11
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,146
Today's lecture is going to
be on child development.

12
00:00:40,146 --> 00:00:44,195
How they go from infancy and
head towards adulthood.

13
00:00:44,195 --> 00:00:48,668
Next Thursday we'll talk about
development after infancy and

14
00:00:48,668 --> 00:00:51,153
into adulthood and over age.

15
00:00:51,153 --> 00:00:53,935
And this amazing thing about
babies and how do they get

16
00:00:53,935 --> 00:00:56,850
going, and how do scientists
discover from babies and young

17
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,340
children how their minds
are fundamentally

18
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,680
different than adults.

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,739
And how your mind was
fundamentally different than

20
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:05,580
it is as an adult.

21
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,230
And then the last thing will
be a dangerous experiment,

22
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,420
where my wife will come over
with my two-year-old and my

23
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,370
four-year-old and we'll try
to do a developmental

24
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,520
demonstration in front of you.

25
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,520
But I should warn you
that live children

26
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,420
have their own will.

27
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,280
So we'll see how that
goes, okay?

28
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,420
All right.

29
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,080
So one thing that people are
struck by babies is that

30
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,680
babies are cute.

31
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,300
And it's not just--

32
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,780
It's thought to be not just
fun, but kind of a really

33
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,570
important biological thing.

34
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,310
We talked about motherese
before.

35
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,410
Singsong talk to babies that
help them learn a language.

36
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,710
There's something about adults
finding babies cute that makes

37
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,760
them want to help babies.

38
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,550
Parents and friends--

39
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:54,620
The cuteness is thought to be
an evolutionary reward for

40
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,640
dealing with a baby.

41
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,270
And people have said, well what
is it that's a little bit

42
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,710
different about a baby's
face than an adult?

43
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,190
They have rounder heads, they
have foreheads that protrude

44
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,670
more towards--

45
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,850
that slope back more.

46
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,330
They have larger eyes
proportionately.

47
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,130
Smaller jaw bones
proportionally.

48
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,800
And people use the term neotony
to describe this kind

49
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,730
of infant proportions, or
properties, of faces, which

50
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,620
are universal.

51
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,320
And, of course, a lot of
people discover this in

52
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,070
advertising or cartoons.

53
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:28,040
And so here's an interesting
example of how Mickey Mouse

54
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,710
has, over the years, from the
original version of Mickey

55
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:35,100
Mouse to the current super
cute, super tested, super

56
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,620
Disney version of Mickey Mouse,
has become increasingly

57
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,400
neotonized.

58
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,180
And how much the cartoonists
literally know that, or just

59
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,490
have kept saying, what makes
cuter, and cuter, and cuter,

60
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,015
and ended up with a lot of the
same proportions in Mickey

61
00:02:47,015 --> 00:02:51,370
Mouse's face that make infants
so cute and desirable.

62
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,020
We don't really know.

63
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,780
But the world kind
of feels this.

64
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,640
Even adult research-- there's
a little funny line of

65
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,410
research-- that says adults who
look more baby-faced get

66
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,225
treated a little bit
different socially.

67
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:07,950

68
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,330
So here's Leonardo DiCaprio.

69
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,150
And baby-faced adults in
experiments are perceived as,

70
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,030
just by their faces, as more
naive, more honest, more

71
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,660
helpless, more kind,
more warm.

72
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,640
People think, this is going
to be a nice warm person.

73
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,980
Guessing from faces they're
using the cues of neotony.

74
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,170
Other studies have found that
people who are baby-faced are

75
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:34,200
statistically more likely to be
found innocent in cases of

76
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,070
intentional wrongdoing.

77
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,760
So where they're trying to prove
if somebody on purpose

78
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,190
tried to do something
bad, they go, not

79
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,670
that cute little person.

80
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,560
But there's no difference if
it's cases that involve

81
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,240
negligence.

82
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,280
Something where you should
have done something.

83
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,640
Because we know babies aren't
super responsible

84
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,890
for how they behave.

85
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:55,470

86
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,820
And they're less likely to
receive votes in elections.

87
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,100
So people have done--

88
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,710
I won't even tell you this-- but
people have done all kinds

89
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,405
of analyses of faces that
win elections in the US

90
00:04:04,405 --> 00:04:05,680
and around the world.

91
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,270
And there's two dimensions
that people look for.

92
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,890
What looks like somebody's
empathetic and what looks like

93
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,760
somebody's competent.

94
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,010
So you want babies when it's
fun, but when you have to

95
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,260
figure out how to balance the
budget that doesn't seem like

96
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,399
a baby task.

97
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,079
So it's kind of funny.

98
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,680
And a lot of voters go by
instincts as well as by facts

99
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,440
or stated values.

100
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,610
So in the development of infants
into adults, the

101
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,990
classic debates about how our
mind grasps the world have

102
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,520
played out, yet again,
in a powerful way.

103
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,970
You know, the nature-nurture
debate.

104
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,190
What's in our genes
and gets us going?

105
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,990
What's acquired from
the environment?

106
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,100
Philosophers who say that
knowledge starts with innate,

107
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,810
or genetic, or more evolved
capacities.

108
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,180
Other ones who've emphasized
that we pick it up from the

109
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:57,560
world empirically as measuring
scientists.

110
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,540
So, for example, Aristotle
wrote, "There's nothing in the

111
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,430
intellect which was not first
in the senses." that's the

112
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,310
empirical view.

113
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,900
It's out there in the world
and you solve it.

114
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,200
And starting with
a blank slate.

115
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,980
And, in fact, the behaviorists
believed in this with a

116
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,540
vengeance in psychology.

117
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,960
So Watson wrote, "Give me a
dozen healthy infants, well

118
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,980
formed, and my own specified
world to bring them up.

119
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,400
And I'll guarantee to take any
of them, one at random, and

120
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,610
train him to become any type of
specialist I might select.

121
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,910
A doctor, lawyer, artist,
merchant, chief, and, yes,

122
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,140
even beggerman and thief.

123
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,660
That it's all the environment
and a blank slate.

124
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,700
And who really knows?"

125
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,220
But infants are born with some
incredible things, an we'll

126
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,470
talk about them today.

127
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,985
One of them is this experiment
from Andy

128
00:05:38,985 --> 00:05:41,790
Meltzoff, which is this.

129
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:45,460
That it seems like within
moments of birth, infants are

130
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:50,090
equipped with a desire
to imitate adults.

131
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,010
A desire to imitate.

132
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,550
And why people have been really
impressed by this is,

133
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,900
if you have that in your genes
and in your nature, it's a

134
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,090
good way to learn about the
world is to imitate people you

135
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,070
see around you.

136
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,930
It's kind of a driving
principal.

137
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:08,760
I'll imitate their language,
their social mores.

138
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,390
Here's what Meltzoff did.

139
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:14,440
Sticks out his tongue, opens
his mouth, purses his lips.

140
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,960
And here's the infant, one day
or a couple days old, tongue

141
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,700
out, mouth open, lips pursed.

142
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,510
Now, I should warn you
about one thing.

143
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,860
These are the greatest hits
pieces of that research.

144
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,480
People debate about
how perfectly this

145
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,600
happens, all right?

146
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,070
So I was frustrated when my
infant came home and I did all

147
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,560
this stuff and she would not
instantly do everything she

148
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,830
was supposed to do.

149
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,050
It's a statistical thing.

150
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,230
Because when you see these
pictures, they're showing you

151
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,300
the best moments.

152
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,090
They have to defend that it
happens above chances

153
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:43,720
statistically.

154
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,370
But it's not like every
expression you

155
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,170
make they copy you.

156
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,290
And that's why there's still
some debate about exactly

157
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,130
what's going on.

158
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,740
But they definitely, on average,
imitate an adult

159
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,590
within a day or two of birth
for completely arbitrary--

160
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,660
as far as we think--

161
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,900
expressions.

162
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,400
So it's a very powerful
mechanism for learning that

163
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,410
appears to be in place.

164
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:05,800
Because there's two ways that
we could imagine genetically

165
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,320
programmed learning.

166
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,660
One is that you know the
content of it already.

167
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,760
But another way is that
you just have stuff

168
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,340
that makes you a learner.

169
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,270
So being an imitator is a
general way to make you a

170
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,990
learner without being very
specific to the content.

171
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,680
So we talked a little bit
about this already, but

172
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,630
psychologists are unbelievably
brilliant--

173
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,980
I think, I'm really blown away--
about how they can

174
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:32,010
figure out when an infant knows
and doesn't know, or

175
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,740
young child knows
or doesn't know.

176
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,610
And they do this indirectly by
things like looking time.

177
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,550
And you've seen this.

178
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,450
I'll give you an
example or two.

179
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,840
And you'll see some
more examples.

180
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,360
As a measure of what
the baby knows, or

181
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,690
the young child knows.

182
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,760
And, of course, if they look
longer at something it could

183
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,220
be because they prefer it.

184
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,760
And, also, if it's based
on a memory task--

185
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,420
like you saw something,
you see it again--

186
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,090
that would tell you there's some
sort of discrimination .

187
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,630
They can tell things apart
based on memory.

188
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,850
And then, sometimes, people will
push this memory thing

189
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,710
with habituation or
familiarization, so if you

190
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:07,490
show something to a baby over,
and over, and over again, they

191
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,140
get sort of tired of it.

192
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,570
And at that moment they'll
change the stimulus.

193
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:15,050
And they'll see whether the
baby gets newly attentive.

194
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,340
Now, if it's something that the
baby doesn't grasp, they

195
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,610
won't get newly attentive.

196
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,640
You know, nothing's changed
in their mind.

197
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,030
If it's something the baby
understands, then they'll say,

198
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,530
wow, something interesting
is happening.

199
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,210
And they'll look longer.

200
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,070
So, here's an example.

201
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,364
Baby getting bored because
they're showing something over

202
00:08:32,364 --> 00:08:34,740
and over, and something
new, oh!

203
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,289
That's the kind of things
that people measure.

204
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:37,710
And we're doing it
loosely here.

205
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,740
They measure it pretty
carefully.

206
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,789
I should tell you, the people
who do this kind of research--

207
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:44,800
they'll film it, they'll show
it to unbiased people like

208
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,760
you, maybe judges.

209
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,790
OK, to say, how long is
the baby looking?

210
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,260
Where's it looking?

211
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,300
You don't know where the baby
should be looking at or not.

212
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,230
So researchers take care to make
it not just that you're

213
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,680
convinced in your heart
of hearts that

214
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,370
they're looking more.

215
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,290
They film it.

216
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,970
They show it to people who don't
know what's going on.

217
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,010
They try to make it a blind
procedure in many ways, the

218
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,440
better research.

219
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,610
So how do we know things?

220
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,910
Even very young infants look
selectively at novel objects.

221
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:10,410
If something's new, even at
one day, if you show them

222
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,900
checkerboards with different
size squares, same size, same

223
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,850
size, same size, wait a couple
seconds, smaller squares.

224
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,240
They look more.

225
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,520
This shows you they saw the
difference in the squares.

226
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,560
They even remember, somehow in
their mind, the difference

227
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,620
between the squares.

228
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,890
Because when you switch it
they start looking more.

229
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:31,580
Something interesting has
happened based on perception

230
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,080
and memory.

231
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,140
Another thing that
we've mentioned--

232
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,290
I'll just remind you-- is that
infants, almost from birth,

233
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:40,720
seem to love to control, or
provoke, their environment.

234
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,350
So we already mentioned to you
that 20 month olds prefer a

235
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,310
mobile that responds to their
bodily movements.

236
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,940
They like things that
they control.

237
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,610
If they take a two-month-old,
and they put a string on their

238
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:53,509
wrist by which they can control
a showing of Sesame

239
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:57,260
Street, they kind
of like that.

240
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,910
And if you stop Sesame Street,
they show anger on their face.

241
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:03,210
Hey, I was in charge here, who
has the remote control now.

242
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,875
And four and five month olds,
a little bit older, remain

243
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:09,190
angry when the video comes back
on because that's not

244
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,930
what they wanted.

245
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,850
They wanted to control the
presentation of the video.

246
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:17,470
So infants have this apparent
craving to explore and feel

247
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:20,470
like they have some control over
their environment, at an

248
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,820
age when they don't control a
lot because of their limited

249
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,460
physical capacity.

250
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,290
In the first three or four
months, infants explore the

251
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,980
world a lot by their mouths.

252
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,890
That's why people worry to not
leave around things that they

253
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:36,010
will put into their mouth and
swallow, that are dangerous.

254
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,070
Because their visual and
auditory systems, and their

255
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,460
system with their hand,
are slowly developing.

256
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,540
By five or six months around
the world, they start to

257
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,450
explore with their hands and
their eyes around them.

258
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,580
As their motor system
gets more mature.

259
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,120
As their visual system
gains acuity.

260
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,340
And we already know that infants
use social cues to

261
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,250
guide exploration.

262
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,660
One of the big changes this
happened in the last 10 years,

263
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:00,880
I'd say, in infant studies or
child studies, has been a lot

264
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,230
of appreciation about the
intersection between cognition

265
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,590
and social interaction.

266
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,365
There used to be like two
different worlds of people who

267
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:08,400
studied language.

268
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,980
They would have algorithms and
formulas about the language.

269
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,400
And then the social people who'd
study how babies were

270
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,740
cute or something, right?

271
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,400
But there's been more and more
thought that a deep thing in

272
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,980
us that helps cognition grow,
is the social relations that

273
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,140
an infant is drawn to parents
and caretakers.

274
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:28,250
So, for example, a
six-month-old, if their mother

275
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,850
rolls or pounds a ball, they
tend to copy, they tend to

276
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,270
imitate that action.

277
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,180
They follow the eyes
of a person.

278
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,060
Joint attention.

279
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,210
You know, eyes are the
windows on the soul.

280
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,540
We know eyes mean a lot.

281
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,860
Where are people putting
their attention?

282
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,380
What are they paying
attention to?

283
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,750
Infants pick up on this
very early on.

284
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,720
And if somebody looks over there
they look over there.

285
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,540
If you look at them they
know your attention

286
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,030
is focused on them.

287
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,730
And sometimes people
will say--

288
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,570
because psychologists love to
test everything-- is it just

289
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,100
the way the head is turning?

290
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,540
So if you cover somebody's
head they

291
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,760
don't follow it anymore.

292
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,440
They know it has to be the eyes
reflecting where the mind

293
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,010
is putting its attention.

294
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,230
It's not the head direction.

295
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,500
It's the eyes.

296
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,750
Here's something, infants who
are a little bit better at

297
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,200
following eyes--

298
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,800
either maturing faster
or something--

299
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,810
also learn language faster.

300
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,020
They get words faster,
and syntax faster.

301
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:22,100
It's as if part of that social
interaction is helping to

302
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,700
drive the language learning.

303
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,140
So that's how these social
things and language things

304
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,440
interact very substantially.

305
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,000
And we already said that a
12-month-old will stop at a

306
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,970
visual cliff, but if the mother
smiles there they go.

307
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,920
So constant learning
that mixes in the

308
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,160
cognitive and the social.

309
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,506
Now the epic name in
developmental psychology is

310
00:12:42,506 --> 00:12:43,130
Jean Piaget.

311
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,950
Because prior to him, roughly
speaking, in the science of

312
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,880
child development, people just
thought children were sort of

313
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,460
boring and dumb.

314
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,310
They need a lot of attention.

315
00:12:55,310 --> 00:13:00,390
Please finish MIT so we can talk
with you intelligently.

316
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,130
I guess people were not
that interested.

317
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,020
Partly is the world was
different in so many ways.

318
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,130
There was no-- practically
no--

319
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,280
formal psychology
experimentation or thought

320
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,270
about what really children's
mental lives were like.

321
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,501
And Piaget--

322
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:17,840
I have a wrong year
there, 1886--

323
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,020
developed--

324
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,920
he himself was a child prodigy,
trained in biology.

325
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,430
Very early interest in whether
categories are in our heads or

326
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,540
in the world.

327
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,260
Tried poetry.

328
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,070
Worked with Binet on
intelligence testing.

329
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,100
Became interested in patterns
of errors and successes.

330
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,510
You'll see that in many ways,
what he discovered about how a

331
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:36,150
child mind is different than
yours fundamentally, is based

332
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,470
on the patterns of
their errors.

333
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,590
And he said, there's two
basic things going on.

334
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,980
This is a huge idea.

335
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,960
One is assimilation, you
incorporate new knowledge into

336
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,270
existing cognitive structures.

337
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,790
It's basically ways you
think about the world.

338
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,350
And new knowledge is added.

339
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,660
That's important.

340
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,140
But he thought the dramatic
thing that happens in infancy

341
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,600
and childhood is what he
called adaptation.

342
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,930
That the fundamental ways in
which you understand the world

343
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,960
are shifted, through
development, to accommodate

344
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,940
new evidence.

345
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,930
So there's a wonderful book if
you come across it called The

346
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,940
Scientist in the Crib.

347
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,030
But it's kind of a pun.

348
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,890
It's written by scientists
who study infants.

349
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,600
But the idea is that, in a
sense, every infant is kind of

350
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,870
his or her own scientist--

351
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:15,720
as you were--

352
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,500
probing the world and
discovering the physical and

353
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,390
social laws of the world.

354
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,530
Because they don't know them
coming in and they're going to

355
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,750
pick up a lot of them.

356
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,610
They're going to probe them.

357
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:30,050
But fail to publish
the results.

358
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:33,380
So Piaget postulated that were
these big stages, what he

359
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,220
called the Sensorimotor age,
zero to two, where the world

360
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,820
is one of what you see and
the physical actions.

361
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,920
And there's not much
representation of ideas or

362
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,810
lasting thoughts.

363
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,960
And we'll see some examples
of these.

364
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,950
Between two and seven, you start
to be able to keep a

365
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,160
thought in your mind.

366
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,840
You still have an egocentric
prospective.

367
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,720
You see the world from your view
but not appreciating the

368
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,770
views of somebody else.

369
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,800
You start to use language.

370
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,430
A lot of flimsy discussion about
fantasy and reality.

371
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,340
I could tell you with my own
daughter, who you'll meet,

372
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,660
she's still working out
whether fairies

373
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,530
really exist or not.

374
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,700
This was chaotic because we
went to some skating show

375
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,720
where Tinkerbell was a human
dancing, and that totally made

376
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,970
the situation very
complicated.

377
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,430

378
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,680
She's still working on that.

379
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,920
Concrete, as you get 7 to 11,
organize logical thought.

380
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,420
Still concrete, as opposed
to sort of abstract.

381
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,080
And then you move to more adult
like cognition, which

382
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,270
we'll talk about next week.

383
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:33,060
So the idea is from birth to two
years, you would love to

384
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,830
have an infant just tell you
what do I think the world is

385
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:36,360
really like.

386
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,800
They have very modest language,
of course, so they

387
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,390
can't tell you what they see.

388
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:43,630
So the thought is they have
fleeting, disconnected sensory

389
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,030
impressions and motor
reactions.

390
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,270
It's all, what do I see?

391
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,160
How am I responding?

392
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,500
That their focus of thought is
centered on actions, not

393
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,990
things or intentions.

394
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,190
And I'll show you in a
very concrete way.

395
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,170
That there's no distinction in
their mind between things that

396
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,680
are stable in the world
and transient events.

397
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,620
No distinction between
themselves and the world

398
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,140
around them.

399
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:09,150
It's all just one big mush until
they connect abstract

400
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:12,650
representations that separate
these things out.

401
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:18,700
So let's talk about
object permanence.

402
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,160
I'm going to show you that you
have object permanence just by

403
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,940
saying, here's my pointer.

404
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,650
I need a volunteer.

405
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:31,260
This is so easy that you
will not feel scared.

406
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,200
I promise.

407
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:34,410
All right.

408
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,320
Thank you very much.

409
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,880
So you see this?

410
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,950
Where do you think it is now?

411
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,120
OK.

412
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,740
If I was really cool
teacher who did

413
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,690
magic it would be gone.

414
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:46,870
But yes, and you know
it's there.

415
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,070
That's object permanence.

416
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,630
If you turn your head
you believe it's

417
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,540
probably still there.

418
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:56,900
But that's going beyond the
fundamentals of perception,

419
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,820
that's your knowledge, and
representing in your head,

420
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,350
there's something I don't see
but I know it's there.

421
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:04,980
That is not available to
a zero to two year old.

422
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:09,660
So, for example, if they see a
rattle they feel a rattle.

423
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,640
But now if they look away, or
if you just put a sheet of

424
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,420
paper in front of it--

425
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,339
I'll show you a couple
of examples--

426
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:19,109
they behave as if the rattle
no longer exists.

427
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:20,520
Just like I did in
front of you.

428
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,510
If you just cover it up, it's
gone as if it doesn't exist.

429
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,579
Because their mind cannot
represent what they do not see

430
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,960
right in front of them.

431
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,200
So out of sight out
of existence.

432
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,660
So you can show them a toy they
love, and until about

433
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,590
eight months, you
could do this.

434
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,480
They'll start crying.

435
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,020
They'll protest.

436
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,650
But they won't reach for it,
even when it's easily within

437
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,610
their reach.

438
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,730
Out of sight, out of mind.

439
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,330
It doesn't exist.

440
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:50,560
They can't represent in their
mind what they don't see.

441
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,590
And then there's another one.

442
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,990
You'll see a film of this.

443
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:53,920
But let me tell you this.

444
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,180
Which tells you about actions
verses other things.

445
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,400
So imagine you hide a toy under
one location, the child

446
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,720
searches there, finds it.

447
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,090
You hide it again in
the same location.

448
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,520
You encourage the
child to search.

449
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,050
They find it.

450
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,450
They do it two or three times.

451
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:12,130
Now, in front of the child, you
take that same object that

452
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,590
you've shown them like
this several times.

453
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,280
They've grabbed several times.

454
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,780
And you simply, in front
of them, pick it up

455
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,070
and put it over here.

456
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,510
And they're viewing everything
in full view,

457
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,240
just like you did.

458
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,810
What do they do?

459
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:26,990
When it's their turn to
grab they grab here.

460
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:27,790
The wrong place.

461
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,920
The place where they
grab before.

462
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,650
Because what's in their mind
is the action they did.

463
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,250
Not the object as an independent
thing they can put

464
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:36,670
in their mind.

465
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,690
Does that makes sense?

466
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,320
And I'll show you several
pieces of this.

467
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,120
It's called the A-not-B
effect.

468
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,440
I put this A, A, A, A in
the front, full view.

469
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,920
Put it over here and they reach
over here to get it.

470
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:56,360
So this is this idea, that in
their head is not a toy.

471
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,910
Their head is representing the
thing on the right that they

472
00:18:58,910 --> 00:18:59,460
reached for.

473
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,450
Because they don't represent
ideas of things.

474
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:05,610
They represent actions
that they've done.

475
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,220
So here's object permanence.

476
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,650
Here's a child sees
a toy they like.

477
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,616
You put up, in front of them,
this thing and tragically,

478
00:19:13,616 --> 00:19:15,640
it's disappeared.

479
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,190
It's gone out of existence
in the world.

480
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:21,740

481
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,020
Some people have done some
sort of NIRS imaging

482
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:27,990
suggesting that kids who get
past this stage are developing

483
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,950
some frontal maturation.

484
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,660
But I think the most compelling
things are the

485
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,910
videos of the kids themselves.

486
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:38,450

487
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:41,530
So let me show you another film,
again very cleverly, the

488
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,880
Renee Baillergon has been one
the leaders in this field--

489
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:51,520
very cleverly showing you what
infants grasp and don't grasp.

490
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,360
Not only the brilliance
of these experiments.

491
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,320
These infants are really trying
to figure out the

492
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,990
world, and coming up with
hypotheses that they're

493
00:19:58,990 --> 00:19:59,580
confirming.

494
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,100
And then when they're broken
down they're upset with

495
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,130
what's going on.

496
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,890
So let's move on to age two to
seven, especially in the early

497
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:09,160
years, so-called a
preoperational stage.

498
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,100
And one of the coolest things,
and we'll try this and see how

499
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:16,320
it goes with some girls in a
few minutes, is this idea.

500
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,130
So if you see two glasses filled
with equal amounts of

501
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:23,070
liquid, and you pour one over
into the thinner, taller

502
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:27,720
glass, c, which will have
more water in it?

503
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,930
A or C?

504
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,180
The same.

505
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,460

506
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,650
But not if you're a two year
old or a four-year-old.

507
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,700
So it's called conservation
of liquid.

508
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:45,840

509
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,230
So, it's kind of fascinating,
isn't it?

510
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,190
It's kind of amazing.

511
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,000
If you do this with a three
year old it's virtually

512
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,210
guaranteed they'll do this.

513
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,403
All of you did it all
over the world.

514
00:20:55,403 --> 00:20:57,935
And, in some sense, as far as we
can guess , all throughout

515
00:20:57,935 --> 00:20:59,220
our species' history.

516
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,660
So brilliant ways of showing
that babies, or young

517
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:06,990
children, really see a little
bit of a different world than

518
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:11,940
you and I as adults.

519
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:16,080
So here's another very powerful
area of research,

520
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,650
which is taking perspectives
from the view that other

521
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,810
people have thoughts and
feelings besides yourself and

522
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,060
how you interact with them.

523
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,330

524
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,260
And people call this idea
theory of mind.

525
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:32,030
The idea that you understand
that other people out there

526
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:35,360
have their own thoughts, their
own feelings distinct from

527
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,040
yours, and in the most
challenging case, they can

528
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,990
even be false beliefs.

529
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:43,580
A person can have wrong
information in their head and

530
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,370
truly believe it, even when
you know it's wrong.

531
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,520
Because you, as an adult,
realize that thoughts are one

532
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,320
thing and physical reality
is another thing.

533
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,700
But that's not what
children think.

534
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,540
They think there's
just one reality.

535
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,670
That's why at the very youngest
age, they think if

536
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:01,970
they cover their eyes that you
don't know where they are,.

537
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:04,220
Because they think there's one
physical reality only.

538
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,500
And they don't realize there's
another prospective

539
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,080
besides their own.

540
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,250
So here's a very clever
experiment showing you that at

541
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:15,090
three months, children code the
word in terms of actions.

542
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:18,010
And by six to nine months,
they begin to understand

543
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:21,320
intentions, that people out
there-- animals too but we'll

544
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,550
just focus on people--
have intentions and

545
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,140
goals in their head.

546
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,900
So here's what the experiment
they do using this

547
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,580
habituation.

548
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,460
There's two pedestals here, and
a person reaches again and

549
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,960
again for a ball.

550
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,190
So now, what do you believe
the intention is?

551
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,630
To reach for the ball.

552
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,790
You see it 10 times, the
baby's losing interest.

553
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:47,470
Now comes their shocker to get
the baby crying, or laughing,

554
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,180
or drooling.

555
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,410
Get the baby's attention
that you can

556
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,380
measure by how they respond.

557
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,950
And in some conditions,
something goes down, and when

558
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,460
it goes back up the
person reaches.

559
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,240
But now they take
the same action.

560
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,950
They reach for the left
pedestal, but

561
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,580
it's a teddy bear.

562
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,380
Or another case, they reach
for the ball in

563
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,240
the opposite side.

564
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,780
Who, depending on their age,
sees these two different

565
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:15,300
changes in the scenario
as startling?

566
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,750
The three month olds are
startled when the person

567
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:23,150
reaches for the same object.

568
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,350
The three month old.

569
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:27,270
Because in their mind, the only
thing that was really

570
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,960
happening was reach for the
left, reach for the left,

571
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,620
reach for the left.

572
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,030
And now you're reaching
for the right.

573
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,050
The action changed.

574
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,010
Because the action is
independent of intention.

575
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,060
It's just what happened, what
happened, what happened.

576
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,080
They're shocked when
the person goes for

577
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,510
the ball over here.

578
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,810
By six to nine months,
they're shocked--

579
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:45,000
relatively speaking--

580
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,060
when the person reaches for the
same action but now the

581
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,260
goal is different.

582
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,660
Grabbing the teddy bear.

583
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,080
It's as if they understand the
intention of the person was to

584
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,710
get the ball, and these children
think the only thing

585
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,870
that's happening is physical
action, physical action,

586
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:58,890
physical action.

587
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:01,950
So very clever experiment by
this habituation and looking

588
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:05,660
time to show at three months
all you see is actions.

589
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:09,260
And by six to nine months you
start to grasp that people

590
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:12,360
have intentions in their head
above and beyond their actions

591
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,700
that govern their actions.

592
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,020
So to make it really tricky,
there's this very clever

593
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,460
experiment that makes--

594
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,150
and we'll try it in
a few minutes--

595
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:22,550
this way.

596
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,950
This so-called Sally-Anne
problem because it's been so

597
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,760
widely cited and discussed.

598
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,880
So you tell a child
this story.

599
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,210
Imagine there's two girls
here, Sally and Anne.

600
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:35,300
And Sally takes a ball and
puts it in this basket.

601
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,570
And then she leaves the room.

602
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:40,910
Anne, who's a little bit of a
troublemaker takes the ball

603
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:44,730
out of here and puts it into
this box, and closes the box.

604
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:47,100
Here's the big question.

605
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,030
When Sally comes back and looks
for this ball, where

606
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,060
will she look?

607
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,860
And a three year old
says, in the box.

608
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,770
Now if she was out of the room
there's no way for her to look

609
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:57,500
that's in the box.

610
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,750
But for the three year
old, there's not

611
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,090
thoughts and reality.

612
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:03,220
There's just kind of reality.

613
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,520
Does that make sense?

614
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,410
The three year old can't
entertain the idea that Sally

615
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:10,770
has, in her head, wrong
knowledge of

616
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:11,580
where this ball is.

617
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,370
The she couldn't have known
where it is and she's going to

618
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:15,070
act on the knowledge
that's in her head.

619
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:17,300
That's the content
of her mind.

620
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,395
The three year old says there's
one reality, the ball

621
00:25:19,395 --> 00:25:20,420
is over here.

622
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,280
I know it.

623
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,160
Everybody knows it.

624
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,170
What else is there to
even think about?

625
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:28,740
But that typical five-year-old
will say, Sally will look in

626
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,870
the wrong place.

627
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,840
She'll look in the basket.

628
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,810
She'll look in the wrong
place compared to

629
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:34,650
where the ball is now.

630
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:35,870
Because she believes
it's there.

631
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,390
She has the wrong idea
in her head.

632
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:40,970
That ideas can be independent of
physical, observable things

633
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:43,590
in the world.

634
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,870
This is a universal finding.

635
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,050
I'm going to have to
change my settings.

636
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:46,670
Sorry.

637
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,620
Your handout has this.

638
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,540
In practically every country
where they've tested this,

639
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,150
three year olds don't have
a theory of mind,

640
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,760
five year olds do.

641
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,660
Turns out--

642
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,420
and you could take a guess--

643
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:02,020
the older sibling you have,
the younger you become at

644
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,420
getting a good theory of mind.

645
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:08,840
Nobody really knows what the
answer but what's your guess?

646
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,480
The more siblings you
have that are older

647
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,540
than you, the younger--

648
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,090
by some number of months--
people tend to show that they

649
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:17,290
can understand that people have
all kinds of thoughts and

650
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:19,150
beliefs in their head.

651
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,290
What's your guess?

652
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:21,180
Yeah.

653
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,340
AUDIENCE: They have gone
through versions of the

654
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,020
Sally-Anne problem themselves.

655
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,980
PROFESSOR: They may have been
tortured by their siblings.

656
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,070
But on top of that, the
intuition is-- and we don't

657
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,160
really know, this is hard to--

658
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,210
they're living in a world,
because they have older

659
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,910
siblings who do unkind things
to them, who have superior

660
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:40,880
powers over them physically,
they're much more socially--

661
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,800
have to figure out what's going
on to survive happily

662
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,330
and make their way
in the world.

663
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:48,781
The big five year old, he or she
is dominant, and the two

664
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:50,530
year old is trying
to steer around.

665
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:51,910
Like, what is does that
five year old think?

666
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,330
How will I not get into
trouble with that

667
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:56,080
five-year-old and my mother
and my father?

668
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,430
A younger sibling has more
social pressures to figure out

669
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:02,430
what's going on and steer your
way around, and not get in

670
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:05,520
trouble with your
older siblings.

671
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,400
We'll come back to autism.

672
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,700
I'll just say a word
about this now.

673
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,480
You hear a lot about it.

674
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,050
The current guess is that it's
approximately 1 out of every

675
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,070
140 children.

676
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,060
A shockinging increase in
numbers to what people

677
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:19,160
believed it was many
years ago.

678
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,440
Mysteriously, there's
many more boys

679
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,240
than girls with autism.

680
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,790
Estimates are 4 to 1, or 10
to 1 range, all there.

681
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,650
It's hard to know for sure.

682
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,220
We'll talk more about that.

683
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,830
Autism is defined
by three things.

684
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,700
A sort of weakness, or
deficit, in social

685
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,470
interaction.

686
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,850
Children with autism, or adults,
have difficulty in

687
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,270
social interaction.

688
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,220
In communication.

689
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:43,030
And they have lots of repetitive
behaviors that can

690
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:46,630
be difficult to help in
interaction with others.

691
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:50,130
And when people test theory of
mind in children with autism,

692
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:53,410
it's typically delayed by five
or six years on average, for

693
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,420
those children who can
take the test at all.

694
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:59,470
They have a very slowly
developing, very delayed

695
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,450
theory of mind and understanding
what's in the

696
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:04,260
content of the thoughts
of other people.

697
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,990
And that's considered one of
their biggest challenges.

698
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,190
How they relate to
other people.

699
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:10,360
Understanding what the other
person's thinking and feeling.

700
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:15,470

701
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,080
Just for a couple minutes I'm
going to show you a video and

702
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,330
then we're going to try--

703
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:23,590
So the biggest challenges to
Piaget have been this idea

704
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:26,540
that there's these distinct
stages of thought.

705
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,410
That your mind shifts,
literally, how it's

706
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,570
constructed and understands
the world.

707
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:33,270
And that people have thought
that the process is much more

708
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:36,300
continuous than Piaget
had suggested.

709
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,260
And here's one compelling
example of that kind.

710
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,670
So this is the A-not-B
experiment.

711
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,490
There's a two food wells,
and something of

712
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,540
interest in this infant.

713
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:48,170
The seven month old looks
at the toy here.

714
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:49,420
It gets covered up.

715
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:53,110

716
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:56,500
It's placed in b, and b is
one of the two wells.

717
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,990
He continues to look at b
when both are covered.

718
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:01,090
He knows the toy
is over there.

719
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:04,610
And the toy has been placed
over and over again in a.

720
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,040
So he gets the A-not-B error.

721
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,750
He has the action.

722
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,170
And even though he sees the
toy is placed there.

723
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:11,050
It's covered up.

724
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,550
He's looking where the toy is.

725
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:16,750
When it's time to reach
he goes to this well.

726
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,510
So this is A-not-B error.

727
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:25,360
A part of his mind that guides
action is stuck and guides

728
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,740
what he reaches for.

729
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,850
But obviously another part of
his mind knows perfectly well

730
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:32,320
where the toy is.

731
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,180
So it's not as if it's all of
one, or all of another.

732
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,910
His mind is representing that
there's a toy down there, but

733
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,580
the part of his brain or mind
that guides his action is

734
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,760
still stuck at this early
developmental stage. it's if

735
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,190
he were two ages.

736
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,370
One guiding where
his eyes goes.

737
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,070
And one guiding the
ultimate action of

738
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,340
where his hands goes.

739
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,960
And as he gets a little older,
his eyes and hands will go in

740
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,390
the same place.

741
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:59,650
OK, last couple of things
about how infants are

742
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:01,300
mathematicians.

743
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,030
Because, of course, we focused
on language, or social

744
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:07,790
thought, but the ideas of
counting and, ultimately,

745
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:11,990
arithmetic or math also come
out of children's minds.

746
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,450
And a very clever experiment--

747
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,640
and I'll show you
two of them--

748
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,840
that shows even at six months,
infants are starting to

749
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,130
prepare themselves to become
mathematicians.

750
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:22,010
And here's how they begin
the counting.

751
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:25,480
They're shown displays of three
objects or two objects.

752
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,000
And then they hear two sounds
like boom boom.

753
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,450
And where do they look?

754
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:31,560
They tend to look at the
one with two objects.

755
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,830
So this is pretty impressive.

756
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,260
They're counting the two.

757
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:37,340
They're relating something in
sound to something in sight

758
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:40,050
that's arbitrarily related,
but that shares the

759
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,690
numerosity.

760
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:45,030
And if they get boom, boom,
boom, three boom sounds, then

761
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:48,680
they go, OK, now I like the
display with three things.

762
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,550
They understand, in some level,
twoness and threeness.

763
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:57,880
And so you start to have the
basis of having numbers.

764
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,820
And not only that, Karen Wynn
at Yale has shown quite

765
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,300
cleverly, not only do infants
have numbers.

766
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,530
They can do a little bit of
subtraction and addition.

767
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,190
So here's the experiment
she does.

768
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,990
She places an object
in a case.

769
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,500
The screen comes up.

770
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,370
Now comes the second object.

771
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,670
And the hand leaves.

772
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:14,930
OK.

773
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:15,880
The screen drops.

774
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,680
And there are two.

775
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,120
One plus one equals two.

776
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,520
And the infant goes,
OK, no big deal.

777
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,970
But if the screen drops and
there's one, the infant is

778
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:26,790
startled and looks longer.

779
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,130
And they can do it the
other way around.

780
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:30,430
They can do subtraction
as well.

781
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,920
So one plus one equals two, and
if there's one left by the

782
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,080
trickery of the kind you saw
earlier, they're disturbed

783
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,330
that the addition has not
occurred correctly.

784
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:41,290
Or the subtraction has not
occurred correctly.

785
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:45,210
And there's kind of a debate--
this is the last slide--

786
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:48,800
and here's the core idea,
though, which is this.

787
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,840
That our minds afford us, by
evolution, counting up to

788
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,690
about four objects
in the world.

789
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:56,990
And many animals do
that as well.

790
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:00,060
That sort of has to develop a
little bit, but we've at lot

791
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,570
running in us.

792
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:02,970
So that infants can do.

793
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:06,020
Because, of course, if you show
7-- if you give 77 booms,

794
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:09,540
they don't look for the display
with 77 versus 78.

795
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,030
They can't do that.

796
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:14,550
So they can operate in the world
of 1 to 3 or 1 to 4.

797
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,790
And then they discovered--

798
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:19,350
there's been a series of studies
in tribes, that are

799
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:22,060
relatively isolated in different
parts of the world,

800
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:25,290
where in their language they
only have words for

801
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:26,950
one, two, and three.

802
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:29,050
And everything after that
is really described as

803
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:30,680
many, or a whole lot.

804
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,155
They don't have words
for five and up.

805
00:32:33,155 --> 00:32:35,630
There's no word in
their language.

806
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:38,170
Because they've never needed it,
apparently, in the worlds

807
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:39,240
they live in.

808
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,140
So they go to them and
they have them do

809
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,150
little counting tasks.

810
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:46,130
And as soon as they get beyond
about four they get very

811
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,930
inaccurate.

812
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:51,340
It's as if the mind naturally
can represent about four

813
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:54,660
things in the object world, four
things in the counting

814
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,420
world-- maybe because
of that--

815
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:59,920
and after that everything is a
cultural invention of higher

816
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,200
level mathematics.

817
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,020
It builds off one to four.

818
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,830
But you don't have it
unless your culture

819
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,030
teaches it to you.

820
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:09,250
Or your culture invents it.

821
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,460
And there's been brain imaging
studies too, suggesting that

822
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:14,570
counting one to four is very
different in the brain than

823
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:17,330
exact mathematics beyond the
number four or five.

824
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:20,940
That's all culturally learned
and invented.

825
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,180
It's based on an innate
one to four capacity.

826
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,587
