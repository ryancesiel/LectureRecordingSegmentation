00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:29,330

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,580
PROFESSOR: Good afternoon.

11
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,560

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,930
In the last lecture we talked
about the remarkable human

13
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,937
brain, and how it empowers our
thoughts, or feelings, or

14
00:00:39,937 --> 00:00:42,920
desires, or actions in the
world, and how we began to

15
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,376
understand this remarkable
complexity, or at least grasp

16
00:00:46,376 --> 00:00:47,798
something of the complexity.

17
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:51,890
How we understand the potential
for things like

18
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,570
moral character,
and judgments.

19
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,250
The case of Phineas Gage, to
produce language, to speak our

20
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,250
feelings and thoughts that's
blocked in a patient like

21
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:03,350
Broca's patient, with
Broca's aphasia.

22
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,650
We talked about the fact that
split brain patients show us

23
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,550
not only to the left and right
hemispheres of the human brain

24
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:13,130
mediate separate mental
abilities, but that they also

25
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,220
seem to have almost independent
forms of

26
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,070
consciousness, or they
don't have to be

27
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,580
aware of one another.

28
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,670
And so my focus today is to say
we would learn from very

29
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,480
unusual clinical cases.

30
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,250
And I'm going to focus today on
tools we have to study the

31
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,580
typical human brain.

32
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:34,860
And what is it that we can do to
understand how your brain--

33
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,060
without having a

34
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,830
hemispherectomy or a big stroke--

35
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,380
how does it operate, and what
are the principles of human

36
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,280
brain function they gave
rise to the human mind?

37
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,260
So what are the ways we can
learn about the human brain?

38
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,370
And one thing we can't do is
when animal researchers can

39
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,510
do, we can't literally go inside
the brain except in

40
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,280
very rare clinical situations.

41
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,460
I'll talk about them, but it's
a rare source of evidence.

42
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,390
So there's a million ways in
which are trying to understand

43
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,190
which part of the brain is which
part of the mind, and we

44
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:07,280
talked about the fact that
phronology was a big misstep

45
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,990
in assigning the functions of
mental life to different parts

46
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:11,750
of the brain.

47
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,990
And so we hope we can do
a bit better than that.

48
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:17,030
And I'm going to review with
you today some of the core

49
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,620
methods, and there's
a number of them

50
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,250
studying the human brain.

51
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,130
The reason there's a number
is none of them

52
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,560
are the magic answer.

53
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,470
All of them are limited in their
own ways, and we sort of

54
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,630
need all of them to begin
to grasp how your

55
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,830
brain makes your mind.

56
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,210
There's three huge ways in which
we now have the human

57
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,990
brain organized.

58
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,690
Lesions, injuries to the brain,
stimulation when you're

59
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,390
allowed to stimulate
the brain--

60
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,140
rarer, but we'll talk
about that.

61
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,330
And the most common, the one you
see all the time in books

62
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,360
and magazines, recording,
functional MRI, EEG, methods

63
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,750
where we record brain
activity, and try to

64
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,800
understand how that relates to
the life of the human mind.

65
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,400
And so we're going to go through
these things a little

66
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,800
bit and show you how they're
applied in some ways that I

67
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,600
hope that you'll find
interesting.

68
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,100
We'll come back to many of these
things as we go through

69
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,080
the semester, and as we talk
about aging, or child

70
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,040
development, or personality,
or other

71
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,300
topics, social cognition.

72
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,980
We'll use these tools to
understand the brain bases of

73
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,690
those kinds of aspects
of our mental lives.

74
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,010
So what's a big injury
you can have?

75
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,470
You can have a stroke, where
tissue in the brain no longer

76
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,030
receives its vascular supply
that it depends on so greatly.

77
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,980
And a lot of different things
like hypoxia, lack of oxygen,

78
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,310
the brain is very sensitive
to oxygen.

79
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,030
Tumors can grow, you could have
degenerative disorders

80
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,120
like Alzheimer's, Huntington's,
Parkinson's, and

81
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,190
others, epilepsy.

82
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,010
So there's lots of different
ways in which you can end up

83
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,740
with brain injury, and
ultimately neuronal death.

84
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,460

85
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,050
What's the strength of this
form of evidence?

86
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,940
Well first of all,
it's causal.

87
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,880
We've talked about the
difference between causal and

88
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,260
correlational sources of
evidence, causal ones be more

89
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,980
powerful for scientific
explanation.

90
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,100
A certain part of the brain is
injured in you no longer can

91
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,180
speak, you change your
character, you no longer can

92
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,370
make memories.

93
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,600
We're pretty sure that part of
the brain in some way is

94
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,340
required, or causal, for
that part of your

95
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,300
mental life to operate.

96
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,090
The deficits you see following
brain injuries can be amazing,

97
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,480
we talked about Phineas Gage
changing his character, unable

98
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,820
to produce language, unable
to make new memories.

99
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,579
We'll talk a little bit about
patients with Prosopagnosia,

100
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:24,110
it's a good big word to go home
on spring break and if

101
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,570
your parents ask what have you
learned about, you say

102
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,270
Prosopagnosia.

103
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,730
That just means a deficit
in recognizing faces.

104
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,310
Patients with Prosopagnosia will
be unable to recognize

105
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,540
their own spouse
by their face.

106
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,720
They'll recognize it by the
voice, by the physical

107
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,780
movements, but not
by their face.

108
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,940
We learn amazing things about
the brain that until it

109
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,300
happens we didn't know that
could happen, what people like

110
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,370
to call counterintuitive.

111
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,020
So we'll talk later in the
course in a couple times about

112
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,420
blindsight, patients who say,
I see nothing, but their

113
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,850
behavior shows some part of
their brain sees something.

114
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,920
We'll talk about category
specific deficits where

115
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,900
patients all of the sudden can
no longer name living things,

116
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,100
but they can name nonliving
things.

117
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,220
So you wouldn't have
thought of that if

118
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,730
you didn't see that.

119
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,310
And we get separations
in the brain

120
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,090
between different things.

121
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,040
We talked about the difference
between the left hemisphere

122
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,840
being important for
local features,

123
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,250
the right for global.

124
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,320
The left thinking in terms of
functional things in the

125
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,320
world, the right in terms
of appearances.

126
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,780
We talked about that already.

127
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,150
We'll talk about other things,
the hippocampus is important

128
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:26,690
for knowing that, knowing a
piece of information but the

129
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,170
Basal Ganglia is important for
learning how to do things,

130
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,930
mental skills and
physical skills.

131
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,070
We'll come back to all of those,
it gives us way to

132
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,800
organize things.

133
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,170
Much of our most solid
understanding of the human

134
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,320
brain still comes from
the history of

135
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,170
neurology and lesions.

136
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,390
But what are its limitations?

137
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:46,500
First, brain injuries don't
follow anatomical boundaries,

138
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,630
they sort of crossover things
depending on the injury.

139
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,770
So they're not going to
selectively damage one part of

140
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,850
the brain and not touch an
adjacent one they could be

141
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,520
doing something different.

142
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,430
People can be variable
in their response.

143
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,150
Nearby systems, if you have two
things in the brain that

144
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,050
are next door to one another,
do quite different things.

145
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:09,170
Injuries are likely to injure
them both, and you will have a

146
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,930
wrong conclusion about
the architecture

147
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:13,280
of the human brain.

148
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,940
When we test a patient and ask
them to do things after a

149
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,910
brain injury, we don't really
test the part of the brain

150
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,390
that's not there.

151
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,340
We really test a part of the
brain that is there, people do

152
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,820
the best they can.

153
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,530
So there's secondary
degeneration to an injury,

154
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,930
there's recovery from
injury, there's

155
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,010
compensation from an injury.

156
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,650
When you test a patient with a
brain injury, you're testing

157
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,970
what the rest of the brain can
do in the absence of one of

158
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,820
its companions.

159
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,510
And finally can offer
limited views of

160
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,990
normal brain function.

161
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,200
Let me pick one and we'll
come back in the course.

162
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,320
We're very interested in
variation in people--

163
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,160
individuality--

164
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,340
what's the neurology
of individuality?

165
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,580
That's very hard to study in
lesion cases, because we don't

166
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,490
see enough of a lesion.

167
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,760
we don't have enough Phineas
Gages to ask would that injury

168
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,762
look different if you grew up in
one culture or another, if

169
00:07:00,762 --> 00:07:03,610
you were outgoing versus shy.

170
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,120
Those kinds of things
are very hard to

171
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,260
answer patient by patient.

172
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,080
But we can test large groups of
people with imaging and ask

173
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,940
what's the influence of
culture on your brain

174
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,860
organization?

175
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,985
What's the influence of
personality on how your

176
00:07:15,985 --> 00:07:16,690
brain's organized?

177
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,220
And you'll see later on in the
semester evidence about those

178
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,750
sorts of things.

179
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:25,650
So let's go back to Paul Broca,
the neurologist who

180
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,030
they gave a name to Broca's
area, because he sought a

181
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,220
patient like this,
like [INAUDIBLE].

182
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,630
That this patient had a big
injury in this area could no

183
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,510
longer speak.

184
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:36,100
And every course you ever take
about the brain almost will

185
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,370
include a discussion
about Broca's area.

186
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,570
So I'm going to warp your world
in a very narrow way,

187
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,330
but maybe a shocking way, and
tell you we don't even know

188
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,170
how to think about Broca's
area once we get more

189
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,860
scientific than that.

190
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,930
So because this is MIT
so we're willing to

191
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,100
tell the truth, OK.

192
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,780
So some years later Nina
Dronkers said the following

193
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,150
thing, she studied a large
group of patients who had

194
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,170
Broca's aphasia by behavior.

195
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:03,100
That is they had trouble
speaking, but the

196
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,160
comprehension was pretty good.

197
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,660
And then she made maps of
their injuries and she

198
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,050
overlaid those maps.

199
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,120
And she said who has Broca's
aphasia, and if you have

200
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,520
Broca's aphasia, what's the
one part of the brain that

201
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,690
every patient with Broca's
aphasia has damage to.

202
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,650
Because these patients--

203
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,090
what you see on these maps is,
some patients have damage

204
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,620
here, or here, or here.

205
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,220
But you line them all up and you
say, what's the one spot

206
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,179
that you have to have injured
to have Broca's aphasia?

207
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:35,549
And it's not this area that you
saw in the picture, it's

208
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:38,364
this area, in yellow, an area
called the Precentral Gyrus of

209
00:08:38,364 --> 00:08:39,975
the Insula.

210
00:08:39,975 --> 00:08:42,860
The Insula is a fascinating,
mysterious little structure--

211
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,490
you have one on the left,
and one on the right--

212
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,590
that runs along from the
temporal lobe, up to the

213
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,230
frontal cortex.

214
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,310
Just a couple years ago there
was a paper reporting that

215
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:54,860
patients who had stroke in
posterior insula instantly

216
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,670
gave up smoking, and never
wanted to smoke again.

217
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,120
There's huge research efforts
to help people quit smoking,

218
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,250
just because it's such a
difficult health problem.

219
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,520
Nobody is doing insula lesions
to help people

220
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,710
stop smoking, OK.

221
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:11,090
But it just stopped the smoking,
and their desire to

222
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,290
smoke, just like that.

223
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,770
This is now more towards the
front of the brain, this is

224
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:18,730
not what anybody in a book or
a course will tell you is

225
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,850
Broca's area, that's out here.

226
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,110
But it turns out this is the hot
spot, and you could say,

227
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,230
well what about the
original patient?

228
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,530
So kind of creatively Nina
Dronkers went back and they

229
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:31,285
did an MRI of the brain of the
deceased original Broca's

230
00:09:31,285 --> 00:09:32,910
aphasic patient.

231
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:36,150
They still had his brain, they
put it in a scanner and they

232
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,870
ran a structural MRI.

233
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,010
And what they found was sure
enough he had damage way

234
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:46,040
inside the exterior limit of
this damage, in as well as in

235
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,010
white matter that
connects to it.

236
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:51,740
So even now imaging evidence
lets us rediscover what is the

237
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,370
true basis of your ability
to speak, or its

238
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,840
vulnerability to injury.

239
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,520
And it turns out not
to be exactly what

240
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,300
Broca thought it was.

241
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,750
He saw big lesion and he said,
this is the part of matters.

242
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,870
It turns out, as far as we
understand, it's a slightly

243
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,700
different part that he thought
was just at the

244
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,440
edge and not important.

245
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,050
So we can get better even going
back to 150 years of

246
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:15,590
imaging a brain, we don't have
many of those brains around.

247
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,950
Stimulation, so you like to go
in the brain is stimulate.

248
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,260
People who do animal work will
go in and stimulate a neuron

249
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,860
and see what happens.

250
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,030
It's rare, you only get into the
patient's brain when they

251
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:28,440
have a neurosurgical procedure
and they're considering a

252
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,880
resection, or removal
of tissue.

253
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,820
You can also do recordings
by putting grids on

254
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,260
top of those brains.

255
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,610
And Penfield did famous studies
for patients with

256
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:40,230
epilepsy, where he would
stimulate and map things that

257
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,920
contributed a lot to our
thinking about the brain.

258
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,720
But that's a rare source of
evidence, as you can imagine.

259
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,630
Another one that's much more
common-- there's one of these

260
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,340
devices down the street
in building 46--

261
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:53,660
is Transcranial Magnetic
Stimulation, or TMS.

262
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,062
So this is one in which people
are allowed ethically, and

263
00:10:56,062 --> 00:10:58,980
responsibly to give you a
virtual lesion for a few

264
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,180
moments, if you volunteer
to do so.

265
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,990
So they put some sort of
wire, there's different

266
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08,460
configurations, over your head
in a targeted location.

267
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,642
It generates a magnetic field
that passes through the skull

268
00:11:10,642 --> 00:11:12,540
and induces a current.

269
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,050
And what happens is the
current drives lots

270
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,660
of neurons to fire.

271
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,440
Turns out, this is kind of
interesting, if all your

272
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,580
neurons are firing at the same
moment, in one sense it's as

273
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,420
if none of them were, because
there's no information.

274
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,810
There's a lot of different ways
you could think about

275
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:30,670
that, but for example if on your
300 channel television

276
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,030
you had all the channels on
simultaneously on the same

277
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,410
screen, it wouldn't be
very easy to watch,

278
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,180
something like that.

279
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,910
All the neurons firing pretty
much wipes out the

280
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,460
function of that area.

281
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:44,580
People do feel a little bit of
a physical sensation, if

282
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,360
you're prone to epilepsy it's
not a good idea to try this,

283
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,240
so it does require some
careful supervision

284
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:49,930
experimentally.

285
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,270
But you can do this with healthy
people, and if for

286
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:55,480
example you do it on this side
of the motor cortex, people

287
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,630
twitch or say they felt
somebody touch them.

288
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,220
Nobody touched them, but the
part of the brain that codes

289
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,510
for touch just got turned on.

290
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,900
If you put it on the occipital
cortex, visual cortex, and you

291
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,220
turn on at a certain moment,
you could put a word up and

292
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,690
word down, and the person will
say they saw nothing.

293
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,570
You'll make them functionally,
cortically

294
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,960
blind for a few moments.

295
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,430
People have done experiments
like this to suppress

296
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:20,140
activity, to enhance activity,
sometimes it makes people even

297
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,160
faster, like naming pictures.

298
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,550
And it's also been used there's
still experimental

299
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,310
studies of whether it can be
helpful for treatments of

300
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,870
neuropsychiatric disorders.

301
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,770
It's not invasive, in a sense of
you're not going literally

302
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:35,620
inside, you have a causal thing
because turning the

303
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,290
brain on or off.

304
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,530
It's not very well targeted, it
can't go into subcortical

305
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:45,270
areas, but it's a very
interesting tool.

306
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:48,670
Let's talk about recording brain
structure for a moment.

307
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,730
It's really important to
separate this concept between

308
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,400
recording structure, which is
a picture of anatomy, or

309
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,340
function, which is a picture
of physiology.

310
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,880
So there's old ones angiography,
and things like

311
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,940
that, I'll show you two.

312
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,410
Computed Tomography, and MR
and a really cool measure

313
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,650
called Diffusion
Tensor Imaging.

314
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,910
And then, dysfunctional
measures, and we'll talk about

315
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,710
those, EEG, PET, fMRI, MEG.

316
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,670
So here's some different
images you can

317
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,920
get from the brain.

318
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,650

319
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,120
This is a post-mortem brain,
this is a cut brain, here's

320
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,960
the front, here's the back.

321
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,000
If a brain was open in
front of you, this is

322
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,620
what you would see.

323
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,890
So here's an MRI, Magnetic
Resonance Imaging, and it's

324
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:29,120
pretty good, and I'll show you
some more pictures, in showing

325
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,070
you lots of information.

326
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,700
Not as good as if you were in
there, but pretty good.

327
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,120
Here's a CT scan, Computed
Tomography.

328
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,840
It's not as good, it's
more blurry.

329
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,430
And this thing that looks really
sad, it looks like get

330
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:43,810
your camera to focus, that's
actually the quality of the

331
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,040
picture that we see that
underlies maybe the most

332
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,290
widely used tool these days for
understanding the human

333
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,720
mind and brain, Functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

334
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,830
It's a very smudgy picture,
but it has some really

335
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,660
interesting properties.

336
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,970
So here's the kind of thing you
go into for an MRI, both

337
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,550
structural or functional.

338
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:03,040
Some of you have almost
certainly been participants in

339
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,690
research or experiments,
or studies, stick up

340
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:05,870
your hand if you have.

341
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:09,930
Oh, a lot of you, OK, so you'll
speak up on this, is it

342
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:12,110
quiet or noisy?

343
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:17,570
It's super noisy, so you have
to have ear plugs in.

344
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,980
And this is why people doing
experiments with this

345
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,320
Functional MRI want to do
visual studies, because

346
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,300
auditory ones are tricky.

347
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,030
So Tyler, your head TA, likes
auditory stuff, it's 10 times

348
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,420
harder to pull off those
experiments.

349
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,700
Everybody tries to do visual
stuff, so you don't have the

350
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,940
noise problem.

351
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,485
But you get some beautiful
pictures, here's Computed

352
00:14:33,485 --> 00:14:35,250
Tomography.

353
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,160
And here's an MRI structural
scan from the brain, the

354
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,500
ventricles, here's
Basal Ganglia.

355
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,000

356
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,570
With an MRI, beautifully you can
see the difference between

357
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,460
white and gray matter.

358
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,080
I'm always impressed that
the gray matter is

359
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,520
just this thin ribbon.

360
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,580
Cortex really means bark,
it's just like

361
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,860
the bark on our tree.

362
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,600
And when you look at the brain
this way, look at how much

363
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,350
white matter there is.

364
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,500
Here's your frontal cortex, look
at all that white matter

365
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,490
and then this thin, cortical
mantle, or ribbon, or bark.

366
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:06,070
That's what we think of as the
smarts of language, and social

367
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,380
planning, and things
like that.

368
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,970
So that's a structural
picture.

369
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,370
And then these two pictures
are sort of fun.

370
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:18,750
This is just recorded down the
street, we're going to fly

371
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:32,550
through your brain from
one ear to the other.

372
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:36,650

373
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,940
And you get amazing resolution,
it's not the same

374
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,230
thing like being inside
the brain.

375
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,890
There's things that you don't
see, we know that,

376
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:43,960
but you see a lot.

377
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,210
Isn't that cool?

378
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:49,770

379
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:52,640
Let's examine what
you can see now.

380
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,120
Only about 40 years ago, you
would have to have a person

381
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,970
die to see this.

382
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,540
This is a patient with
Huntington's disease, we'll

383
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,630
come back and talk about
that disorder.

384
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,770
Here's a healthy person,
top of the brain.

385
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,290
This is the caudate here, part
of the Basal Ganglia.

386
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,870
And you could see in a patient
who has passed away that part

387
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,850
of the brain is completely
withered away in

388
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:11,720
Huntington's disease.

389
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,530
You would have to wait until
person passed away to see

390
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,960
something like that.

391
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,640
Here's a healthy person
top of the brain,

392
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,140
again lining the ventricle.

393
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,310
This is the caudate.

394
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,160
And here in a living
Huntington's patients you can

395
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,490
see the great withering away.

396
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,110
Some of cortex 2 in later
stage of disease, but

397
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,360
especially in the
Basal Ganglia.

398
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,950

399
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:33,470
Here's a healthy older person,
about 70 years of age, top of

400
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,940
the brain, bottom of the
brain, the ventricle.

401
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,700
Here's on the left and right
of the hippocampus, the

402
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,900
structure we'll talk about,
without which you can cannot

403
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,870
learn any new fact,
or remember any

404
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,220
event in your life.

405
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,090
So powerful for almost every
sense of learning.

406
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,990
And look what happens the
structure in the same aged

407
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,510
patient with Alzheimer's
disease.

408
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:59,120
It's virtually gone, it's
greatly weathered.

409
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,190
You see it's much wider here,
because the tissue's greatly

410
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,290
shrunk in the Alzheimer's
patient.

411
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,599
So we can see these kinds of
changes in living people, for

412
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:12,089
both research purposes and
clinical purposes.

413
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:14,530
Here's one that's more cheerful,
and more reflecting

414
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,740
your experience.

415
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:20,400
Here are studies of brain
changes from age four to 21.

416
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,700
So they follow a large number
of people at NIH

417
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,890
from age four to 21.

418
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,940
And what this shows is this
color coding is the thickness

419
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,360
of the cortex.

420
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,810
And you might imagine that as
you get older, and smarter and

421
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,890
go through grade school, and
middle school, and high

422
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:37,340
school, and MIT college, and
as you head towards grad

423
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,960
school, your brain will
get thicker, and

424
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,290
thicker with cortex.

425
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,050
It's exactly the opposite.

426
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,950
Ever since you were about five
years old, you've been

427
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:48,280
shedding neurons by the
millions, and connections

428
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,980
among them by the trillions.

429
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,530
And you're still going
to do that until your

430
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,630
probably about 22 or 23.

431
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,930
Then you peak, and you decline
and become faculty members.

432
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:01,490

433
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,450
But that's really interesting,
we'll come back to this, that

434
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,750
what happens as your brain
get smart, experienced,

435
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,820
knowledgeable, all the
differences between you now,

436
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:14,390
if you're 17, 18, 19, 20, and
when you were four, it all

437
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:17,970
goes with your cortex
getting thinner.

438
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,690
And we'll come back to that
and how people think about

439
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:23,240
that, but let's see if I can
get this next movie to run.

440
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,930
There's also an ordering-- and
we'll come back this but I

441
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,640
want to show you this movie.

442
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,090
So the more blue you are, the
thinner you are, the more

443
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:31,670
advanced you are in terms
of ultimate young adult

444
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:32,900
development.

445
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,740
Here's visual cortex,
vision coming in.

446
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,150
This is Somatomotor Cortex, how
you feel, your body, and

447
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,580
how you move yourself.

448
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:44,200
And what you see is, as you go
from age four to 21, the blue

449
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,960
spreads, that spreading is your
brain maturing in higher

450
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,510
thought areas.

451
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:55,755
So we're going to review your
life on average right now,

452
00:18:55,755 --> 00:18:57,005
here you go.

453
00:18:57,005 --> 00:19:03,150

454
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:06,020
And now you're ready
to graduate.

455
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,540
It's kind of an amazing story
of fantastic brain changes

456
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,240
that move you from what you
could do and not do at four,

457
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,910
to what you can do and
not do at age 21.

458
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:18,600
And we couldn't see these
things, we couldn't begin to

459
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,230
see these things, until just
a few years ago in any

460
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,360
scientific sense.

461
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,990
All these things are like
miraculous sources of

462
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,540
information.

463
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,080
So let's pick another
thing, and we'll tie

464
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,620
it to school work.

465
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,300
Here's the structure we
said, the hippocampus.

466
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:36,790
So important for the formation
of new memories on an everyday

467
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:40,210
basis, everything that's
important and that you learn.

468
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:43,060
So here's a fun study they
took, and as you hear it,

469
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,130
think about its scientific
limitation, but it's fun as

470
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,740
students to think about.

471
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,900
They looked at students in
medical school in Germany.

472
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,080
They looked at the measure of
an anatomic thickness of the

473
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,790
hippocampus before and after
they studied like crazy for a

474
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,600
huge exam over some
number of periods.

475
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,330

476
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,260
This is the difference between
the two, and what they're

477
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,650
showing you is that as you
study, your hippocampus got

478
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,980
thicker as you crammed
for your test.

479
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,350
So will there be a day where
instead of having to give you

480
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,910
tests we could just measure
the thickness of your

481
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,910
hippocampus to know how much
you studied, and you could

482
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,520
just zoom in and out of a
scanner, I don't know.

483
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,660
But one cool thing about it is
it's showing you that we can

484
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,950
see structural changes not just
on a giant scale from

485
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,990
when you're four to 21, but from
some number of months of

486
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:34,770
experience, we can see a
physical change in your brain.

487
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:37,100
Now that's trivial for animal
researchers, they can show

488
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,410
amazing things in seconds, but
you see the human brain

489
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,740
physically changing.

490
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,870
So let's take a look at another
one, slightly more

491
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:47,590
controlled, we'll look
at two more examples.

492
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,850
London taxi cab drivers.

493
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,650
If you've travelled in various
cities, and have gone in

494
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:55,370
various taxis, you may have
had better or worse

495
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,630
experiences whether the taxi
driver knows where he or she

496
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:58,720
is going exactly.

497
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,120
London is famous for having a
very high code, taxi drivers

498
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:07,650
have to take big exams to get
their official taxi license,

499
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,980
they create a very
demanding thing.

500
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,020
And when they ask this in the
hippocampus if you learn lots

501
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,315
of routes, if you know tons of
routes in London, what happens

502
00:21:16,315 --> 00:21:18,100
to the hippocampus as
it's memorizing all

503
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,170
these special routes?

504
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:23,180
And what they saw, that taxi
drivers had bigger hippocampi,

505
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:27,660
and the longer they drove,
the bigger it was.

506
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,830
So is this a causal or

507
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,085
correlational source of evidence?

508
00:21:30,085 --> 00:21:33,050

509
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:35,490
It's correlational right?

510
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,560
So let's start with this, they
have bigger hippocampi, and

511
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,870
now maybe that's simply
because, what?

512
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:43,300
Maybe somebody who has an
awesome hippocampus is ready

513
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,940
to go to be a taxi driver.

514
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,630
Maybe they pass the test, and
the one who got lost all the

515
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,940
time, and was driving to the
wrong airport and stuff, small

516
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,080
hippocampus, never became
a taxi driver.

517
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,290
So the size of the hippocampus
is the cause of your success,

518
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,660
not the consequence.

519
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,560
Because the longer you drove,
the bigger it got, that kind

520
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,960
of goes with that.

521
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,620
But you could do a causal
experiment this way.

522
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,280
They taught people to juggle
three balls, they practiced

523
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,470
every day for three months.

524
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,760
Three months juggling
every day.

525
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,413
What you see in yellow are parts
of the brain-- that's a

526
00:22:15,413 --> 00:22:17,400
statistical map--

527
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,260
parts of the brain that
significantly got thicker in

528
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,295
three months of practice.

529
00:22:22,295 --> 00:22:24,730
So they could compare directly
before and after, it's a

530
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:27,050
causal experiment.

531
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:30,730
And these are areas that are
involved in the visual motion,

532
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:34,190
and it makes sense that areas
involved in visual motion

533
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,140
would somehow change.

534
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,490
But the fact that we can see
three months of experience

535
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,340
change the structure of your
brain, it's kind of remarkable

536
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,580
in they way that we can measure
and scientifically

537
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,760
scrutinize.

538
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,550
You might be curious if you did
three months of this and

539
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,150
you were a pretty good juggler,
you're impressing

540
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:51,700
your friends at parties, your
brain scan is different.

541
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,790
What do you think happened--

542
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:55,070
they followed these people
up-- after the juggling

543
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,150
requirements stopped?

544
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,490
They kind of stop, most of the
people, they were too busy.

545
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:01,300
They would show off here and
there, but that was it.

546
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,060
They measured their brain's
again about six months later,

547
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,890
and this change was gone.

548
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:09,210
It came in, and it went out
with the activity, it's

549
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,210
activity dependent.

550
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:13,710
So depending on what you do,
you could think about every

551
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:16,090
activity you do-- mental and
physical that you do-- is

552
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,710
constantly slightly changing
your brain.

553
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:21,440
And if you do a lot of it,
you're fundamentally changing

554
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,510
it like in these individuals.

555
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,320
But if you stop doing it you
go right back to where you

556
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,460
were, because you're going to
be doing something else.

557
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,210
And another fun measure that's
kind of beautiful and

558
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,110
intriguing is Diffusion
Tensor Imaging.

559
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,020
Now every [INAUDIBLE] we talked
about so far has been

560
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,470
gray matter of the brain,
the neurons and then the

561
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,820
circuits they form.

562
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,310
We're going to turn to white
matter, which is the

563
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:44,720
myelinated axons that are
the super conducting

564
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,750
highways of the brain.

565
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,270
And what Diffusion Tensor
Imaging does, it shows you

566
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,100
something about the organization
of that white

567
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:55,360
matter, measuring directly the
movement of water at very,

568
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,850
very tiny distances.

569
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:01,740
This is a cross-section of
a myelinated nerve fiber.

570
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,170
Those are the fibers that are
covered with white matter that

571
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,550
have to go some distance.

572
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:08,470
And the myelin protects the
quality and speed of that

573
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,310
signal through your brain.

574
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:13,000
And you could see at the level
of, if you're a tiny, tiny

575
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,570
drop of water, or smaller than
that, this is a pretty big

576
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:18,670
bump in the road.

577
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:21,770
So imagine you're a little drop
of water moving a little

578
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:24,530
bit, and you bump up against the
myelin, you go oh, can't

579
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,200
go that way, and you go
back this way, and

580
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,005
you go with the flow.

581
00:24:27,005 --> 00:24:30,180
You go parallel with a myelin,
it's hard to cross it at that

582
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,000
microscopic scale.

583
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,360
But we can measure that movement
in areas where it's

584
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,290
highly constrained, and that's
a property of the water.

585
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,980
Here cerebral spinal fluid,
things can go anywhere.

586
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,970
Here's where there's a lot of
white matter, and the water

587
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:46,930
tends to flow along parallel
with the white matter, just

588
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:49,960
for physical reasons it
can't cross it over.

589
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,530
And here for example, is a
statistical map comparing this

590
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:57,760
measure of white matter
organization between adults,

591
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,780
who either in their childhood
had a diagnosis of dyslexia,

592
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:04,060
reading was difficult for
these individuals.

593
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:07,370
Or people who typical reading
development, where you learned

594
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,440
to read and wasn't particularly
difficult.

595
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,610
And you can see that in this
area around the Temporal

596
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,670
Parietal Cortex, there's a
significant difference.

597
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:17,400
But we can do one more thing.

598
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,540
These are reading scores this
way, this is the measure of

599
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,110
the white matter organization
from the

600
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,970
Diffusion Tensor Imaging.

601
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:26,630
Each of these as an individual
person now.

602
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:29,380
So the open dots are the people
who had typical reading

603
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,940
development.

604
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:34,550
The filled dots are the people
who had poor development, and

605
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,600
you can see it's pretty
continuous.

606
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,950
Even in the people with the open
circles who never had a

607
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:42,280
problem, the better they
read, the more the

608
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,930
organization is here.

609
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,570
So this is not just the
difference between good and

610
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:50,040
bad readers, it's a difference
between really good readers,

611
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,710
and medium readers, and poor
readers, right, continuous.

612
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,000
So now, cause or effect?

613
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,630

614
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:00,180
Were those of you who at three,
who had awesome myelin,

615
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,480
were you going, reading's
a snap.

616
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,880
I love this stuff, where's
War and Peace, mom?

617
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,960
Or, were you like the jugglers,
and you were reading

618
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,210
a lot, and you were exercising
this part of the brain, and

619
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:15,240
altered its physical
structure.

620
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,200
And the answer is
we don't know.

621
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,080
How could we know?

622
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,330
How could we know?

623
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,350

624
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:26,400
If you were scientists and were
given a pot of money to

625
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,010
do this, how could you know?

626
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:30,670
Well--

627
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:31,679
yeah?

628
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,170
AUDIENCE: Track the entire
lives of multiple people.

629
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,590
PROFESSOR: Yeah, do a
longitudinal study and start

630
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:40,190
like, before people read.

631
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,950
And you could see is
it different then?

632
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:47,130
Are we born to be big readers,
or by being big readers do we

633
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:50,740
alter the architecture
our brain.

634
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,510
What's the effort, and what's
the talent, or what's the

635
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:56,350
predisposition at birth, and
what's the time you put in

636
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,010
creating this part.

637
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:00,500
We don't know that yet, but we
have a place to look at that.

638
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,940
And then you can create these
kinds of beautiful pictures,

639
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,240
and I'll say a word
about this.

640
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,350
So this is an individual
person's white matter

641
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,910
organization.

642
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:10,150
So we could take this picture
of you, or anybody you know

643
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,870
who wants to go in a scanner.

644
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:16,450
And what's color coded here in
blue are fibers that are

645
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:19,690
running up or down, we can't
tell with the fibers which

646
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:22,110
direction they're going,
but we can tell other

647
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:22,850
orientations.

648
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:26,150
Up and down, left and right in
red, up and down in blue, and

649
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,400
green is front to back.

650
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,470

651
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,320
Pretty cool, huh?

652
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,146
I can tell you that I'll
say a word about this.

653
00:27:35,146 --> 00:27:40,750

654
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,000
Should we do that again?

655
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,480

656
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,180
I like it, but I work
in this area.

657
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,700

658
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,210
This is fantastic, this is an
individual person's white

659
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:54,050
matter organization.

660
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:56,750
As information is flowing around
in your mind, here's

661
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,520
the paths that it's flowing
around in as you just do

662
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,790
anything that's interesting
in your feelings

663
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,440
or thoughts or anything.

664
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,250
It's fantastic.

665
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:08,840
I can tell you that the
algorithms that are used to

666
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,450
create these maps, there's
some debate

667
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:11,880
about the better ones.

668
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,990
So the last steps of this are
a bit debated, and a bit

669
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:19,570
depending on how cool you are
as a visual engineer.

670
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:21,310
But there's a lot of things
that's right about Diffusion

671
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:24,340
Tensor Imaging, there's
a lot of things that

672
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,590
are right about it.

673
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:28,280

674
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:32,870
Function, so most of all we're
interested in structure, not

675
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:36,510
just for itself, but how is it
makes your mind do the things

676
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,490
you could do.

677
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,290
And when we think about
different functional measures

678
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,930
that are available to
neuroscientists or

679
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:44,047
psychologists, we often think
in two dimensions, Spatial

680
00:28:44,047 --> 00:28:47,100
Resolution, and Temporal
Resolution.

681
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,370
How precise are we where we are,
and what's the time scale

682
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:54,150
that we're measuring in,
milliseconds, are we averaging

683
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,460
over many seconds, many hours.

684
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:00,020
We know mental operations,
roughly speaking, occur at the

685
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,640
millisecond level, or maybe
10 milliseconds.

686
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,260
There's no answer to that, but
we know lots of things happen

687
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,020
that fast in the mind.

688
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:10,410
So if you look at this here you
can see that, for example,

689
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,880
if you're in animal work,
looking at size, you can get

690
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,730
down to the Synapse
or the Dendrite.

691
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:17,980
We can't touch that in humans,
we can't touch

692
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,660
that cellular stuff.

693
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:23,010
And it's not until we get up
to here, which is like big

694
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:26,720
patches of the brain, that we
can state things about people.

695
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,530
That's why it's always going
to be fundamental in

696
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:31,590
neuroscience to link the human
work to the animal work,

697
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:34,620
because we can't get to the
neurons or anything like that

698
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,210
in a person almost ever.

699
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,900
That has to come from animal
work, where you can do

700
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,030
invasive work.

701
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,630
So we have to look at
a pretty big patches

702
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:42,830
of the human brain.

703
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,040
How about time?

704
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,950
Well, we can get down to
milliseconds in time in the

705
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:47,910
human brain.

706
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:51,190
Functional things like PET and
MRI are here and in the order

707
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:53,850
of multiple seconds, I'll
come back to this.

708
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:55,360
But you can see all these
things have strengths.

709
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,690
Now you don't always want to be
down to a single synapse,

710
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,870
it's not clear that we would
understand much of the

711
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:04,500
organization of the brain at
the level of the synapse.

712
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,510
There's things happening in the
synapse, but a thing like

713
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,650
knowledge, or love, or something
like that probably

714
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:11,240
we can't study at the level
of the synapse.

715
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,590
Effectively, yet.

716
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:15,290
Bigger units are probably
more interpretable.

717
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:18,180
So here's a fun one, EEG's,
Electroencephalography.

718
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:22,370
So they put on your head some
sort of a cap with electrodes,

719
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:25,760
and they measure changes in
electrical activity that are

720
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,070
being picked up through
the skull.

721
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:30,860
And you're picking up huge
changes in hundreds of

722
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,510
thousands of neurons, but
you're able to do it

723
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:35,950
millisecond by millisecond
at the speed of thought.

724
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:39,410

725
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:42,270
The same electrical signal for
EEG and ERP, that evoke

726
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:46,280
response potentials, with EEG
you just watch it over time.

727
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:49,210
So you can see these different
rhythms that go with a person

728
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:53,870
in coma, or in deep sleep,
asleep, drowsy, relaxed.

729
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:56,480
You can see these characteristic
rhythms that

730
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,190
people can measure.

731
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:02,480
If you do an experiment, you can
time lock these moment by

732
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,140
moment to some stimulus or
task you give the person.

733
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,800
So here we're going to time lock
these, and then you get a

734
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,470
thing like this that says,
here's a response, maybe the

735
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:14,220
first moment after I see a word,
a second moment after I

736
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,050
see a word or something
like that.

737
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:18,430
So you can time lock
large electrical

738
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:20,890
responses in the brain.

739
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,550
And you get some studies like
this, and we'll come back to

740
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:26,030
this, but here's a fun one
in language for example.

741
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:30,270
You read a sentence like, It was
his first day at work, OK

742
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,850
that's the baseline condition in
purple, not a particularly

743
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,195
exciting sentence.

744
00:31:34,195 --> 00:31:35,730
Although, your first day at
work is actually pretty

745
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:38,140
interesting-- but to
read the sentence.

746
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:41,090
How about this one: He spread
the warm bread with socks.

747
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,130
You go, Socks?

748
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:44,280
I'm shocked, that makes
no sense at all.

749
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,350
What happens as you read it,
here's in broken blue line,

750
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:50,670
you go wow, and that's
called the N400.

751
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:53,730
But that's kind of cool, that's
400 milliseconds after

752
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:56,100
you saw that word you said, I
get it's socks but it doesn't

753
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:56,960
make sense.

754
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,180
So you're violating semantics.

755
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,920
And then they have to do
a control experiment.

756
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,050
And a lot of psychology, in a
course like this, we can't

757
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:06,950
devote enough time to this.

758
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:09,720
But I can tell you high quality
research in psychology

759
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,170
is high quality thoughtfulness
like in any other field.

760
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:15,580
You could say, well maybe it's
not the word "socks" that's

761
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:19,220
bothering you, maybe just
because it's odd, just like a

762
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:22,260
weirded out signal, it's
a weirded out signal.

763
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:25,070
So they do this, She put on
her high-heeled shoes, but

764
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,970
they put shoes in big print
that you didn't expect.

765
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:30,650
So now you're weirded out,
but it makes sense.

766
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,540
So what happens in your
mind, you a very

767
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,320
different response here.

768
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,700
So here the meaning is wrong,
here the size is wrong.

769
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,950
And see you can read a person's
mind in this sense,

770
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:42,650
millisecond by millisecond as
they understand something like

771
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:44,420
a sentence.

772
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,500
You can do it with babies,
which is pretty cute, and

773
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,410
incredibly exciting too.

774
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:51,230
So we can measure to
the milliseconds.

775
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:53,420
Lots of people can take doing
it, it's relatively

776
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,720
inexpensive.

777
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,550
Why don't we just run
around and do that?

778
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:59,060
And we do that at MIT, and lots
of places do this too.

779
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,000
Well, Spatial Resolution is
really problematic, we don't

780
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,230
know where in the brain
the signals are

781
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,070
really coming from.

782
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:08,060
We know where the electrode
is on the head, but that's

783
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,330
picking up a lot of stuff below
it, we don't know where

784
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:12,010
the brain is coming from.

785
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:14,050
The way I think about it a
little bit, imagine you went

786
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:16,000
to a football game, and you
were on the outside of the

787
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,410
stadium, and you heard big
cheering on the side that you

788
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:20,150
knew was MIT.

789
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:22,270
You might think something good
happened to MIT, then you hear

790
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:25,340
big cheering on the side where
CalTech team is sitting, and

791
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,310
there's fans, it'd be
the usual Rose Bowl.

792
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:32,010

793
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,755
You might figure something good
happened at CalTech, but

794
00:33:33,755 --> 00:33:35,510
you don't really know exactly
what happened, and exactly

795
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,380
where it happened.

796
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,230
So we don't know where the
signals are coming from in a

797
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:42,560
very precise way.

798
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,770
There's another method that's
sort of very intriguing too,

799
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:47,260
and we're just installing it
at MIT, and you could be

800
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,240
amongst the first generation
of participants, if you so

801
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,380
choose to be.

802
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:53,330
This is called
Magnetoencephalography, active

803
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:55,230
neurons produce small
magnetic fields.

804
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:58,630
You can use a superconducting
quantum device to measure this

805
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:01,210
tiny, tiny change to the
magnetic field, they're

806
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:03,400
secondary to the
neurons firing.

807
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,390
These signals are problematic
to measure because they're

808
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:08,900
estimated to be 100 million
times smaller than the earth's

809
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,710
magnetic field.

810
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:13,389
And all these measures we have
in human brain function, all

811
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:16,650
of them, the signal is terrible
compared to the

812
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:19,270
noise, it's terrible compared
to the noise.

813
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,710
And MEG might be the worst,
there's a number of places

814
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:25,750
that installed MEG, and had to
take it out because the local

815
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:29,270
traffic on the road was too big
relative to the difference

816
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:31,620
between the earth's magnetic
field in the signal they get.

817
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:34,920
Signal to noise is terrible in
every noninvasive human brain

818
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,250
measure we have.

819
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,889
But you get something
beautiful.

820
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:42,230
Now, any mental thought we have
of any interest of any

821
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:45,370
kind, we pretty much understand
to be the property

822
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:48,150
not of a single part of the
brain doing its thing, but a

823
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:52,210
remarkable concert, different
parts of your brain playing or

824
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,750
interacting with one another.

825
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,920
It's a symphony orchestra doing
anything interesting in

826
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,180
the human mind, and MEG can
show that beautifully.

827
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,770
So here's an individual's
structural MRI that's been

828
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:05,070
inflated, they've sort of blown
it out like a balloon so

829
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,400
it's sort of easy to look at.

830
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,360
And what you're going to see now
from Dale & Halgren in an

831
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,520
MEG measurement millisecond by
millisecond of what your brain

832
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,550
does, roughly speaking, when
you read a single word, OK

833
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,800
here we go.

834
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,110

835
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:24,490
See, back and forth, back and
forth, and there's all this

836
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:27,050
interaction feeding forward from
when you see it, feeding

837
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:29,040
being backward from parts of
your brain that say, I think I

838
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,970
know what it is, let's
double check.

839
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,040
Back and forth, back
and forth.

840
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,080
Let me do it one more time,
because I think

841
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,920
it's just so cool.

842
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,580
Anything interesting that your
brain does is an incredibly

843
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:43,070
complicated millisecond by
millisecond interaction

844
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:45,810
between large scale
brain networks.

845
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,620
So here we go again, reading a
single word, arrives in the

846
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,340
back of the brain, front's
thinking about back, front,

847
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,210
back, front, back front.

848
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:53,460
We read the word.

849
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,350

850
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:59,280
It's just amazing, and MEG is
one of the better measures for

851
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,470
us to see this time based
way in which your mind

852
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:03,720
accomplishes things.

853
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,030

854
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:09,070
The strengths are it has great
temporal resolution,

855
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:12,600
noninvasive, Spatial Resolution
is it maybe better

856
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,510
than EEG, or perhaps better, not
as good as a fMRI, we'll

857
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,470
come to that.

858
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:20,200
And it only can measure neurons
in the cortex that are

859
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,900
parallel to the skull, so we
can't see lots of things like

860
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,385
support local structures
like the hippocampus.

861
00:36:24,385 --> 00:36:27,160

862
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,410
So now we're moving to the
measures that you most often

863
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:32,080
see, but these other ones
all help us a lot.

864
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,280
And they are all derived from
the following things.

865
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,400
Sadly, for PET or fMRI, the most
widely used studies to

866
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,170
understand how your mind works,
we can't interrogate

867
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:44,650
the neurons to compute your
mind, we can't, they're off

868
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:46,050
bounds to us.

869
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:48,810
The other measures you just
saw are based on neurons.

870
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:51,690
What we have to do is we have to
look for gossipy neighbors,

871
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:54,440
that is the vasculature that
surrounds and supports the

872
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,500
neurons that compute the mind.

873
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,470
And we know the neurons require
oxygen and glucose,

874
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:02,860
metabolically to do their
work, the cellular life.

875
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:05,190
And the brain area's active,
there's increased blood flow,

876
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,900
and increased energy supplies
that come to that.

877
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,790
So it's all the sort of
inference by the secondary

878
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:13,270
consequence of neurons
doing their business.

879
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:16,310
So the brain is about 3 and 1/2
pounds, it's about 2% of

880
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:18,310
your total body mass.

881
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:22,980
So it has a tenfold, 20% extra
demand of body oxygen, your

882
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,880
brain cries out for oxygen
at every moment.

883
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,390
So 2% of your body, but 20%
of the oxygen demand.

884
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:32,060
And it's so sensitive that only
10 minutes of loss of

885
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:35,260
oxygen can often cause
irreversible brain damage,

886
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,950
especially in structures
like the hippocampus.

887
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:40,370

888
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:46,030
The first discovery that blood
changes that are going with

889
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,150
brain changes, blood changes
that are the sort of the

890
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:52,240
echoes, if you will, a secondary
consequence, is low

891
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,360
tech character current
machines.

892
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,140
This is work from Angelo Mosso
in the late 1880's, and he saw

893
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:00,105
a patient who had a unusual sort
of malformation, so he

894
00:38:00,105 --> 00:38:02,950
had almost no skull here.

895
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,970
And he put on it something that
measured the pressure

896
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:09,760
there, and he also measured--
and what's shown here in red

897
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,690
is this pressure as a control
thing, that's pretty clever--

898
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:19,890
pulses of blood in the forearm,
so those are in blue.

899
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:22,850
That's the control, that's not
just blood everywhere.

900
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:24,770
And what he did is, the guy's
still sitting there, nothing

901
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:28,070
happening, and he noticed that
when the church bells rang

902
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:33,660
nearby, boom, this device picked
up increased pressure

903
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,960
over this part of the head.

904
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,530
That's pretty cool, it has to
be blood, it's not neurons,

905
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:39,260
OK, it's blood.

906
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:43,560
But now he has the signature of
mental life in your brain,

907
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,520
the blood consequence
of a thought, which

908
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,970
is I hear the Church.

909
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:48,850
They asked the guy, does it have
to be something that you

910
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:50,740
hear, he says, did you
make your prayers

911
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,060
today, your Ave Maria?

912
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,620
Again nothing happening
peripherally, but boom, as he

913
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:57,730
gives his answer, a change
in blood pressure there.

914
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:01,800
Or do math problem, boom,
a change there.

915
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,380
So all of the sudden, blood
changes of a part of the brain

916
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:08,120
become the witness to that part
of the brain supporting

917
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:11,110
the mental operations
to do that task.

918
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:13,513
And here's a PET study, the
first weighted Positron

919
00:39:13,513 --> 00:39:16,400
Emission Tomography, which is
basically used to measure

920
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,280
local brain activity by looking
at the consequences of

921
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,590
photons disintegrating as
they're measured in this sort

922
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,090
of a device.

923
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:27,860
And here's the way they use this
task to discover which

924
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:30,370
parts to map the neural
organization

925
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,040
of the human mind.

926
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,140
So I need somebody who's willing
to do a task at their

927
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:38,460
seat, and it's just going to be
reading words, or coming up

928
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,560
with words.

929
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,240
OK, thanks.

930
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,330
Here you go, ready?

931
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:45,560
Look at that, in our field we
call that fixation, you're

932
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,330
just looking, OK,
just looking.

933
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:48,720
Alright, good job.

934
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,750
Ready for something else?

935
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:52,830
Alright, now just look
at these things,

936
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,260
OK, you see the words?

937
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,670
The technical word is reading.

938
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:59,030
Alright, now imagine we did one
more thing with you-- and

939
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,130
actually if you were
in a PET scanner

940
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:00,940
here's what would happen.

941
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,510
If in a PET scanner, you'd be
sitting down there like that,

942
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:06,070
there'd be a physician in their
lab coat like this.

943
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,460
There'd be physicist in the
basement making up some sort

944
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:13,110
of a tracer they're going
to inject into you

945
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:16,330
every round of this.

946
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,470
Because that's what they need to
sort of track this, and it

947
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:20,690
comes up an elevator, and people
take turns running down

948
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:23,180
the hall with it, because it has
a pretty short half-life.

949
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,915
The shortness of its half-life
is what makes you able to do

950
00:40:25,915 --> 00:40:27,300
these multiple measures.

951
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,200
This is a pretty big deal
process, and in fact the one

952
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,935
or two PET sessions I ever
attended, you would rotate who

953
00:40:32,935 --> 00:40:35,360
would run down the field with
the radioactive substance, so

954
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,490
you would share the radioactive
substance.

955
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:41,840

956
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,540
So now you've done that, and
you feel like, I'm doing

957
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,050
pretty good.

958
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:44,940
So now they come and
they say, are you

959
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:45,960
ready for another injection?

960
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,010
They have a catheter running
into your arm, and they inject

961
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:50,870
you again, here comes the
radioactive stuff, the oxygen.

962
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:54,440
And now they ask you to read the
words aloud presented one

963
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,330
at a time, why don't you
just read aloud one

964
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:57,411
at a time, go ahead.

965
00:40:57,411 --> 00:40:59,616
AUDIENCE: Rose, cat,
apple, pen, plane.

966
00:40:59,616 --> 00:41:01,553
PROFESSOR: OK, and they say
thank you very much, and we're

967
00:41:01,553 --> 00:41:03,510
going to do one more injection
if that's OK with you, of

968
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,430
radioactive substance.

969
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,070
And now we're going to ask you
to do one thing, and this is

970
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:11,490
harder, as you see each word
tell us a verb that describes

971
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:13,710
what you might do with that
object, or what a person might

972
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:16,110
do, so go ahead, for
rose tell us.

973
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:19,519
AUDIENCE: Smell, pet,
eat, write, fly.

974
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:20,670
PROFESSOR: Perfect.

975
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,490
Yeah, I can tell you that in the
experiment they present a

976
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:24,190
lot of these, and a lot of
subjects after while just go

977
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:29,800
use, use, use, use, hold,
hold, hold, hold.

978
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,050
But you did a good job, OK.

979
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:33,240

980
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,040
This is just looking at
something, this is looking at

981
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,900
a word, which is reading.

982
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:39,890
Now don't forget, we're the only
species that ever read,

983
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:43,050
reading has been around in our
culture only for about 700

984
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:46,840
years on any scale, and reading
is an incredible thing

985
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,710
to work correctly.

986
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:50,990
And you saw the whole brain
flicker to get it right.

987
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,560
But now you're going to say
the word in the next

988
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,580
condition, so you're not just
looking at the word, but

989
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,030
you're also saying it.

990
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:58,430
And now finally you're not only
saying a word and looking

991
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:00,270
at it, but you are thinking
about it to come up with

992
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:02,500
smell, or pet.

993
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,150
So they say, what we're going
to do is we're going to do a

994
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:08,160
hierarchy of your mind, just
looking, reading, reading and

995
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,490
talking, reading and talking
and thinking.

996
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:12,500
And by comparing those different
conditions, we'll

997
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,050
subtract them against each
other, and pull out the part

998
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:19,090
of your mind that sees a word,
that speaks a word, and that

999
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:20,790
thinks about a word,
and we'll separate

1000
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:23,700
those out in the brain.

1001
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,340
So basically the subtraction
method.

1002
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,920
So when we compare looking at
fixation versus looking at

1003
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,950
words, we'll see what part of
your brain discovers that it's

1004
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:33,490
a word, knows how to read words,
looking at words versus

1005
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:34,440
repeating them.

1006
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:38,490
We'll discover the basis of
speech, speaking a word versus

1007
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:41,150
coming up with the verb,
thinking about stuff, their

1008
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,970
meaning, and coming
up with an answer.

1009
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:46,640

1010
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,930
So again the idea is if you're
saying something like pet for

1011
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:52,910
the cat, you're doing
all these things.

1012
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:54,770
Or you might just be reading
it aloud, and

1013
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:57,080
we'll subtract them.

1014
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:01,540
In both these conditions, here
you saw a word and read it,

1015
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:06,010
here you saw a word and came
up and produced a verb, you

1016
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:07,980
subtract these two and
you end up with a

1017
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,320
statistical image like this.

1018
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,350
This is not a raw image of
blood, all these you ever see

1019
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:16,200
those are statistics of the
areas that differed by some

1020
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,540
statistical criterion between
one condition and another.

1021
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,890
They're all statistics, they're
not blood, or raw

1022
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:24,780
blood, that underlies it, but
what you see is a statistic,

1023
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,110
and here's the statistic.

1024
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:28,740
Now in both of these cases,
you saw the word.

1025
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:31,520
In this case you simply read it,
in this case you read it

1026
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,110
in your head and you came
up with a verb.

1027
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:36,710
But why don't we see
anything back here?

1028
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:39,550
Why don't we see the seeing of
the word, even though the

1029
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:40,960
seeing occurred in
those conditions?

1030
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,370
Why isn't it visible in
this brain picture?

1031
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:47,750
Because it's been
subtracted out.

1032
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,130
So always in these brain imaging
experiments, for

1033
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:52,570
reasons I'm about to tell you,
we almost always have to do

1034
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:53,600
some kind of subtraction.

1035
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:57,590
And I'll tell you why, but that
subtraction is very big.

1036
00:43:57,590 --> 00:44:00,040
Because what you subtract out,
that's the heart of the

1037
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:03,060
experiment, and your decision
about what's a legitimate

1038
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:03,850
subtraction.

1039
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:06,610
And the reason we have to
do it is this, look

1040
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:07,330
at these two things.

1041
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:09,190
Here's one condition, and here's
the other condition.

1042
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:11,950
Do you see that they look
pretty similar?

1043
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:14,450
Again, signal to noise.

1044
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:18,700
Your brain is busy all the time,
now we ask you to do

1045
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,300
something and see
the difference.

1046
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,820
And the difference is very tiny
by the way we measure it.

1047
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:26,860
It's not tiny mentally, it's
not tiny in terms of the

1048
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:29,700
consequences for civilization
in the world.

1049
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,770
It's tiny because of the weird
way we have to measure it.

1050
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:36,760
I can tell you that if I've
put on an optimal

1051
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,600
checkerboard, the
psychophysicists have said,

1052
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,690
this turns on your
visual cortex.

1053
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:44,010
I'll get about a 3% to 5% change
in your brain signal.

1054
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:48,530
If you wave your arm, I can get
3% to 5% signal change in

1055
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:49,870
your cortex here.

1056
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:52,400
If I ask you to do everything
in between seeing something

1057
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,250
and moving your lips or hand,
everything about thought,

1058
00:44:56,250 --> 00:45:00,690
emotion, memory, desire,
motivation, everything that's

1059
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:03,650
big in our life will get
something like that one tenth

1060
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:05,290
of 1% of the signal change.

1061
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:08,395
One tenth of 1% of the
signal change.

1062
00:45:08,395 --> 00:45:11,420
Yeah, Tyler's like yeah, that
means you have to test a lot

1063
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:14,660
of subjects, and work 40
years on your Ph.D.

1064
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:17,280
So we have to do that
subtraction, because if we

1065
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,880
just take a picture of what's
going on in your head, it's so

1066
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,200
much that we can't tell what's
going on at all.

1067
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,980
And if we have you do something
that's pretty big,

1068
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:26,310
like seeing like a really
provocative picture, we'll

1069
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:29,220
just get one tenth of 1%
of the signal change.

1070
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:31,380
So we have to do the subtraction
to have a hint.

1071
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,540
And then we do one other weird
thing, we don't have to but we

1072
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:34,420
often do it.

1073
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:36,630
We want to average people to
make some general statement

1074
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:40,060
about humanity, as far as we can
do it, based on the 10 MIT

1075
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:42,510
students we test.

1076
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:45,030
So we scrunch everybody's
brain into common space,

1077
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:46,540
everybody's brain's a little
bit different, like their

1078
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:47,750
bodies are a little
bit different.

1079
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:50,320
We scrunch everybody to line
them all up so we have a

1080
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,820
common physical space.

1081
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:54,250
So by the time you see this
picture, it's a statistic on

1082
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:57,000
an average of people in
most cases, but you

1083
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,020
get an amazing story.

1084
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,810
Which up until these
pictures--

1085
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:05,060
about the late 1980s, it was
unimaginable that you could go

1086
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:08,390
inside a living person's brain,
and see what it is that

1087
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:13,020
allows you to hear a word in
auditory cortex, to see a word

1088
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:18,910
in visual cortex, to move your
mouth to speak, or to think,

1089
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:21,820
what's the verb that goes
with that word?

1090
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,800
Unimaginable at your--

1091
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,900
OK, now I have to do the quick
math, but you'll help me out--

1092
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:30,710
what year were you born in?

1093
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:32,410
'82?

1094
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:32,920
'92?

1095
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,320
I know, at my age it
all blends. '92?

1096
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,580
OK, so just a year or two before
you were born-- this

1097
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:41,550
was 5 years before you were--
unimaginable that you could

1098
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:42,750
see such a picture.

1099
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:44,830
When I was a graduate student at
Harvard, and the people at

1100
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:46,370
Washington St. Louis
University--

1101
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:47,600
who did the first of these--

1102
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,930
did an incredible service
to the field.

1103
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:51,880
Here we saw, oh my gosh, it was
like landing on the moon.

1104
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,320
Going inside the human brain,
and knowing which part of the

1105
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:57,500
brain endows us with
human capacities.

1106
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,600
Now, we can be appreciative
or we can be skeptical

1107
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,600
scientists, and we can say this,
let's pick this one.

1108
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,820
Let's compare seeing a
word like "board,"

1109
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:07,970
versus seeing a fixation.

1110
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:11,610
We do that subtraction, and
that's seeing a word.

1111
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:15,200
Just by common sense, what's
wrong with this comparison?

1112
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,460
It's OK it's not terrible.

1113
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,419
How can you control it better?

1114
00:47:20,419 --> 00:47:25,180
To understand what this part of
the brain is really doing?

1115
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:28,426
I heard something?

1116
00:47:28,426 --> 00:47:31,000
Well partly it's a meaningful
word, versus something that

1117
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,390
doesn't mean anything
to a plus.

1118
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:35,460
But what else could you say
is different between them?

1119
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,362
Yeah?

1120
00:47:36,362 --> 00:47:37,346
[INAUDIBLE]

1121
00:47:37,346 --> 00:47:39,810
GUEST SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

1122
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:43,100
PROFESSOR: In this case, oh my
gosh, yes, and I'll come back

1123
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:44,960
to that, but let me not do
that one for the moment,

1124
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,690
because that's a giant story
which I can't fit in today.

1125
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:50,070
Yes your mind can be
all over the place.

1126
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:52,210
So that's definitely the case,
so that's a good one.

1127
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:52,700
Yeah?

1128
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,972
GUEST SPEAKER: You could replace
the plus, which is

1129
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:57,090
like really small,
with [INAUDIBLE]

1130
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:58,882
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's perfect,
OK that's the way I

1131
00:47:58,882 --> 00:48:01,480
was going-- the other one's
great too, two great comments.

1132
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,140
Yeah you could say like, maybe
this is a part of your brain

1133
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:04,850
it goes with five things,
or something this

1134
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:05,920
big versus this big.

1135
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,340
No you go, that's not so
interesting, the part of your

1136
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,360
brain that looks at something
this big, versus this big.

1137
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:13,150
But that's just as legitimate
a conclusion here.

1138
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:16,590
How about this, five different
things, versus only this.

1139
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:18,400
There's a lot of different ways
in which you could say,

1140
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,620
what is the mental operation
that I've discovered in the

1141
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:23,730
human brain and mind, it all
comes down to the comparison.

1142
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:26,880
So here's what they did to
try to do a better job.

1143
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,080
They showed you a more
complicated thing that doesn't

1144
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:32,000
mean anything.

1145
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,490
A bunch of letters that you
can't pronounce, a bunch of

1146
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:38,330
letters that you can pronounce,
but it's not a real

1147
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:41,190
word, and here's the
real world itself.

1148
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:43,130
So if you want to say, what do
you think this part of the

1149
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:45,760
mind is doing?

1150
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,160
What part the mind does this
part of the brain allow to

1151
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,870
happen in humans, and only
humans on this planet?

1152
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:54,150
And every word you ever read
only happens because this part

1153
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:55,880
of the brain does
what it does.

1154
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,360
What is that part of
the brain doing?

1155
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,090
Is it just simply responding
too complicated

1156
00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:01,372
things, five of them?

1157
00:49:01,372 --> 00:49:04,260
No, not much, a little
bit, but not much.

1158
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,470
How about letters, letters are
pretty interesting, but there

1159
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:09,760
can't be a word by English,
you can't pronounce this.

1160
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,270
Not too interested?

1161
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:14,930
A word, a set of letters you've
never seen together

1162
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:17,290
before, but you can pronounce
by the rules of English.

1163
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:18,710
Boom.

1164
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:20,870
That's what I do, says this
part of the brain,

1165
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:22,360
that's what I do.

1166
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:25,080
I say, I see something, and it's
possibly a word and I can

1167
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,780
say it by the rules
of English.

1168
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:27,900
And by the way, if it's
a word I've done

1169
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,430
before, I do that too.

1170
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:31,600
I'm pretty flexible, I can do
new words, I can do words I've

1171
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,030
known before.

1172
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:39,180
It matches what you see with
language, that's reading.

1173
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:41,870
Only our species can take our
visual system, and the

1174
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:44,730
language you learn as a child,
and put them together, and

1175
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:47,180
allow our civilization
to read.

1176
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:52,400
And this is a part of the brain
where those roads meet.

1177
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,570
And by the way, we talked about
local and global, the

1178
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:56,470
forest and the trees.

1179
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:58,416
And consistent with what we
talked about the split brain

1180
00:49:58,416 --> 00:50:00,932
patients, looking at global
stuff right hemisphere, if

1181
00:50:00,932 --> 00:50:02,640
you're looking at local stuff,
left hemisphere.

1182
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,270
So we like it when the
information we have from

1183
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:07,170
split-brain patients, or stroke
patients aligns with

1184
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:10,210
healthy people doing a task
as they typically do.

1185
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:11,600
Because then we sort of believe
there's something

1186
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,590
right about that.

1187
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:18,610
So PET, pretty good spatial
resolution, I mean, depends

1188
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:19,750
what you mean by good.

1189
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,860
My neuroscience colleagues
dismiss everything we ever do

1190
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:25,310
as sort of pathetically
imprecise.

1191
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:27,380
But 5 to 10 millimeters,
not as good as fMRI.

1192
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:29,950

1193
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:32,160
The temporal resolution is very
poor we can only take one

1194
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,560
picture that lasts about
a minute, and averages

1195
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,770
everything across that.

1196
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:40,280
You have to inject people with
radioactive stuff, and it's

1197
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,120
correlational.

1198
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,880
But it has one other thing
that's really, really

1199
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,020
interesting, Positron
Emission Tomography.

1200
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:49,240
Because you're injecting a
radioactive label, you can

1201
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,510
create different kinds of labels
that go to different

1202
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:52,620
parts of the brain.

1203
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:55,830
So here's Parkinson's disease,
which involves damage the

1204
00:50:55,830 --> 00:50:57,840
Substantia nigra, and
the Basal Ganglia.

1205
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,770
Here's a healthy persons
Substantia nigra, and here's a

1206
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:02,640
person with Parkinson's disease,
where these cells

1207
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,210
have died away.

1208
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:06,760
Typically, at least 80% of these
have to die before a

1209
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:11,410
person shows Parkinson's disease
symptoms clinically.

1210
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:14,200
Here's an injection of
radioactive stuff using PET

1211
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:17,840
that binds to Dopamine
receiving neurons.

1212
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,210
And you can see that in the
living Parkinson's patient,

1213
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:22,710
this tremendous reduction
in these

1214
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:24,960
receptors waiting for Dopamine.

1215
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,040
In a living patient

1216
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:28,410
specifically Dopamine receptors.

1217
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:30,860
So that's a disease.

1218
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:33,550
Here's why video games are
taking over the world.

1219
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:34,160
Oh no, not yet.

1220
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,530
We can do one more thing.

1221
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:38,550
We can track the disease from a
typical person, to a person

1222
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:41,680
with moderate Parkinson's
disease or severe.

1223
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,850
Within the disease, we
can see differences.

1224
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:46,860
But here's why video games are
taking over the world, because

1225
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:49,670
if we take a healthy person,
young adults, give them this

1226
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:53,640
kind of Dopamine binding tracer,
and have them play a

1227
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,680
video game, two things happen.

1228
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:59,150
A, the parts of your brain that
are involved in reward,

1229
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:01,020
Dopamine, is the strongest
to reward

1230
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,100
neurotransmitter that we know.

1231
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:07,430
Things go crazy, and what this
graph is showing you is the

1232
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:10,260
better you do, the more
rewarded you are.

1233
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,900
This is why you will go for the
next level, because to get

1234
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,720
that dopamine fix, you
got to keep going.

1235
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,130

1236
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:20,210
And we think these reward
mechanisms underlie

1237
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:23,330
everything, in many ways they
relate to everything.

1238
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:26,890
Why do you do whatever you do,
because at some level, in some

1239
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:28,910
way, you find it rewarding.

1240
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:33,070
And the data is very compelling
that way.

1241
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:36,570
The last method I'll talk about
is functional MRI, and

1242
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,310
it's the one that's most
widely visible.

1243
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:42,256
So you sit in a scanner, stimula
are presented to you

1244
00:52:42,256 --> 00:52:43,360
to perform a task.

1245
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,700
We do a lot of stuff in our
lab with children, we show

1246
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:48,640
them how the frog would do it.

1247
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,680
For those of you who've done a
functional MRI experiment,

1248
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,280
because there were so many
hands that were put up.

1249
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:55,570
Do any of you want to say a
word about your experience

1250
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:56,850
doing that?

1251
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:59,280
What was it like, easy,
huge fun, recommend,

1252
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,200
no, not so much fun.

1253
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,720
It will vary a little bit.

1254
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:04,970
We said noisy.

1255
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:09,630

1256
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:12,174
Some people find it
claustrophobic.

1257
00:53:12,174 --> 00:53:13,108
GUEST SPEAKER: I dont know, I
didn't really do anything.

1258
00:53:13,108 --> 00:53:16,380
I just had to sit there for a
really long time and not move.

1259
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:18,030
PROFESSOR: Oh, so they didn't
ask you to do a task, maybe.

1260
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:20,716
GUEST SPEAKER: Well, for
a big part of it, I

1261
00:53:20,716 --> 00:53:21,890
was watching a movie.

1262
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:25,840
PROFESSOR: So for the student
they were watching a movie not

1263
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,242
doing anything,

1264
00:53:27,242 --> 00:53:29,990
GUEST SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

1265
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:31,640
PROFESSOR: You were doing
yes or no clicks.

1266
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,380
So that would be typical
functional MRI kind of

1267
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:36,110
experiment, some of them are
more obnoxious, some are less,

1268
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:40,000
some are funny, some
are not as funny.

1269
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,340
Any other experiences?

1270
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:46,830
Was it comfortable, not so
comfortable, medium.

1271
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:49,755
Anybody else want to share?

1272
00:53:49,755 --> 00:53:50,530
No, OK.

1273
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:51,780
OK.

1274
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:54,320

1275
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,940
So how does this work?

1276
00:53:56,940 --> 00:54:00,370
Functional MRI takes advantage
of MRI but it focuses on

1277
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:03,260
hemoglobin, the stuff that
carries oxygen in your blood.

1278
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:06,920
And it rests on the fact that
after oxygen has been

1279
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:10,060
extracted it's more sensitive
to the magnetic field than

1280
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:11,470
oxygenated hemoglobin.

1281
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:12,960
So it's like this.

1282
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:19,160
Here's basically capillaries and
veins, arteries and veins.

1283
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:22,050
And as you go through the
capillary bed, the smallest

1284
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:25,400
vessels, neurons are extracting
oxygen to support

1285
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,700
their physical life.

1286
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:31,260
What happens when this part of
the brain gets active, is that

1287
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:35,070
more oxygen is extracted to
support the active neurons.

1288
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:40,140
So we call this BOLD effect,
blood oxygen level dependent.

1289
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:43,560
So we're measuring the change in
blood, changes the ratio of

1290
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:46,420
oxygenated to deoxygenated
hemoglobins, that changes the

1291
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:48,430
magnetic field as
we measure it.

1292
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:51,100
And that's what we directly
measure, not the neurons.

1293
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:53,770
So if the neurons are using up
oxygen, why does the BOLD

1294
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:57,570
signal increase, why does
this ratio go up?

1295
00:54:57,570 --> 00:55:00,480
Because intuitively you'd
think it would go down,

1296
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,940
because oxygen is being
extracted at a higher rate.

1297
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:06,260

1298
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:09,140
If you look at oxygen being
extracted, right after

1299
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:13,440
something happens, 10
seconds, there's an

1300
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,730
initial dip of oxygen.

1301
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:17,830
That's the neurons extracting
oxygen to replenish themselves

1302
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:20,750
from their activity, their
activity has been to give your

1303
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:23,490
mind its life.

1304
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:27,950
Then what happens is there's
this vast oversupply for much

1305
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:30,180
longer time.

1306
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:33,420
Intuitively, it's as if we
said it's so important to

1307
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:35,730
metabolically support the
neurons that make up our

1308
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:39,580
minds, that if some areas
demanding a lot of blood, we

1309
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:43,990
send over way too much extra
as soon as we can, from a

1310
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:47,480
distance to make sure
everything's OK.

1311
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:51,720
And because our measurement is
so sad, we almost can never

1312
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:54,720
measure this initial dip.

1313
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,470
We almost always measure the
sustained oversupply of oxygen

1314
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:00,470
to that part of the brain.

1315
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:04,040
So you could say it's such
a house of cards.

1316
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:07,690
The oversupply of the blood
going to a part of the brain

1317
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:10,840
changes the balance of
oxygenated to deoxygenated

1318
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:13,950
hemoglobin that changes
the magnetic property.

1319
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:16,440
And that's how we try to figure
out what that part of

1320
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,950
the brain is doing
for your mind.

1321
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:22,000
But it works pretty well
in some cases.

1322
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,820
Decent Spatial Resolution, no
injection, you can zoom in a

1323
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:28,710
scanner and do a lot of
different things.

1324
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:31,500
Modest Temporal Resolution,
because it's not milliseconds,

1325
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:34,960
it's always on the order of
seconds, that's correlational,

1326
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,560
not causal.

1327
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,150
But you get some amazing
results, I'm just going to

1328
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:40,300
present to you two or three.

1329
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,800
So here's one, a thing we're
very interested about humans

1330
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,420
is empathy.

1331
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:48,500
How much we understand and feel
other people's happiness,

1332
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,200
or sadness, or pain.

1333
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,430
So the "observation or
imagination of another person

1334
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:55,420
in a particular emotional state
automatically activates

1335
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:58,660
a representation of that state
in the observer," empathy.

1336
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:02,780
And how do we understand how
another person feels, and we

1337
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:04,570
think that's a big thing
in how we relate to

1338
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:06,680
one another as humans.

1339
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:11,250
So Tania Singer did the
following experiment, we

1340
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:12,280
talked about this
before a little

1341
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,960
bit, embodied cognition.

1342
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:17,420
That we understand others out
there by the feelings

1343
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:18,590
we know within us.

1344
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:20,620
We don't know their feelings,
but we know our

1345
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:22,470
feelings inside us.

1346
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:25,390
So here's what she did, she
brought in pairs of people who

1347
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:28,920
were friends, or romantic
partners.

1348
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:33,650
And she either had them get
some pain, it was a shock,

1349
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:38,090
within ethical boundaries, but
not pleasant, that's the pain.

1350
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:41,780
Or, you got to watch through a
video camera, while you're

1351
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:44,730
being imaged, your partner
getting the shock.

1352
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:47,370
So think about somebody you
care about and think about

1353
00:57:47,370 --> 00:57:49,960
them getting something painful,
and how you would

1354
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,490
feel at that moment.

1355
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:54,330
And they asked in the brain,
what's similar and dissimilar,

1356
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:56,940
and we'll focus on what's
similar right now, between

1357
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:01,250
feeling pain yourself, and
observing pain in somebody you

1358
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:05,140
care about, emphasizing with the
pain you see them having.

1359
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:07,900
And what they found is two
areas, something of an

1360
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:10,270
Anterior Cingulate, and
something in the Insula, which

1361
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:13,500
we talked about before, where
there was a lot of overlap.

1362
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:17,110
So this phrase, I'm feeling your
pain, in your brain when

1363
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:20,800
you feel for somebody else's
pain in this physical sense,

1364
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,910
you turn on some of the same
brain areas as when you feel

1365
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:25,660
physical pain directly.

1366
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,690
It's as if the basis to imagine
another person's

1367
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:31,290
feelings is the feelings you
know so well yourself.

1368
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:33,600
And this is literally shown
now by the brain imaging.

1369
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:36,430
It could've been a story, a
metaphor, an argument, this is

1370
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:40,350
scientific evidence that
supports that likelihood.

1371
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:43,970
So we're going to expend it
in a slightly fun way.

1372
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:46,970
There's been a lot of study in
neuroeconomics thinking about

1373
00:58:46,970 --> 00:58:50,120
how we think about, for example,
things like trust.

1374
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:52,210
So one game, and there's a
number of them, is called the

1375
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:53,000
ultimatum game.

1376
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,260
And many people probably
know this, but let me

1377
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:55,520
remind you of this.

1378
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,900
This version of it has
two players, a

1379
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:00,520
proposer, and a responder.

1380
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:03,210
And what they do is they give
to proposer a certain amount

1381
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:11,450
of money, and the proposer is
allowed to make an offer to

1382
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:13,500
the responder.

1383
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:17,990
If the responder says, No,
nobody gets any money.

1384
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:20,620
Usually people offered about
50%, so let's make this

1385
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:22,050
concrete just for a moment.

1386
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:24,620
Can I pick you for a second?

1387
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:25,870
You can decline.

1388
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:28,320

1389
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:34,080
Imagine if Tyler came over to
me and give me $10, and I

1390
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:37,710
said, how would you feel if I
gave you five and I kept five.

1391
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:39,400
What do you think?

1392
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,240
Might you go for It?

1393
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,010
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah, sure.

1394
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:43,620
PROFESSOR: I mean, you go, I'm
$5 dollars ahead, you're $5

1395
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:47,440
ahead, Tyler won't eat this
month because graduate student

1396
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,480
stipends are modest, but it's
a zero sum game in the end.

1397
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,440

1398
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:57,270
So now Tyler comes over hands
me 10 more dollars, and I

1399
00:59:57,270 --> 00:59:59,300
offer you one.

1400
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:01,950
What's your first feeling
assuming that I wasn't your

1401
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:03,200
teacher grading you?

1402
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,230

1403
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:08,660
He saw me get ten,
I say here's one.

1404
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:09,972
What's your feeling?

1405
01:00:09,972 --> 01:00:11,780
Think about it just for--

1406
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:13,136
GUEST SPEAKER: You'd feel
kind of cheated.

1407
01:00:13,136 --> 01:00:14,040
PROFESSOR: --yeah.

1408
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:18,490
You don't have to, by purely
economic perspective, would

1409
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:20,690
you be ahead by taking
that dollar?

1410
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:21,530
Yeah.

1411
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:24,140
A dollar's a dollar, $2
is $2, but people

1412
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:26,430
have a sense of fairness.

1413
01:00:26,430 --> 01:00:32,410
Even to their own detriment,
if you offer $2 and lower.

1414
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:35,990
Even knowing that you're just
ruining $1 or two you would've

1415
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:38,630
gotten for nothing, except
saying yes, people half the

1416
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:40,500
time will say no.

1417
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,540
It's like, you are so unfair--

1418
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:45,210
you were saying to me, I would
never say this to you-- you

1419
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:47,960
are so unfair, that we're going
to take us both down,

1420
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,750
rather than you have the
pleasure of the $8.

1421
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:51,620
OK It's so unfair,
that my sense

1422
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:54,860
of fairness is disturbed.

1423
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:57,010
It's an interesting way to
think about it, imagine a

1424
01:00:57,010 --> 01:01:00,215
friend of yours is handed $10,
and they offer you half, and

1425
01:01:00,215 --> 01:01:02,810
if you say no, nobody
gets anything, so

1426
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:05,210
it's a trust game.

1427
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:07,310
They had the people in the
scanner playing this game with

1428
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:09,490
two people they saw on
a video monitor.

1429
01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:11,930
The two people they're playing
with are set up.

1430
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:13,690
The person in the scanner is
the real participant, the

1431
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:16,490
people out there they see,
are confederates,

1432
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:17,700
they're play actors.

1433
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:20,890
And one is a fair person, here's
$5, thank you, here's

1434
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:22,430
$5, thank you.

1435
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:26,160
Here's $6, oh, you're awesome,
we can get along, And then

1436
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,450
there's an unfair player,
here's $1.

1437
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:31,300
And you go, why is
this guy a jerk?

1438
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:33,210
How about $2?

1439
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:36,670
And after a while, you go the
fair player was very decent,

1440
01:01:36,670 --> 01:01:38,070
this unfair player--

1441
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:40,450
who you believe is part of the
experiment, but is a set up--

1442
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:42,310
and you're just thinking, why
is this person such a jerk?

1443
01:01:42,310 --> 01:01:45,300
They're constantly getting $10,
and constantly giving me

1444
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:46,380
one or two.

1445
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:47,630
No, no, no thank you.

1446
01:01:47,630 --> 01:01:51,840

1447
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:55,870
Now, you get a shock, and you
see these two strangers, one

1448
01:01:55,870 --> 01:01:58,210
of whom was a wonderful, fair
player, and one of whom was an

1449
01:01:58,210 --> 01:01:59,780
absurdly unfair player.

1450
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:02,350
You see them get a shock.

1451
01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:04,300
And they had both men and women
in the scanner watching

1452
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:05,220
these things happen.

1453
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:07,450
And here's what happened,
and it's kind of

1454
01:02:07,450 --> 01:02:09,280
funny, but you know.

1455
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:12,830
For the women they had overlap
again between the parts of the

1456
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:15,710
brain to turn on in here in the
insula, when they got a

1457
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:19,240
shock, and when either the fair
player got a shock, or

1458
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:20,350
the unfair player.

1459
01:02:20,350 --> 01:02:23,150
They felt bad for both
by this measure.

1460
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:25,840
Look at the men in the study.

1461
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:29,730
I feel bad if the fair guy gets
it, but this part of the

1462
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:31,950
brain's like, yeah, give
it to 'em, can

1463
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:35,370
you push up the voltage?

1464
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:37,590
It just came out this way,
whether it would work that way

1465
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:40,930
under all circumstances, all
ages, all societies, other

1466
01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:42,250
groups of men and women,
don't know.

1467
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:45,610
But in this sample in
the United Kingdom,

1468
01:02:45,610 --> 01:02:49,050
the men had no empathy.

1469
01:02:49,050 --> 01:02:51,480
It's worse than that, it's
worse than they had no

1470
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:54,520
empathy, let me show you this.

1471
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,940
If they asked to indicate their

1472
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:59,020
desire for revenge against--

1473
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:00,390
this is a behavioral response--
their desire for

1474
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:03,370
revenge against the
bad player.

1475
01:03:03,370 --> 01:03:06,390
I don't think they pursued the
unfair player down the street,

1476
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:07,760
but just that feeling.

1477
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:11,550
And the women said, a little
bit, the men said yes, if only

1478
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:13,550
I could take down this person,
that would be great.

1479
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:15,160
And here's the amazing thing,
we'll come back to the

1480
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,520
structure called a nucleus
accumbens.

1481
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:19,450
It sits in the bottom of
the Basal Ganglia.

1482
01:03:19,450 --> 01:03:22,590
It's the structure that in the
human brain is most identified

1483
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:25,675
with reward and pleasure, most
identified with reward and

1484
01:03:25,675 --> 01:03:27,540
pleasure by fMRI imaging.

1485
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:29,280
Look at the nucleus
accumbens when the

1486
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:33,930
unfair player gets zapped.

1487
01:03:33,930 --> 01:03:37,770
The women, nothing much, the
men boom, big reward.

1488
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:40,380
Revenge is rewarding
in their brain.

1489
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:44,260
No sympathy, and lots of revenge
satisfaction for the

1490
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:45,260
unfair player.

1491
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:47,870
Now you can decide on your own
life who this applies to or

1492
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:50,880
not, but it's sort
of fun to explore

1493
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:51,680
these different things.

1494
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:55,140
How we form ideas about empathy,
trust, whether they

1495
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:57,490
are in a society
we grow up in.

1496
01:03:57,490 --> 01:04:00,120
Somewhat different on average
men and women, huge ranges

1497
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:01,840
within men huge ranges
within women.

1498
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,530
So it's a sort of fun
thing to explore.

1499
01:04:03,530 --> 01:04:07,540
Let me end with something that's
much more difficult and

1500
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:10,050
disturbing, but another place
where imaging is giving us

1501
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:14,260
insights that you could not
imagined having some time ago.

1502
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:16,760
So this is a very difficult
case, I don't know if any of

1503
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:19,370
you gone through it, I don't
wish it for you.

1504
01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:21,220
Some of you probably have, and
many of you will at sometime

1505
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:23,930
in your life, when you have to
make an end of life decision.

1506
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:30,380
And amongst the most famous of
these cases was Terry Schiavo.

1507
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:32,990
Now I don't know that name even
rings a bell for you, but

1508
01:04:32,990 --> 01:04:36,670
it got very, very famous amongst
these kinds of cases.

1509
01:04:36,670 --> 01:04:39,260
So she had a cardiac arrest,
she had took a lot of diet

1510
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:40,700
pills, and that may
have contributed.

1511
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:43,820
In February 25, 1990, she went
into a coma, and then a

1512
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:44,750
vegetative state.

1513
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:47,860
So a vegetative state is when
a person seems to be kind of

1514
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:50,430
awake, but when you talk with
them, they're not very aware,

1515
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:51,990
they're not responsive, they're
not noticing, they're

1516
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:52,270
not talking.

1517
01:04:52,270 --> 01:04:54,230
But their eyes are open, and
they're awake, their eyes are

1518
01:04:54,230 --> 01:04:57,040
not closed, so that's
what she is.

1519
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:59,650
And they put in her a feeding
tube, because without that she

1520
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:04,580
wouldn't live, she couldn't
eat and feed herself.

1521
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:07,270
It was a heartbreaking
difference of opinion between

1522
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:09,510
her husband and her parents.

1523
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:13,460
Her husband petitioned some
years later, actually eight

1524
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:15,680
years later, to remove
the feeding tube and

1525
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,330
let her pass away.

1526
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:19,750
The parents opposed that, they
said that's not her wishes,

1527
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,730
she would want to keep on going
with the feeding tube.

1528
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:23,620
The husband said no, I don't
believe that's her wishes.

1529
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:26,950
So you have this very tragic
confrontation between the

1530
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:29,350
parents who loved her, and the
husband who presumably loved

1531
01:05:29,350 --> 01:05:33,270
her having different ideas about
what to do with her,

1532
01:05:33,270 --> 01:05:35,440
whether to end her
life or not.

1533
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:38,470
So finally her tube was removed,
but then the parents

1534
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:40,770
went to court, and a judge
reversed it, and they

1535
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:41,820
put the tube back.

1536
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:45,850
She became, sadly, kind of
back and forth, living

1537
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:48,220
nonliving, on judicial
decisions.

1538
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:51,630
Her case became particularly
famous, for a bunch of

1539
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:55,290
reasons, and it went back and
forth from court, to court.

1540
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:58,440
Moving up in the state courts,
and there were several US

1541
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:02,590
Supreme Court decisions about
whether to remove the tube, or

1542
01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:03,980
keep the tube in.

1543
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:06,520
And it's a tragic thing, it's
a tragic choice between the

1544
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:07,860
parents and the husband.

1545
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:10,170
It got to the US Congress,
in the US Senate.

1546
01:06:10,170 --> 01:06:14,840
President Bush signed a bill
to keep her alive.

1547
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:18,380
Everybody got involved, with
various opinions, finally the

1548
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:21,520
Supreme Court made a series
of decisions.

1549
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,680
It was disconnected in
2005, and she died in

1550
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,200
March 31 of that year.

1551
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:28,450
So tragic difficult decision,
and a tragic family situation

1552
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:30,180
that became kind
of a political,

1553
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:32,260
and judicial football.

1554
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:34,610
So what's going on in the mind
of somebody like this, and how

1555
01:06:34,610 --> 01:06:37,215
could we even begin to interpret
it for a person who

1556
01:06:37,215 --> 01:06:40,620
can't speak for themselves
and can't respond.

1557
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:41,760
So let me tell you about
a different case, we

1558
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,790
don't know her case.

1559
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:48,640
So, again a vegetative state is
one where you appear to be

1560
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,100
awake, but there's no
sign of awareness.

1561
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:51,790
Eyes are open, but the person's
not talking or

1562
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:53,300
responding to anything
in their environment.

1563
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:56,700
So here's a different woman, 23
years old, in 2005 she had

1564
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:59,460
a road traffic accident, severe
traumatic brain injury.

1565
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:02,120
Five months later she's
un-responsive, but she has

1566
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:03,970
preserved sleep-wake, like
she's waking up going to

1567
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:04,930
sleep, waking up
going to sleep.

1568
01:07:04,930 --> 01:07:09,650
Eyes open, but un-responsive
in every other way.

1569
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:12,810
They put her into an fMRI
scanner, as well as healthy

1570
01:07:12,810 --> 01:07:15,550
comparison people, and
they have them do to

1571
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:19,060
mental imagery tasks.

1572
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:21,130
they read instructions to her.

1573
01:07:21,130 --> 01:07:24,940
But you go into scanner, and
you're told to imagine two

1574
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:26,300
different things.

1575
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:30,120
Playing tennis, so imagine in
your mind's eye you playing

1576
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:32,040
tennis for a moment,
imagine that.

1577
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:34,880
Or imagine visiting all the
rooms of your house starting

1578
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,790
with your front door, in the
house that you are living in

1579
01:07:37,790 --> 01:07:38,930
now, or where you grew up.

1580
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:40,870
Imagine those two things
in your mind.

1581
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:42,820
First of all, just a pure
cognitive neuroscience level,

1582
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:45,250
and we'll come back to that,
imagination is a really

1583
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:46,480
interesting thing.

1584
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:50,290
And it turns out when we imagine
things, again we use

1585
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:52,340
the parts of our brain that
does them, imagination is

1586
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:53,820
perception run backwards.

1587
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:56,700
We can see imagination
in the human brain.

1588
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:58,680
And depending on what you're
imagining, you use the same

1589
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:00,570
systems that you see with.

1590
01:08:00,570 --> 01:08:02,610
If you imagine something you're
looking at, it will

1591
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:04,120
turn on your visual system,
it's even more

1592
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:05,590
specific than that.

1593
01:08:05,590 --> 01:08:08,500
So let's first look at what
happens with the controls.

1594
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,810
When they imagine they're
playing tennis, they turn on

1595
01:08:10,810 --> 01:08:14,010
the supplementary motor area,
that's a part of your brain

1596
01:08:14,010 --> 01:08:16,960
that plans your physical
movements.

1597
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:19,830
You're not moving, but you're
thinking about it, this is

1598
01:08:19,830 --> 01:08:21,640
imagination of movement.

1599
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:24,120
When you plan a movement.,
you turn that on.

1600
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:26,819
When you go around your house,
you turn on spatial areas that

1601
01:08:26,819 --> 01:08:30,529
are in the parahippocampal
cortex, and similar areas,

1602
01:08:30,529 --> 01:08:32,710
parietal cortex, and
parahippocampal cortex.

1603
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:35,080
They're turned on if we show
you a movie where you're

1604
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,189
moving around in spaces.

1605
01:08:36,189 --> 01:08:39,479
If you see spaces, you turn
those on, if you imagine

1606
01:08:39,479 --> 01:08:40,439
spaces, you turn them on.

1607
01:08:40,439 --> 01:08:44,229
So imagination in the brain is
perception run backwards, or

1608
01:08:44,229 --> 01:08:47,640
physical action run backwards,
you're not actually doing it.

1609
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:50,050
But look at this patient who
got in the scanner, who was

1610
01:08:50,050 --> 01:08:53,910
non responsive, you read her the
instructions, and see what

1611
01:08:53,910 --> 01:08:56,500
she does, and look
at her brain.

1612
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:59,859
Asked to imagine tennis,
asked to imagine the

1613
01:08:59,859 --> 01:09:01,270
rooms in her house.

1614
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:02,920
It looks just like that.

1615
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:04,569
What does that mean, just
in a common sense,

1616
01:09:04,569 --> 01:09:07,260
what does that mean?

1617
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:10,319
Did she understand the
instruction, at some level

1618
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:14,279
yes, she wouldn't turn on those
parts of the brain if

1619
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:18,335
she didn't understand the
instruction, she imagines the

1620
01:09:18,335 --> 01:09:20,950
thing you ask her to instruct.

1621
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:22,340
So this guy on the front page
of the New York Times said

1622
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:25,310
fMRI could tell you the internal
mental life of a

1623
01:09:25,310 --> 01:09:27,609
person could no longer
speak, or communicate

1624
01:09:27,609 --> 01:09:29,470
with any other way.

1625
01:09:29,470 --> 01:09:33,270
Now it's turned out since then,
that when they put in

1626
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:35,490
other patients into the scanner,
most of them don't

1627
01:09:35,490 --> 01:09:37,170
show this pattern.

1628
01:09:37,170 --> 01:09:40,830
So it's not that every patient
in a vegetative state this is

1629
01:09:40,830 --> 01:09:43,149
full of mental life
like this person.

1630
01:09:43,149 --> 01:09:45,359
And a deeper way, we don't
really understand what this

1631
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:46,740
mental life is like.

1632
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:49,422
We don't know whether she
simply understands some

1633
01:09:49,422 --> 01:09:51,899
things, but doesn't have
feelings, or plans, or

1634
01:09:51,899 --> 01:09:53,830
desires, or whether
she has those too.

1635
01:09:53,830 --> 01:09:56,860
We don't understand really the
full range of mental life, but

1636
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:59,950
we know that she can understand
an instruction, and

1637
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:01,760
her brain follows
through with it.

1638
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,480
Most patients, it turns out,
don't look like that in

1639
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:05,850
vegetative states.

1640
01:10:05,850 --> 01:10:08,840
So again, brain imaging has
taken us inside the mind of

1641
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:11,120
somebody who cannot communicate
for themselves and

1642
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:13,060
let us say something about
what it is that's

1643
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:15,340
going on in that mind.

1644
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:17,800
In conclusion, we've talked
about different ways of

1645
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:20,680
learning about the brain,
different methods to record

1646
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,920
structure and function that
vary in their temporal and

1647
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:24,280
spatial acuity.

1648
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:28,480
And incredibly different ways in
which we can understand the

1649
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:31,190
organization in time and space
of how the brain supports the

1650
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:32,440
human mind.

1651
01:10:32,440 --> 01:11:00,628
