10
00:00:27,572 --> 00:00:29,470
PROFESSOR: OK, good afternoon.

11
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,030
So in the last couple of weeks,
we've gone through some

12
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,060
of the major human capacities
that you have and I have and

13
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,840
most people have most
of them, right?

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,530
Which are the ability to see the
world around us, to attend

15
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:49,240
to what's important, to learn
lessons from life, to remember

16
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,580
things, why we sometimes
forget things.

17
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,880
And today, we're going to talk
about another huge dimension

18
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,200
of human experience, of the
human mind, of the human

19
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,940
brain, language.

20
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,900
The ability to talk
to one another.

21
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,900
I can talk, you can listen,
and vice versa.

22
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,060
To read, to communicate,
in the ways that are so

23
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,580
remarkable.

24
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,270
Our life is flooded with
language, right?

25
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,910
That we hear, that we
read, and so on.

26
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:18,040
So when psychologists try to
divide up language and the

27
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,610
study of both components, they
talk about comprehension,

28
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,800
understanding what somebody
says to you when you're an

29
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,900
infant, or now, as an adult, or
reading text, or producing

30
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,720
speech, which you can do with
your mouth by speaking, or you

31
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,440
learn to write.

32
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,230
So you can both comprehend and
produce language, both

33
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,340
visually and orally.

34
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:41,720
And the thing that has greatly
enamored linguists to figure

35
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,400
out is how language that we
speak is endlessly generative.

36
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,980
I'm not sure you can actually
calculate out how many

37
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,600
sentences we could possibly
produce, but just for fun,

38
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,590
people have done stuff.

39
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,870
And they said it would take 100
trillion years to memorize

40
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,460
all the sentences
we can produce.

41
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,890
I'm not sure that's
exactly the right

42
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,540
number, but it's a lot.

43
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,670
Because we can say a lot of
different sentences and

44
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,030
understand what a person
is saying.

45
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:05,970
It's an incredibly generative
system for communication, one

46
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,090
person to another.

47
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:12,120
So when people in psychology
think about different aspects

48
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,590
of language, levels of language,
they often divide it

49
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,190
into something like this.

50
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,140
Phonology is the sounds of
language that we hear, that we

51
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,700
acquire as infants, that we use
to speak to one another.

52
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,490
Syntax, grammar.

53
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,240
And by this, this isn't school
grammar, not get

54
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,910
the sentence right.

55
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,930
It's just the understanding of
the organization of words, and

56
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,610
how that changes the meaning
of the sentence.

57
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:34,930
Syntax.

58
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,730
Semantics, what do
the words mean?

59
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,060
What do the groups
of words mean?

60
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,830
Pragmatics.

61
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,150
And we'll talk about each
of these a little bit.

62
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,420
Sometimes a person
is sarcastic.

63
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,730
So they go, that was an awesome
lecture yesterday in

64
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:50,240
psychology.

65
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,190
Somebody could say that, in
a hundred trillion years.

66
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,540
And you go, yeah, yeah.

67
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,550
Right?

68
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,490
So that's the pragmatics
versus semantics.

69
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,700
Then, of course, it's
not just sentences.

70
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,240
We have whole discussions.

71
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,450
And another aspect of language
we'll just touch on a little

72
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,760
bit today is emotional
comprehension and production.

73
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,980
The tone somebody speaks in, the
tone you produce, are also

74
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,270
informative.

75
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,740
So there's many aspects
of language.

76
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,890
We'll start with the most
basic, or phonology.

77
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,320
So phonemes are the words that
people use to describe the

78
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,350
building blocks of
speech sounds.

79
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,010
So boy versus toy are different
by one phoneme.

80
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,340
Phonemes are the building
blocks of

81
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,030
the sounds of language.

82
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:31,580
Humans use about 100 phonemes
across languages, but any

83
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,540
given language only
uses a subset.

84
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,530
And this has really interesting
consequences.

85
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,020
Of course, a language could only
exist in the world if you

86
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,970
could understand
those phonemes.

87
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,435
Phonemes that are
ununderstandable aren't going

88
00:03:43,435 --> 00:03:45,030
to be a part of anybody's
language.

89
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,820
But different languages, for
historical reasons, have ended

90
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,520
up using different subsets
of phonemes.

91
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,620
And we'll come back to that.

92
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,480
When we're babies, for about
the first six months of our

93
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,830
lives, we're universal
learners.

94
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,440
We know all the phonemes and
respond to all of them.

95
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,970
As we become native language
speakers and listeners, we

96
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,120
become only good at the ones
that are used in our language,

97
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,530
and our ability to even
recognize the ones that are

98
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,920
not in our language
disappears.

99
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,370
You can get it back some, but
the older that you are, you

100
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,500
never get it back fully.

101
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,060
So we're universal learners at
birth, but we become enslaved

102
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,019
to the language that we are
native speakers of and listen

103
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,720
to within months of birth.

104
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,430

105
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,430
English has about 45.

106
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,430
So it's more than the number
of letters we have.

107
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,760
Some people get confused
a little bit

108
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,920
that letters are phonemes.

109
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,830
They're not.

110
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:39,630
So hot and cold, the oh sound
in hot and the oh sound in

111
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,540
cold are different sounds,
same letters.

112
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,390
So there's many more phonemes.

113
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,700
Even in English, when they say
there's about 45, depending on

114
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,520
dialects, you could have a
couple more, a couple less.

115
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,010
So again, we're born
to use all of them.

116
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,290
Then we use them or lose them.

117
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,430
It's something, we don't
entirely lose it, but we're

118
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,150
never as good if we try to learn
a distinction once we

119
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,980
become older than that.

120
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,660
Humans understand speech
at an incredible rate.

121
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,470
The typical fast talking is
about 180 words a minute, 14

122
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,580
phonemes a second in a
continuous speech stream.

123
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,560
But people can go
up to 250 words.

124
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,530
We're incredibly fast language
processors, incredibly fast

125
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,100
language processors.

126
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,150
So how do we roughly
conceptualize, in the most

127
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:25,780
simple way, what we have to do
to get to a word that we hear,

128
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,950
to get to its meaning.

129
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,910
Well, acoustic information
comes through the ear.

130
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:33,850
Those are wave forms, physical
things, arriving at our ears.

131
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,650
We in some way figure out how
those correspond to phonemes,

132
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,260
and then map that in some
way to words that have

133
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,510
meanings in the world.

134
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,450

135
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:49,300
And the reason why machines
understanding what you say is

136
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,200
shockingly hard to do
a good job on is for

137
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,390
the following reason.

138
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,400
There's a huge difference
between a word by the time

139
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,360
your mind understands what it
is and the nature of the

140
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,210
signal that arrived
at your year.

141
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,770
So we talked a lot about
that in terms of

142
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,440
the retina in vision.

143
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:05,940
Right?

144
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,170
You have this very impoverished
stuff that

145
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,670
arrives in your retina, and then
the whole rest of your

146
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,990
brain, millions and millions
of neurons and synapses,

147
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,780
reconstruct what's out there
from a very impoverished

148
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,110
retinal input.

149
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,860
And the same thing happens
in audition.

150
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,700
What gets to your ear is
incredibly impoverished, and

151
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,790
the rest of your brain has to
brilliantly reconstruct what

152
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:30,370
it heard and assign
its meaning.

153
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,430
And so part of the challenge of
your mind and brain to do

154
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,430
that is this.

155
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,660
This is a representation of
something like the physical

156
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,190
signal that arrives
at your ear.

157
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,190
And you could say, well,
here's one word.

158
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:41,850
Here's another word.

159
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,260
What's the problem?

160
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,410
But this is all the signal that
arrives at your ear for

161
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,840
the word captain.

162
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:54,450
So here's the C, all this stuff
for the A, a period of

163
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:58,370
long silence that sets
up the P. Turns out--

164
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,220
I'll convince you of
this in a moment--

165
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,970
that our speech is full within
words of silent breaks that

166
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:07,150
are incredibly informative and
alter our perception of what's

167
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,630
physically going on.

168
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,630
Then the little T. This
long stuff for the AI.

169
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,200
This long stuff for the N.

170
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,720
So the physical signal to your
ear barely resembles what

171
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,190
seems like a single
unit, captain.

172
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,740
And where's that pause?

173
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,450
A person doesn't say, "cap," or
doesn't say "ca," one, two,

174
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,380
three, "ptain." Right?

175
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,630
I mean, but the pause is
happening, and it's incredibly

176
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,690
informative, as I'll show you.

177
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,890
So that's the incredible
thing.

178
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:37,220
Your auditory system, your
language system, has to

179
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,030
reconstruct sound into
phonemes, into words.

180
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:45,760
It's not obvious in the physical
signal of the ear.

181
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,340
It's not even that the physical
signal at the ear

182
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,090
gives you much information at
the outset about whether

183
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,680
you're hearing one word or
two words or three words.

184
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,520
So here's "what," and "do you
mean" as one big blend.

185
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,150
Where is "do"?

186
00:07:59,150 --> 00:07:59,850
Where is "you"?

187
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:00,630
Where is "you mean"?

188
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,930
And why does "what" look so
separate, and these three

189
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:08,040
words, "what do you mean,"
get all garbled together.

190
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,670
And you have to unpack them
by your brain and mind.

191
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,230

192
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,870
Here's another example.

193
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,060
John said that the dog
snapped at them.

194
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,370
The dog snapped.

195
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,000
Here's what's coming, roughly,
to your ear,

196
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,310
taken from spoken speech.

197
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:26,610
And here, again, notice that
the boundaries that you can

198
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:31,380
see here, the gaps of silence,
occur not very related to the

199
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,690
boundaries between the words
that your mind ultimately

200
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:34,799
understands.

201
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,740
So here's the word
"the," "dog".

202
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,750
Here's S for "snapped".

203
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,940
Here's a good pause.

204
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,809
But that's a pause between the
P sound and the T sound.

205
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:45,650
That looks like a good
word boundary.

206
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,750
To a machine, that's a very
good word boundary.

207
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,440
It's not a word boundary
for you.

208
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,290
You know snapped is one word.

209
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,090
And here comes "at." "At" is
kind of blended into the T. So

210
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:59,090
there's this physical signal
doesn't even give you breaks

211
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,800
where words separate
from one another.

212
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:07,230
It's kind of a continuous mix
of breaks and silences.

213
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:12,090
So here's to convince you that
a silence carries incredible

214
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,560
information in it.

215
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,050
Let's see, make sure
I have the volume.

216
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,570
OK, so I'm going to
play you this.

217
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:23,850
This is a physical signal to
your ear of the word "say."

218
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:24,970
RECORDING: Say.

219
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,330
PROFESSOR: OK.

220
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,670
Yeah?

221
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,460
I always worry because Tyler's
an expert in this, and I'm

222
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,250
always like, please,
Tyler, don't

223
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,310
embarrass me when I'm wrong.

224
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,520
You don't have this pressure
out there, but the teaching

225
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,270
assistants are all experts
in something or another.

226
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,690
And then they know more often
than I do on that topic, and

227
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:42,860
we hit their topic
in the course.

228
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,910
I'm looking over there
nervously.

229
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,150
So here's "say." Now, they're
going to take this thing and

230
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,980
just separate this, just in
the way you do a physical

231
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,450
signal on a computer, just
separate in time.

232
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,290
They're just going to add
a little bit of time.

233
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:58,280
And what do you hear?

234
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,880
RECORDING: Stay.

235
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,390
PROFESSOR: The T sound that
makes is simply adding silence

236
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,010
here to produce that.

237
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,140
Now, that's what you
hear all the time.

238
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,380
It's not a random choice.

239
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,470
But isn't that amazing?

240
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,240
That silence is as ultimately
informative for your mind as

241
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,060
actual language sounds
themselves.

242
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,200
All this is happening on the
order of thousandths of a

243
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,595
second, in bits of
information.

244
00:10:19,595 --> 00:10:22,130

245
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:22,870
That's bad enough.

246
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,670
Here's another amazingly
tough thing.

247
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:28,440
So people like to compare
consonants that have a lot of

248
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,060
similarities with some
interesting differences.

249
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,640
Ba and da.

250
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,940
This is really comparing B
versus D. It's throwing on the

251
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,650
A just to have a vowel sound.

252
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,260
So here, again, is a
representation of what's

253
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,820
coming to your ear.

254
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,580
Notice that all the difference
between the B and the D, these

255
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,440
two consonants, all the physical
differences occurring

256
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,070
in 40,000ths of a second.

257
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:51,210
40,000ths of a second is all the
physical difference that

258
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,990
you get as you hear
these two things.

259
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:56,720

260
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,660
RECORDING: Ba.

261
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,440
Da.

262
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,530
PROFESSOR: 40,000ths of a
second, and yet you could hear

263
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,980
the word bad, and you're
not going bad, dab.

264
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,790
Come on, that was thousandths
of a second, right?

265
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,220
And not only that, there'd be
another word and another word

266
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:11,860
in a sentence.

267
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,490
That's why people use the word
speech stream, and we like to

268
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,970
think of it as a
speech torrent.

269
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:20,610
Phonemes, phonemes, phonemes,
breaks, all garbled together

270
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,480
in your mind as you back and
constantly, instantly, and

271
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,050
brilliantly figure out
what you've heard.

272
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,910
So let me give you another
example because part of the

273
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:34,630
challenge of this are phonemes
occur in the context of words

274
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,370
and sentences.

275
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,800
So make sure I have good
volume on this.

276
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,080
OK, so let's do this
first one.

277
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,130
RECORDING: [INAUDIBLE].

278
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,334
PROFESSOR: What was that?

279
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:42,806
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

280
00:11:42,806 --> 00:11:43,278
PROFESSOR: What?

281
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:44,700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

282
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,510
PROFESSOR: OK.

283
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,700
Here's the same thing, and a
person is going to say this

284
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,790
now all by itself.

285
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,700
RECORDING: Little.

286
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,680
PROFESSOR: You got
that, right?

287
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,526
OK.

288
00:11:56,526 --> 00:11:59,040
RECORDING: Mary saw the three
little pigs in the corridor.

289
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,460
PROFESSOR: OK, but here's
the amazing thing.

290
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,990
The first sound you heard, and
I'll replay it, they took the

291
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,170
word little, and they cut
it out from the last

292
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,020
sentence you heard.

293
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,490
When little is said all by
itself, what comes to your ear

294
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,730
is literally the first
thing you heard.

295
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:20,120
Not this, because when you say
a word in isolation, little,

296
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,490
people say it differently.

297
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,080
But we almost never
talk like that.

298
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,110
We almost always have
a sentence.

299
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:29,200
And it turns out the way we say
things, and therefore, the

300
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,130
way you hear things, is hugely
influenced by what comes

301
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,910
before it and what
comes after it.

302
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,810
Never mind things like the
speed at which different

303
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:40,920
people talk, the accent they
talk, or the loudness of the

304
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,810
background conversation.

305
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,286
But just simply the fact
that you're going to

306
00:12:45,286 --> 00:12:46,700
say little by itself.

307
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,500
How does that work?

308
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,620
It's amazing, right?

309
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,340
Listen again.

310
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,050
If you heard little all by
itself, and it's exactly the

311
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,300
same physical signal.

312
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,834

313
00:12:56,834 --> 00:12:57,302
Maybe it's not so--

314
00:12:57,302 --> 00:12:58,710
RECORDING: [INAUDIBLE].

315
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,720
PROFESSOR: OK?

316
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,132
Let me try that again.

317
00:13:01,132 --> 00:13:03,180
RECORDING: [INAUDIBLE].

318
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,350
PROFESSOR: That's exactly the
same physical signal, exactly

319
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,330
the same physical signal, as--

320
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:10,180
RECORDING: Mary saw the three
little pigs in the corridor.

321
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,650
PROFESSOR: What you
hear easily as

322
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:12,850
little is exactly that.

323
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:13,910
Words in isolation--

324
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,250
and there's a great
demonstration.

325
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,900
If you hear a word cut out, the
reason why it sounds like

326
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,710
nothing is your mind is already
preparing how to

327
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,790
interpret that, given what you
heard just before it, and also

328
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:28,080
a little bit what you
hear just after it.

329
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,370
Your mind is constantly fixing
up things because it knows

330
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,240
what's going on, what's going
into it, what's coming out.

331
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,240
It's not because it just simply
hears the word itself.

332
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,480
If we lived in a world where
people just say one word every

333
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,270
half an hour, we
could do this.

334
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,320
In a world where we're talking
to each other in sentences all

335
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,190
the time, we have to do this.

336
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,870

337
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,030
Here's another example of our
brilliant auditory system for

338
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,280
hearing these kinds of things.

339
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,620
So again, these are
representations of how this

340
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,040
physical signal arrives
at your ear.

341
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,050
Here's the word bet, bee,
boat, and bird.

342
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,390
They all start with
the same B sound.

343
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,350
That's easy, right?

344
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,020
But look what came
to your ear.

345
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,350
Look at this signal, this
signal, this signal.

346
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:09,950
Look at this one.

347
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,950
How different does this look?

348
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:15,900
It's different because what
follows bird influences how

349
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,250
this is said, but you can see
that you can translate both of

350
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,440
these into the B sound
pretty easily.

351
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,260
Now, look at these words.

352
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,680
These all start with D. Look
at how bet and debt look

353
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,540
almost identical.

354
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,000
We said it's only 40
milliseconds difference,

355
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,050
40,000ths of a second difference
that physically

356
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,080
moved through your ear.

357
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,920
But you can tell the word
bet versus debt.

358
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,030
Look at the word D, how
different it looks

359
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,840
from word to word.

360
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,720
So your mind is constantly
figuring

361
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,120
out what you're hearing.

362
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,370
The problem of invariance, and
it's constantly coming to you

363
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,650
in incredibly variable ways.

364
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:51,170

365
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:54,550
So one of the tools we have, and
an amazing human capacity,

366
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,820
is what's called categorical
perception.

367
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,780
So we have all this huge range
of physical sounds that can

368
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,050
come to our ear.

369
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,650
And kind of brilliantly,
and you don't

370
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:03,480
even think about it--

371
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,170
I mean, none of you go around
bragging about your

372
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,900
categorical perception
abilities, right?

373
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,070
Like when you go to spring
break, right?

374
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,340
And maybe some of you will go
home, or you'll see friends,

375
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,740
and you won't go, I have
categorical perception.

376
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,600
I try to be modest about it.

377
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,290
But it's an amazing human
talent, and essential because

378
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,420
what it does is this.

379
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,310
We hear this huge range of
sounds, depending on accents,

380
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,040
what comes before,
what comes after.

381
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,530
And we have to decide that's a
B. And what you're going to do

382
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:32,270
is take this huge range of
things, and just go, boom.

383
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:35,360
It's a B or a D, and that's
all there is to it.

384
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,290
So here's the way they do it.

385
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,890
So categorical perception.

386
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,480
Sounds can vary continuously.

387
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,460
We showed you some of
this continuity.

388
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,060
In this experiment, on purpose,
they're going to vary

389
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,420
sounds in a very continuous,
physical way.

390
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:53,800
But in our heads, for ba and da
here, in our heads, all the

391
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,290
stuff that's over here, even
though they're very different

392
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,690
one from the other at a
physical, specific level,

393
00:15:58,690 --> 00:15:59,700
we'll say, ba.

394
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,360
I'm done with it.

395
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,250
We're going to put it in one
category for interpretation.

396
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,750
And you're going to have a
pretty sharp boundary here.

397
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,510
And then everything over here,
all these physical signals,

398
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,780
you're going to call pa.

399
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,020
And so you're not going to spend
a lot of time going,

400
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,720
that was a one third ba,
2/3 pa, probability.

401
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,690
You couldn't do that, right?

402
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:17,690
Because you couldn't
get through a

403
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:18,680
word, nevermind a sentence.

404
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,760
You're going to instantly group
huge numbers of things

405
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,520
that are different from one
another into two categories

406
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,470
that need to be separated.

407
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,360
So here's a kind of experiment
they do.

408
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,670
I'll just give you the
feeling of it.

409
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,070
Here's what they're varying,
constant units.

410
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:35,350
Constant units, every stimulus
here is different.

411
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:38,335
But every time you hear ba, and
they're constantly going

412
00:16:38,335 --> 00:16:40,900
to vary something by its
physical property, you always

413
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:45,910
call it a B. And then something
happens, in about 20

414
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:49,360
milliseconds of information, and
boom, you always call it a

415
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,070
P. So change, change, change,
change, change, in the

416
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:56,340
physical signal, you call
it one category.

417
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,150
A little bit more
change, boom.

418
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,540
It's the other category.

419
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,940
And you keep changing, but for
you, it's always a perfectly

420
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:06,079
good P, even though every one
of those are different.

421
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,310
So it's an amazing fundamental
capacity to take a huge, and,

422
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:13,260
for all practical purposes, an
infinite variety of inputs and

423
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:17,520
say it's a B or a P if that's
the world I'm working in.

424
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,190
Syntax.

425
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,619
That's another way in which we
understand things, the way

426
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:23,010
that words are organized
and the order.

427
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:25,839
So we could say, "The model
embraced the designer and the

428
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,569
photographer." Imagine somebody
saying to this.

429
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:30,240
But then they complete the
sentence, "The model embraced

430
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,070
the designer and the
photographer laughed."

431
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,890
So people who study syntax
really are interested in what

432
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,180
happens in your mind as you
hear, "The model embraced the

433
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,600
designer and the photographer,"
and some big

434
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,420
group hug is going on, right?

435
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,130
And then all of a sudden, you
get this word laughed, and you

436
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,210
have to rearrange the elements
in your mind.

437
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,020
That's what syntax is letting
you do, to say, oh, the

438
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,620
meaning is really
quite different.

439
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,560
There's only one hug going on,
and one person laughing at

440
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,210
them, right?

441
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:58,090
But the meaning over time as
somebody talks to you set up,

442
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,030
you're thinking this, boom.

443
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:05,150
Because you understand syntax,
you understand what happens.

444
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,870
Semantics are kind of more
straightforward than how we

445
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,190
usually think about them.

446
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:12,880
They're the meaning of words
or sentences, morphemes.

447
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,640
And we can understand semantics
even when the

448
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,850
sentence is nonsense. "Colorless
green ideas sleep

449
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:19,330
furiously" is a famous
example.

450
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,930
We can understand semantics
even in bad grammatical

451
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,020
sentences, right?

452
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:27,050
"Fastly eat dinner, ballgame
start soon." Your fifth grade

453
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:31,190
teacher would be up in arms to
hear that, but you understand.

454
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:31,660
Eat now.

455
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,690
Go see the ball game.

456
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,390
So we get through a lot of
stuff to get semantics.

457
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,460
And we can see interactions.

458
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,820
I stole this example from Ted
Gibson because it took me 20

459
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,170
minutes to figure out what
the sentence means.

460
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,420
You're probably faster
than I am.

461
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:48,791

462
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,600
Are you OK?

463
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,060
I'm like the old man.

464
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,820
Where's the missing words?

465
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,730
The old man the boats.

466
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,270
So this is how you have to
parse up the sentence.

467
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,450
It's not always obvious.

468
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,240
People who study language love
these things, where people are

469
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,580
all confused.

470
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,320
Most of our lives, we don't go
through that much confusion.

471
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,470
But there's some fun ones,
sort of like the visual

472
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:10,340
illusions, to point out how
meaning and syntax can

473
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,590
interact as you figure
out things.

474
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,920
Here's another example.

475
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,330
Jay Leno talked about sex
with Lindsey Lohan.

476
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,350
OK, now wait a minute.

477
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:21,845
Did I miss that excellent
episode of Jay Leno, or was

478
00:19:21,845 --> 00:19:23,730
she on the show, and talking
about-- she was saying I'd

479
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,480
rather not talk about my
recent conviction.

480
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,170
I'd rather talk about something
less controversial.

481
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,720
So semantic.

482
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,900
All these things are constantly

483
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,810
interacting in your mind.

484
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,740
It's kind of amazing when you
think about that, right?

485
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,090
We said phonology's amazing.

486
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,910
Semantics, syntax, boom.

487
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,050
They're all happening in you.

488
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,220
And none of you are
sitting there,

489
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,830
going, just do phonology.

490
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,570
Please don't ask me
to do semantics.

491
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:45,910
We just had midterms, right?

492
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,570
Brilliant.

493
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,780
So one of the ways that people
try to convince themselves

494
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,530
that these things are separable
and gives a little

495
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,990
bit more insight is Evoked
Response Potentials.

496
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,560
Those are these things that you
can measure on infants or

497
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,910
adults that measure electrical
activity in milliseconds and

498
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:04,610
the speed of language
processing, surface electrodes

499
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:10,260
that give you an index of a few
hundred thousand neurons.

500
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,280
And this is an example you saw
before, actually, earlier in

501
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,280
the course, the so-called
N400.

502
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,590
So N means whether the
wave is going up or

503
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,900
down, negative or positive.

504
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,200
400 means that it occurs about
400 milliseconds, about half a

505
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,410
second, after the
relevant event.

506
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:31,380
So here is this, let's see, it
was his first day at work.

507
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,280
That's the baseline.

508
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,550
He spread the warm
bread with socks.

509
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,360
Oh my gosh, socks.

510
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,160
Semantically bad.

511
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,760
And here comes the N400.

512
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,080
And the control condition is you
throw up this unexpected

513
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,900
word, shoes, that's weird, but
not semantically, and you get

514
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,890
quite a different response.

515
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:50,520
So here's an N400 that seems
to simply be about semantic

516
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,690
expectation or congruence.

517
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:57,110
How about if you
mess up syntax?

518
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:02,780
The spoiled child throw
the toys on the box.

519
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:06,460
Then you get a response at
about 600 milliseconds to

520
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,270
syntactic incongruity.

521
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:11,740
So people, this is just more
evidence that in the brain,

522
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,720
meaning or semantics and syntax
or something about word

523
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,470
order are processed somewhat
differently in time and place.

524
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,600
Pragmatics is kind of fun.

525
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,410
It's practical understanding.

526
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,660
The old joke, do you know
what time it is?

527
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,990
And the person says, yes.

528
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,705
They're messing with your
sense of pragmatics.

529
00:21:27,705 --> 00:21:30,380

530
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,800
Two negatives make a positive.

531
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,590
Saying, yeah, yeah.

532
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,750
I've heard that one before,
earlier in the lecture.

533
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,860
Now, here's something kind of
interesting, again, which is

534
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,195
remarkable.

535
00:21:38,195 --> 00:21:40,920
And if you didn't do the
experiment, you couldn't know

536
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,450
that our mind is like this.

537
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:45,370
Because you wouldn't do things
like this because it sounds

538
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:48,090
too ridiculous, but your mind
does it all the time.

539
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:51,300
So we're going to think about
the word "bugs." And I have to

540
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,570
set you up a little bit with
paradigms you've heard before,

541
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,490
but just remind you
of these things.

542
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:59,660
So one kind of task that
psychologists like to use to

543
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,410
think about how people
process words is a

544
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,850
lexical decision task.

545
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:07,790
All you're deciding is whether
a word is a real word or a

546
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,340
nonsense word.

547
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,580
So doctor is real.

548
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,530
Poctor is not.

549
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,950
Spy is a real word.

550
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:15,250
This spelling is not
a real word.

551
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,700
So real word, not a real word.

552
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,420
We also talked about one other
idea early in the course, that

553
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:24,440
if, prior to processing a word
like doctor, you get an

554
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,500
unrelated word or a related
word, you process doctor

555
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,120
faster if you had a related
word before it.

556
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,870
Semantic priming.

557
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:33,260
The ideas about nurse
overlap a lot with

558
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,840
the ideas about doctor.

559
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,150
And seeing this word
before makes you

560
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,810
process this word faster.

561
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,490
So you need those two
things in mind.

562
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,730
What was the person doing?

563
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,110
Is it a real word or not?

564
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,060
And you're going to mess with
what's in their mind before

565
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,980
that, related or unrelated.

566
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,280
And here's the experiment.

567
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,750
So you would hear, over
headphones, something like

568
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,730
this, as an example.

569
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,760
"Rumor has it that for years
the government building had

570
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,910
been plagued with
problems." Now,

571
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,510
here's a critical sentence.

572
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,560
"The man was not surprised when
he found several spiders,

573
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:05,330
roaches, and other bugs in
the corner of his room."

574
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,550
So there's two senses of the
word, at least two meanings of

575
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,740
the word bug, right?

576
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:12,870
The insect you don't want in
your soup, or the microphone

577
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,490
that somebody slipped into
your room to listen to

578
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:15,210
what's going on.

579
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:18,350
Two different meanings
for the word bug.

580
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,800
This is obviously about
the insect.

581
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,210
So the person is hearing this
over headphones, and on a

582
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:27,150
computer monitor in front of
them, after they hear the word

583
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:31,600
bugs here, they see, for a
lexical decision, the word

584
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,870
"ant," which is related to this
meaning, or "spy," which

585
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:38,120
is related to the other meaning
that's not relevant

586
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,110
for here, or "sew," which is
the control condition.

587
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,990
We'll ignore that because it's
just a control condition.

588
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,140
I'll ignore that for now.

589
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,220
So you're making a lexical
decision now on the related

590
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,680
meaning or the unrelated
meaning.

591
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,760
And here's what they find.

592
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,200
If it's the related meaning, and
you only have about a half

593
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,960
second from when that came on
to when you had to do this

594
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,770
task, so you saw the word
bug and here comes

595
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:03,290
this, you're faster.

596
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:07,100
But if you get the unrelated
meaning within a half a second

597
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:11,240
of processing the word,
you're also faster.

598
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,280
What this means is, your mind
has done exactly what you

599
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,800
would think it wouldn't do.

600
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,520
Your mind has looked up in
your brain, and in your

601
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,720
knowledge of vocabulary, every
meaning of the word.

602
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,310
Even though the sentence is
clearly setting you up for the

603
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:30,010
word, the insect meaning, every
meaning of your word is

604
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,440
turned on and available
to you.

605
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,290
Your mind does the opposite
of what you might think.

606
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,820
You might think, well, I know--

607
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,920
let's look at the sentence.

608
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,460
I know, once I get spiders,
roaches, and bugs.

609
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:42,010
By here, you know you're in the
insect world, not in the

610
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,950
world of spies, right?

611
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:50,170
But your mind, even then, looks
up every possible word.

612
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:53,840
Because it's cheaper for the
mind to look up every word

613
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,360
than to start to decide what
the appropriate word is.

614
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,780
And then, if you wait another
second and a half, you're only

615
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:04,900
fast for the selected meaning.

616
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,510
And now you're slowed
down for the one

617
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,100
that's not context relevant.

618
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,030
So your mind looks up everything
all the time.

619
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:13,310
Every meaning of every
word you know.

620
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,320
Every time that word pops up, it
seems like your mind looks

621
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,650
up every meaning, and then the
rest of your mind selects out

622
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,720
the one that's relevant
and shuts down the

623
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,150
ones that are not.

624
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:22,900
But you wouldn't think that.

625
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,280
You would think, maybe I'll
just get the one I need.

626
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:24,955
I'm not going to
get everything.

627
00:25:24,955 --> 00:25:27,110
It's like, I'm not going to put
all my clothes on, walk

628
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,960
outside, and take off everything
that's not relevant

629
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,620
for the weather, right?

630
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:34,070
It seems like a really
inefficient way to get

631
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,970
dressed, right?

632
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,760
But that's not the
way your mind is.

633
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,950
Your mind is cheaper and more
efficient to look up every

634
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:42,410
meaning every time, and then
pick the right one.

635
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:45,400
It's more efficient, and that's
how people do it.

636
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,850
So people use this word
exhaustive lexical access.

637
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,670
I look up every meaning of a
word, and then I'll pick out

638
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:51,920
the correct one.

639
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:56,720

640
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,920
Another interesting aspect that
could be brought into

641
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,700
pragmatics, and we'll talk a
little bit more about this

642
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,860
later in the course, but
emotional intonation.

643
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,910
And it turns out where it's
almost all language processes

644
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,620
are left dominance as
we talked about many

645
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,140
times in the course.

646
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:15,980
One stream of processing
language, both visual and

647
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,570
auditory, is right hemisphere
dependent.

648
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,690
And that's emotional
intonation.

649
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:23,620
And that brings us to
our reading for

650
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,030
today, from Oliver Sacks.

651
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,410
And I have to say, I think
Oliver Sacks is a phenomenal

652
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:31,280
author, but there's always been
this sense of some of

653
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,920
these stories are just a bit
too true to be-- just a bit

654
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,870
cute, or whatever it is.

655
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:39,920
And so for years, I taught
from this story, and I

656
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,860
believed it's likely true.

657
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,270
But I thought, well, it's
just a little cute.

658
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,550
And then came an experiment
that showed it's not only

659
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,650
cute, but it's exactly
correct.

660
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:53,680
So for this, you appreciate this
a bit more if you know a

661
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,220
couple things about Ronald
Reagan, who was

662
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,400
president in the 1980s.

663
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,380
So what do you guys know
about Ronald Reagan?

664
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,702
What party?

665
00:27:01,702 --> 00:27:02,200
AUDIENCE: Republican.

666
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,540
PROFESSOR: There you go.

667
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,710
Was he considered a
good communicator?

668
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:07,670
AUDIENCE: Yes.

669
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:08,150
PROFESSOR: Yes.

670
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:09,750
He was considered-- you know,
you can have all kinds of

671
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,260
views on Ronald Reagan's
things.

672
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,270
The public said, he's an
awesome communicator.

673
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,322
In fact, Barack Obama said he
would like to communicate like

674
00:27:15,322 --> 00:27:16,880
Ronald Reagan.

675
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,930
Whether that's to get Republican
votes or not,

676
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,210
that's your judgment.

677
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:22,520
But he was considered an
excellent communicator.

678
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:27,280
Was he considered, by and large,
to be an extremely

679
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:31,530
analytic thinker?

680
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:32,680
He might have been.

681
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,210
I don't know him.

682
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,200
But not so much.

683
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,225
Now, part of this is the
prejudice or not, but he was

684
00:27:36,225 --> 00:27:41,630
from California, and he was
an actor before he became

685
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,200
president, or the governor
president.

686
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,290
He also had some degree of--

687
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,040
well, he ultimately got
Alzheimer's disease.

688
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,750
It's a question about later in
his administration, whether he

689
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,690
was already working his
way towards that.

690
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:53,810
So anyway, complicated things.

691
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,890
So he was a master communicator,
but not

692
00:27:55,890 --> 00:28:00,410
necessarily the Barack Obama,
Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter

693
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:04,450
version of an analytic power,
is the general perception.

694
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:05,670
You never know whether
these are right or

695
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:08,050
wrong for the person.

696
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:10,840
But in the story, listening to
the president's speech, are

697
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,220
patients with aphasia that
Oliver Sacks described, and

698
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:16,460
he's getting laughter as they're
watching his speech.

699
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:20,100
And what happens is, some of
the people with a left

700
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,940
hemisphere lesion-- so you
have a language problem.

701
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,980
We'll see a video of that
pretty shortly.

702
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:30,740
They're laughing because they
think that the way he's

703
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,600
talking and his facial

704
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,030
expressions, they find hilarious.

705
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:36,510
Now, why do they find
it hilarious?

706
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:38,370
They have damage to the parts
of the brain that help them

707
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:40,570
understand the content of
his message on the left

708
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,450
hemisphere.

709
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:44,260
And here's what Sacks
thinks is going on.

710
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,370
"The feelings I have, which
all of us who work closely

711
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:51,660
with aphasics have, is that you
cannot lie to an aphasic.

712
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:56,050
He cannot grasp your words, and
so be deceived by them.

713
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:58,820
But what he grasps, he grasps
with infallible precision,

714
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,610
namely, the expression that
goes with the words, that

715
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:04,920
total spontaneous, involuntary
expressiveness which can never

716
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:09,250
be simulated or faked, or
words alone can hide all

717
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,950
sometimes too easily."

718
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:14,890
So when you give a very public
speech, especially under tough

719
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:17,960
circumstances, that presidents
sometimes have to do, we

720
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,160
sometimes think there's a
tension between exactly what

721
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,260
they're saying and exactly
what they're thinking.

722
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,560
And what they feel they need to
say, and exactly what they

723
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,340
know is behind the scenes.

724
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:31,070
And so the idea is that these
aphasics, they were saying

725
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:33,570
this guy obviously doesn't
mean what he's saying.

726
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:34,530
Look at his face.

727
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,160
Look at his tone.

728
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,780
I don't know what he's saying,
but it's hilarious, how he's

729
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,800
masking his face and speaking
in a funny tone to tell

730
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,510
something he truly
doesn't believe.

731
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,860
That's their interpretation.

732
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,850
And yet, he has an opposite
patient, a patient with a

733
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:48,900
right hemisphere lesion.

734
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,750
We said that's the side of
the hemisphere that seems

735
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,920
important for facial expressions
and emotional

736
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,780
intonation.

737
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:58,520
And she complains about the
logic of the case he's making,

738
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,910
as if having--

739
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:01,430
normally, when we talk to
somebody, it's both.

740
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,160
Left hemisphere's getting
the content,

741
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,360
analyzing the content.

742
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,450
Right hemisphere, something
about the intonation.

743
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,855
True or not true?

744
00:30:07,855 --> 00:30:10,210
Are their eyes like this, and
they can't even face us as

745
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:12,705
they tell us something
they know is false.

746
00:30:12,705 --> 00:30:14,920
But these patients, maybe
because they have one channel

747
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,385
of information knocked out
because of injury, they become

748
00:30:18,385 --> 00:30:21,050
hypersensitive to
the other one.

749
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:24,420
So I thought, well, that
sounds fantastically

750
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,570
interesting, but is
that really true?

751
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:28,870
So here in Boston, they did a
study with a large number of

752
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:32,650
patients that says they had
superior identification of

753
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:35,550
people who are lying to you--

754
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:38,040
they had made video clips and
audio clips of people who are

755
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,520
lying to you--

756
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,400
if they had a left hemisphere
lesion.

757
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,870
So this is a paper.

758
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,180
So here's the two examples.

759
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,880
So they have an example.

760
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,350
Let's pick this one.

761
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,090
Where both, you see
just a facial

762
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:52,980
expression of a person talking.

763
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,800
The voice is turned down.

764
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,930
Your job is to decide whether
a person is lying or not.

765
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:00,260
And some videos they're lying.

766
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,470
Some videos they're not.

767
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,640
So how would you do?

768
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,840
I don't know how you would do,
but I can tell you how a group

769
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,790
of Harvard undergraduates did.

770
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:11,390
50% is chance, and here's
how they did.

771
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:13,410
That was one of their
control groups.

772
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:16,160
And, in fact, for studies like
this, they brought in many,

773
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:21,310
many kinds of people to ask
whether anybody is better.

774
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:24,240
Everybody's pretty much terrible
at directly telling

775
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,270
whether a lie is going on.

776
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,250
Now, these are video clips of
people you don't know in

777
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,410
circumstances you don't know.

778
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:29,370
That could matter.

779
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:31,660
But everybody's terrible
at that.

780
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,440
Policemen are terrible.

781
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,150
FBI agents are terrible.

782
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:37,720
The only group that seems to be
above chance, and not much

783
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,640
above it, are Secret
Service agents.

784
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,140
So if you're friend with a
Secret Service agent, and you

785
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,740
want to deceive them, keep in
mind that they seem to be

786
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,380
above chance.

787
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,530
They're not awesome, but
they're above chance.

788
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,030
But look who's doing better than
everybody, patients with

789
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:52,380
the left hemisphere lesions.

790
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,610
And the interpretation
is, all the content

791
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:57,040
of the lie is gone.

792
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,550
All they see is your expression,
or your expression

793
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,940
and intonation.

794
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,400
And because that's all they have
to go on, they can tell

795
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,340
more when you have the
discomfort of lying than a

796
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:10,800
person who's partly persuaded by
hearing the message you're

797
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,380
sending as you talk.

798
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,820
So I thought this was an overly
cute example, but it

799
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:18,170
turns out to be exactly
replicable in a full study.

800
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,420
Any questions about that?

801
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,970

802
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:24,120
OK.

803
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,690
So let's talk a little
bit about the

804
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:26,840
brain basis of language.

805
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,680
We've talked a little
bit about--

806
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,910
we know that if you have damage
here, you have Broca's

807
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:33,240
aphasia on the left hemisphere,

808
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,390
trouble producing language.

809
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:37,610
Damage here, Wernicke's
aphasia, trouble

810
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:38,860
comprehending language.

811
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:42,010

812
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:45,070
To a first approximation, and
there's a lot of research that

813
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:47,960
has made this much more
complicated, but a first

814
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,190
approximation, the lesions
are in frontal

815
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:52,120
cortex or temporal cortex.

816
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,730
The speech in these patients are
what's called non-fluent

817
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:55,530
or telegraphic.

818
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:57,690
They get single words out but
have a hard time with anything

819
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:58,390
like a sentence.

820
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:00,820
It can be very frustrating
for these patients.

821
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,520
Wernicke's patients
seem much happier.

822
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,650
You'll see a film in a moment.

823
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,690
Their speech is fluent,
but it's

824
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:09,100
amazingly empty of content.

825
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,010
These patients have trouble
producing speech, but their

826
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:12,720
comprehension is decent.

827
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,310
These patients produce speech
pretty well, but their

828
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,050
comprehension.

829
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:20,320
So they're mirror opposites.

830
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,400
And let's see, what do I want?

831
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:21,970
Yes.

832
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:26,620
So in this field, a frequently,
incredibly

833
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:29,240
frequently used picture
to study aphasia is

834
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,710
this specific picture.

835
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,610
It's called the cookie
theft picture.

836
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,660
Why it's become widely used,
I'm not exactly sure.

837
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:38,920
But once it's widely used, then
often everybody uses it.

838
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,620
So they'll put a picture like
this in front of an

839
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,940
individual, and they'll
ask them to describe

840
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:44,530
what's going on.

841
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:46,710
It's to elicit production.

842
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:50,275
And you would say something
like, there's two kids.

843
00:33:50,275 --> 00:33:51,860
The kid's on a stool.

844
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,020
Uh oh, is he going
to fall over?

845
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,830
Because they're falling off
the cookie jar, and the

846
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,280
mother's sort of not
paying attention.

847
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,370
Her mind must be somewhere else
because she's letting the

848
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,310
water splish splash
here, right?

849
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,810
You would say something
like that.

850
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:05,150
So let's see what patients with
aphasia say, and other

851
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,960
examples of their difficulty
with language.

852
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:16,400

853
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,674
Yeah?

854
00:34:17,674 --> 00:34:20,290
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

855
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:23,100
PROFESSOR: Their writing tends
to go pretty much with their

856
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,840
spoken language.

857
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,310
That's a really good question
about-- so the question is,

858
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,699
what would their writing
be like?

859
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:33,952
It very much parallels their
spoken language.

860
00:34:33,952 --> 00:34:34,430
Yeah?

861
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:37,256
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

862
00:34:37,256 --> 00:34:38,130
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

863
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:38,990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

864
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,280
sign language?

865
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,830
PROFESSOR: OK, so very
good question.

866
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:46,030
Could not fluent aphasics learn
sign language to bypass,

867
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,780
in a sense, their
problem, right?

868
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,020
So I'm about to answer
that in a moment,

869
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,360
right on the next slide.

870
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,710
Not directly that, but the
implication of that.

871
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,610
Because the important thing is--
so let me show you this

872
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:57,220
thing, and let me come back.

873
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,650
The question is, could you train
an aphasic to use sign

874
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:02,700
language to get around his or
her language problem, if it's

875
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,770
a speech problem?

876
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:10,180
So people have studied sign
language as a language for

877
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,870
many reasons, but a
huge one is this.

878
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:15,560
Because I'm going to interpret
your question the way I need

879
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,000
to, and then you can tell me
if I did it right from your

880
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,310
perspective.

881
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:23,530
Which is, in what sense does
language equal speech?

882
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:27,010
Could you communicate
linguistically like, but just

883
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:30,300
switch to your hands, if for
some reason-- and the answer

884
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,290
is, that at the level of the
problem of these patients,

885
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:34,880
they could not do it.

886
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,800
Because these kinds of patients,
the problem isn't

887
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,810
really speech.

888
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:41,600
There are people who have
problems with the motor

889
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,730
apparatus to move their mouth.

890
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:44,900
That does exist.

891
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:48,040
Their problem is in language
processes that produce your

892
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:53,200
speech intent, or language
processes that extract meaning

893
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,310
from sounds.

894
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:57,260
And those language processes
that produce what you want to

895
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:01,440
say, that comprehend what you
hear or read, those are the

896
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,420
same ones that are utilized,
as far as we understand,

897
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,870
whether you're producing
language in the typical, vocal

898
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:09,050
way, or in the less
typical, but

899
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:12,130
well-studied, way of sign language.

900
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:12,530
Does that make sense?

901
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:13,010
OK.

902
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:14,170
So you can't get around
it because

903
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:16,440
it's a language problem.

904
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,550
So both by brain imaging
evidence, for example, here

905
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:22,660
are patients who use sign
language turning on Broca's

906
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:25,490
area and Wernicke's area
on tasks that are about

907
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:26,575
comprehension and production.

908
00:36:26,575 --> 00:36:29,550
It's the same areas, whether
it's using your hands for sign

909
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:33,840
language or using your mouth to
talk or your ear to hear.

910
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,070
Further, there have been really
fun studies where they

911
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:39,960
took deaf infants and have
shown-- and it's not easy to

912
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,750
show, but I think most people
are convinced that they babble

913
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:43,370
with their hands.

914
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:45,530
The same way babies make
little sounds to get

915
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:46,260
themselves going.

916
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,720
We'll talk more about
infants in a moment.

917
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,030
Infants who grow up in an
environment where they only

918
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:55,430
learn sign language babble
with their hands because

919
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:58,880
speech, language is not about
your mouth talking.

920
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,420
It's about ideas that you can
communicate by your production

921
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,540
or comprehension, by your
hand or by your mouth.

922
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:08,860
So language is separable from
speech, because even without

923
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:12,010
speech, you communicate in very
much the same way, in

924
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:14,470
terms of sign language,
by many studies.

925
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,060
Yeah?

926
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:19,326
AUDIENCE: So does that mean that
people that [INAUDIBLE]

927
00:37:19,326 --> 00:37:22,650
imagined words or language?

928
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:23,405
PROFESSOR: Say that
again, sorry?

929
00:37:23,405 --> 00:37:25,283
AUDIENCE: Does that mean that
they also couldn't imagine

930
00:37:25,283 --> 00:37:26,209
words or language?

931
00:37:26,209 --> 00:37:27,135
PROFESSOR: Who couldn't?

932
00:37:27,135 --> 00:37:29,510
AUDIENCE: People with Broca's
area aphasia.

933
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:33,190

934
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:35,010
PROFESSOR: I don't think so.

935
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:36,720
We talked about this
before, that--

936
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,820
I may not be understanding your
question exactly, but--

937
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:42,890
in many ways, imagining
something is the same part of

938
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:43,890
the brain that does it.

939
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:45,800
When we imagine a face, we
turn on the parts of

940
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,720
our brain that sees.

941
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,300
I think when you imagine,
if you--

942
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,300
I do this sometimes.

943
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,510
I say, here's what I'm
going to say to that

944
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,220
person, in my head.

945
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,770
And I practice that
little speech.

946
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:58,740
That's this part of the brain
pretty much running.

947
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,800
There's just a last little step
of moving your mouth, but

948
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,270
from the discussion we're having
now, that's kind of a

949
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:06,050
superficial thing of
moving your mouth.

950
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:09,170
That's not speech planning,
speech thinking, speech

951
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:10,110
intentions.

952
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:14,130
Those are our core process for
production, for comprehension,

953
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:17,870
and I think imagined stuff
is exactly the same way.

954
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:18,650
Is that OK?

955
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:19,100
Yeah.

956
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,093
Yeah?

957
00:38:20,093 --> 00:38:22,804
AUDIENCE: So if they can't
really imagine language, then

958
00:38:22,804 --> 00:38:25,516
how do they-- what is
their thinking like?

959
00:38:25,516 --> 00:38:26,766
[INAUDIBLE]?

960
00:38:26,766 --> 00:38:30,460

961
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:35,030
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's a good--
so the question is, if

962
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:37,820
they have these troubles with
core language ideas,

963
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,870
abilities, what's their
thinking like?

964
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:43,660
I could just tell you, it's a
classic debate for humans, how

965
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,580
deeply language equals
thought.

966
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:48,420
But language [INAUDIBLE]
in a sense of speech.

967
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,790
It's just one of those things
that people debate a lot

968
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:53,000
because it depends what you mean
by these things in many

969
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,360
different ways.

970
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,490
But if language means something
like comprehending

971
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:00,290
ideas in the world, it's hard
to get around that for

972
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:01,560
thinking [INAUDIBLE].

973
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,360
It means planning actions in
the world that change the

974
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,190
world around you, and
communicating that, it's hard

975
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:11,410
to not have that capacity for
thinking in that way, right?

976
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:14,900
So it's at this level, not
whether you use your hands or

977
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,990
your mouth, it's very hard to
separate out what you might

978
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:21,310
call thought and what you
might call language.

979
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:23,550
But keep in mind that these
patients that we see, it's not

980
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:26,040
like they lost all of
language at all.

981
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,100
So even the Broca's aphasic
has trouble producing

982
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,040
language, he's producing
some, and he

983
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,420
comprehends it pretty well.

984
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,350
So it's not like these patients
have lost all of

985
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:35,840
their language circuitry, and
therefore don't have thought

986
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,820
available, right?

987
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:39,260
They have a lot of language left
in their head, and a lot

988
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,460
of thought left in their mind.

989
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:43,750
Is that OK?

990
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,865
So one interesting thing that
people have wondered, and

991
00:39:45,865 --> 00:39:47,770
where brain imaging gives us
evidence that we couldn't have

992
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:50,930
imagined 15 years
ago, is this.

993
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,180
So if you have damage, let's
say, here's a patient with

994
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:56,290
damage to the left
frontal area.

995
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:59,550
And they get better because
they've had a stroke here or

996
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:00,190
an injury here.

997
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,170
They get better.

998
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,850
A question that people have
wondered is, do they get

999
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:05,860
better by sort of somehow
recovering ability in a part

1000
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,470
of their brain that
got injured?

1001
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:10,120
Or do they get better because
they use an entirely different

1002
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,820
pathway in their brain?

1003
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,340
Now, until brain imaging,
you couldn't begin

1004
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,490
to touch that question.

1005
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:17,220
But now we have some evidence,
and I'll make it just--

1006
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:21,750
and so here's an example of a
patient who has damage here.

1007
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:25,190
They have him do a task that
in healthy people turns on

1008
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:28,330
exactly that place.

1009
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:30,780
And when he does it,
he can do it OK.

1010
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,950
And where does he do it?

1011
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,630
In his right hemisphere.

1012
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:36,865
So this patient seems to switch
which hemisphere he

1013
00:40:36,865 --> 00:40:37,730
uses for language.

1014
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:40,650
It takes time and training
to recover that.

1015
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:44,070
But it seems like he's found
an alternate pathway to

1016
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:46,900
produce a language somehow.

1017
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,920
Turns out that the more people
have studied these things, the

1018
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,980
more complicated it gets.

1019
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,260
Maybe just diversity of people,
diversity of injuries,

1020
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,140
or whatever.

1021
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,030
So it doesn't always
work this way.

1022
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:59,350
But often, it seems like when
people have better recovery

1023
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:02,990
from a large injury to the
speaking left hemisphere, they

1024
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:06,480
find a way, somehow, through
practice and training, to get

1025
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,100
the right hemisphere to take
over some of those

1026
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,350
responsibilities.

1027
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:12,080

1028
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,010
Language acquisition.

1029
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:15,920
So one of the most amazing
things about infants is they

1030
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,600
go from zero to speech in just
a couple of years, and go

1031
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,910
through an unbelievable training
and program of

1032
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,120
development.

1033
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,410
So what happens?

1034
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:28,060
In two or three months, they
perceive all the phonemes.

1035
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,130
They notice this change
in phonemes.

1036
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:32,510
By six months, they start to
ignore distinctions among

1037
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:34,130
sounds that are not used
in their language.

1038
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:36,680
In other words, other
language sounds.

1039
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,590
They start to babble, in
some way getting their

1040
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,050
speech ready to go.

1041
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:43,520
By eight months, they start to
identify single words in a

1042
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,570
speech stream.

1043
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,500
In a year, their babbling
becomes

1044
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,070
more adult-like sounding.

1045
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:51,880
But a little bit after that,
they get up to about 50 words

1046
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,070
in understanding.

1047
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:56,780
So comprehension always goes
ahead of production.

1048
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,920
Children understand words before
they can speak them.

1049
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,970
But they're lagging.

1050
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:02,030
Here comes a speech, telegraphic
speech, short

1051
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,610
sentences at two years.

1052
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:06,330
And then, finally, pretty
complete speech, in

1053
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:07,740
many ways, by nine.

1054
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:12,570
So it's a long, long process,
learning 10,000 words

1055
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:14,010
estimated by the age of six.

1056
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:16,470
That's a spectacular
learning curve.

1057
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:18,590
When they do experiments on
infants where they measure

1058
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:20,980
things like preference or
learning by sucking rates on a

1059
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,030
nipple because they can't talk,
they try to figure out,

1060
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:24,430
what is the infant hearing.

1061
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:27,920
Within two hours of birth, they
suck with more enthusiasm

1062
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,200
to their mother's voice
over another voice.

1063
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,410
These are infants, this
is their first

1064
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:32,930
visit to their mother.

1065
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:36,330
You have to sign up to
do this experiment.

1066
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:38,040
Now, they might have heard
their mother's voice in a

1067
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:44,200
certain way in the
womb, right?

1068
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,500
But they already have picked
up, by three-day-old, they

1069
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,050
prefer language to many other
sounds, like music.

1070
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:51,240
We come to love music, but
that's not the urgent business

1071
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,060
of the infant.

1072
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:55,780
By four days old, they start
to notice the differences

1073
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:56,930
between languages.

1074
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:59,180
This is amazing.

1075
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,050
Their rate of learning
is fantastic.

1076
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:03,810
And by two months, they can tell
the ba-ga distinction,

1077
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:07,350
subtle distinctions, 40
milliseconds information.

1078
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:09,970
And then they develop a
continuingly strong preference

1079
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:12,710
for the sounds of their
native language.

1080
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:15,760
Now, some years ago, people
debated endlessly this left

1081
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,800
hemisphere specialization
for language.

1082
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,320
This is fantastically essential

1083
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,990
and striking in humans.

1084
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:24,630
Does that grow over time,
or is it in your mind

1085
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:26,400
and brain at birth?

1086
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,080
And the evidence is pretty
compelling for many sources,

1087
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,430
but here is maybe the most.

1088
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:33,680
Here's fMRI on two-day-old
infants.

1089
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,630
You might ask, how do they
instruct the infants to lie

1090
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:39,110
still in the scanner and
participate in the experiment?

1091
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:43,110
And the answer is, at two days
old, infants mostly just lay

1092
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:44,410
there and don't do much.

1093
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:47,750

1094
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,390
They don't do much.

1095
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:49,590
And there's a lot going on in
their mind, but they don't

1096
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:51,390
have much physical apparatus
to do much.

1097
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:54,870
So you could swaddle them very
warmly, and just lay--

1098
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:57,050
you put them on a cradle
into the fMRI scanner.

1099
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:59,970
Their parents have signed
up for them.

1100
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,760
And you could play them sounds
while they just lay there and

1101
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,240
do nothing.

1102
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,180
They can't push buttons.

1103
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:04,980
They can't do stuff.

1104
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:06,640
But you can see what's happening
inside their brain.

1105
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,520
And at two days old, here's the
left hemisphere response

1106
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,220
to language compared
to the right.

1107
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:14,870
So it's there instantly,
we believe.

1108
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:17,740
It's been there, actually in the
womb as the child's been

1109
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:18,600
developing.

1110
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,470
This left hemisphere,
genetically set up dominance

1111
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:22,840
for language in almost
everybody.

1112
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,810

1113
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:29,330
fMRI, just for those
of you who--

1114
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:31,660
again, we can start doing it
at about age five, but from

1115
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:34,720
about three months to age five,
it's incredibly hard to

1116
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,530
do children in a scanner.

1117
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:39,410
But the first couple days,
it's not so hard.

1118
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:41,730
Now, a really interesting
line of research has

1119
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:42,750
talked about motherese.

1120
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:43,620
Have you heard this term?

1121
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:46,210
So how do grown-ups,
even college

1122
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:47,720
students, talk to babies?

1123
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,215
Do you talk to babies
just like you talk

1124
00:44:49,215 --> 00:44:50,600
to everybody else?

1125
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:51,850
No.

1126
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:53,790

1127
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:55,710
Cute baby.

1128
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:56,960
Baby, baby.

1129
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,210
And everybody looks like
an idiot, right?

1130
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:00,740

1131
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,850
And you could just think, OK,
that's just people being

1132
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:03,900
idiots around babies.

1133
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,690
But it turns out there's been
beautiful, beautiful studies

1134
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:10,290
to show that, while you
spontaneously do this-- and

1135
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:14,010
you and I don't take motherese
or fatherese courses--

1136
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:18,070
but what we do spontaneously
is that way of elongating

1137
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:22,520
sounds, the intonations we give,
are incredibly perfect

1138
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,340
to help the baby
learn language.

1139
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:27,710
We're exactly doing what
they can understand.

1140
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:29,770
And that, again, must
be virtually in

1141
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:31,610
our genes, I think.

1142
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:33,540
We hear it around,
so it's not zero.

1143
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:37,660
But the short pauses, careful
enunciation, exaggerated

1144
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,930
intonation, that's--

1145
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:41,880
you could do experiments where
you take language and you get

1146
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,380
rid of those, and the babies
are like-- they don't know

1147
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:43,860
what's going on.

1148
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:44,770
They're not interested.

1149
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:46,710
You put them back in, boom.

1150
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:48,950
Those are perfect
for the baby.

1151
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:52,610
It's amazing, not only how
babies are ready to go, but

1152
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:55,090
how adults who talk with
them are ready to go.

1153
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:58,210
I mean, it's just amazing.

1154
00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:01,240
None of us will ever be as good
a teacher in a classroom

1155
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,690
as all of you will be
with a baby anytime

1156
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:04,490
you talk with them.

1157
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:06,500
It's just amazing.

1158
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,260
So there's beautiful experiments
that show that

1159
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:11,950
every time you tinker with the
way the mother spontaneously,

1160
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:14,930
or parents spontaneously, talk
to indants, you make it worse,

1161
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:16,750
less interesting, and less
informative for the infant.

1162
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:19,400

1163
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,660
So now let's talk about a
more formal experiment.

1164
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:25,030
These are the classic experiment
that nailed home

1165
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:28,710
this message, that at birth
we're universal understanders

1166
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:30,260
of all sounds in the world.

1167
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:33,800
And as the years go along, we
became only good at the sounds

1168
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,220
that are relevant, that are
part of our own language.

1169
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:41,380
A famous example in the US is
a difficulty for Japanese

1170
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:43,600
native speakers for the
R-L distinction.

1171
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,660
But every language has some
distinctions it doesn't make,

1172
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:48,660
and they're really hard
when you get older.

1173
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:49,780
So here's the idea.

1174
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:53,450
In English, we make a
distinction between ba and da,

1175
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:55,800
and by 10 to 12 months, an
infant can make that

1176
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:56,660
distinction.

1177
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:57,990
And certainly, adults can.

1178
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:01,330
That's categorical perception
that we talked about, that

1179
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:04,990
kind of division between
ba and da.

1180
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:07,530
But there's sounds that occur
in other language.

1181
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:09,640
So we're shown here.

1182
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:10,680
And you're going to hear--

1183
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:13,060
some of you may know Hindi
sounds, and it'll be a

1184
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,850
different experience for you.

1185
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:17,760
Every year, when I first hear
this clip I'm about to show

1186
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,910
you, I think something's
wrong.

1187
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:21,640
Because they say, the infant's
going to tell the difference

1188
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,240
between da and da.

1189
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,500
And I go, well, how are
they going to do that?

1190
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,880
I can't do that.

1191
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,530
That's because they really are
different sounds you're

1192
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:31,570
hearing, but in English, they're
not different sounds.

1193
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:33,730
And so it all sounds
the same to me.

1194
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:35,540
I'm no longer a universal
learner.

1195
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:38,620
I haven't been since
quite a while.

1196
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:39,870
So here we go.

1197
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:43,750

1198
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:46,370
I'm stunned, always, by the
brilliance of infant

1199
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:50,080
researchers like this, who
somehow, pretty convincingly

1200
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:53,770
in most cases, really tell you
what the infant knows or pays

1201
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:56,103
attention to or thinks in pretty
compelling ways, even

1202
00:47:56,103 --> 00:47:59,290
though they can't tell
you themselves.

1203
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:01,310
So one thing that's come
up in the US--

1204
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:04,215
I mean, the whole world is
becoming ever more bilingual

1205
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:06,570
and trilingual.

1206
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:08,473
There used to be some concerns,
less now, and I'll

1207
00:48:08,473 --> 00:48:10,940
tell you, you don't have
to worry about it.

1208
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:13,200
Whether it's bad to learn
two languages at once

1209
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:13,870
when you're a kid.

1210
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:16,016
And some parents worry
about this, right?

1211
00:48:16,016 --> 00:48:17,510
You're going to be all messed
up because you're going to

1212
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:19,720
blend them all up and not
do well in school.

1213
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,345
And so there's been quite a
bit of research, actually,

1214
00:48:22,345 --> 00:48:25,270
tracking and asking whether
there's any downside.

1215
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:26,590
I mean, there's huge
upsides to knowing

1216
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:27,860
two or three languages.

1217
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:30,980
Are there any downsides in terms
of language development?

1218
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:35,540
And the objective evidence is
pretty compelling that for

1219
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:40,300
babbling, for first words, for
pairs of words at a time,

1220
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,680
[INAUDIBLE] at two months, that
there's really no cost.

1221
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,660
So they followed, in Canada, for
example, children who grew

1222
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:48,830
up learning English and French,
English and ASL,

1223
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:51,800
French or English only.

1224
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,270
Everybody does the same,
pretty much.

1225
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:56,950
There's no cost, compared
to the huge gain.

1226
00:48:56,950 --> 00:48:59,055
Sometimes some kids will
get a little mixed up.

1227
00:48:59,055 --> 00:49:01,470
They'll actually mix up
languages because they'll just

1228
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:03,860
mix them up when they're
pretty young.

1229
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:06,560
But there's no developmental
delay of milestones or

1230
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,700
negative consequences.

1231
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:10,920
There's only the benefit of
having two or three languages

1232
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:11,690
that you could speak.

1233
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:13,430
So the evidence is overwhelming,
empirically,

1234
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:15,920
that there's no cost for
learning more than one

1235
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,790
language at a time when
you're an infant.

1236
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:23,070
One thing, there is a cost, a
little bit, if you're a boy.

1237
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:25,020
So unknown why this happened.

1238
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:27,400
I don't think there's any
deep science about it.

1239
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,320
But everybody has observed that,
for example, number of

1240
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,560
new words understood during the
first two years of life,

1241
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:35,100
that girls, on average,
outperform boys in language

1242
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,350
acquisition early on.

1243
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:38,600
And then things get closer,
pretty much.

1244
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,500
But the rate of learning
on girls on average

1245
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,280
is faster than boys.

1246
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:46,570
Nobody, I think, understands
the specific basis of that.

1247
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:48,970
So when people talk about
critical periods in language

1248
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:52,930
acquisition, and what are
fragile or resilient aspects

1249
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:53,530
of language.

1250
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:56,320
Which aspects of learning
language that seem very

1251
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,910
dependent on the age you are,
and which are independent.

1252
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:02,380
So phonology, including the
production of language sounds,

1253
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:03,490
seems very fragile.

1254
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:05,510
Easy when you're young, harder
when you're older.

1255
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:07,990
Grammar is also age-sensitive,
making subtle grammatical

1256
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:10,080
distinctions.

1257
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:13,180
Learning about meaning or
vocabulary, you're perfectly

1258
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:14,140
fine when you're an adult.

1259
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:15,800
That doesn't seem to
show something

1260
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,290
like a sensitive period.

1261
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:19,390
And here's one famous study
that established

1262
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:19,980
some of these things.

1263
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:23,850
They looked at what age people
arrive to different countries,

1264
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:25,260
from different countries
to the US and

1265
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:26,300
started learning English.

1266
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:29,650
These are people that didn't
know English before.

1267
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:33,440
They're all adults now, and
they had them do quickly

1268
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,120
grammatical judgments.

1269
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,860
And what they found is, if you
came to the US when you--

1270
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:40,560
if you were born in the US, or
you came to the age three to

1271
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:43,650
seven, you were very
good at doing this.

1272
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:47,590
But the later you came here, 8
to 10 years of age, 11 to 15,

1273
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:52,270
17 to 39, your ability to make
these fast, subtle grammatical

1274
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:54,320
judgments just went down.

1275
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,165
Even though you've been here, in
many cases, for many years.

1276
00:50:56,165 --> 00:50:57,450
You're very smart.

1277
00:50:57,450 --> 00:50:58,770
Accents are like that, right?

1278
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:00,990
People come to the US at a
certain point in their

1279
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:01,960
development.

1280
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,580
They're very skilled in
English, have a big

1281
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:06,170
vocabulary, but the accent
never disappears.

1282
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:08,800
That's another thing in terms
of language production that

1283
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,250
has its fragile developmental
early period.

1284
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:13,810
So the last thing I'll do, and
then show you a movie for

1285
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:17,530
about eight minutes.

1286
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:20,190
We get this occasional
horrible experiments.

1287
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:21,650
It's not even an experiment
of nature.

1288
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:25,120
It's just an experiment of
horrible human behavior.

1289
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,385
And the most famous one in
language development, which

1290
00:51:27,385 --> 00:51:28,660
had a huge impact on
the field at the

1291
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:30,600
time, is a child, Genie.

1292
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,660
I'll show you.

1293
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:33,090
You'll see her in a movie
clip in a moment.

1294
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:37,800
They discovered her locked in
a room, in a house, from age

1295
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,510
20 months, approximately,
until they

1296
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:42,506
discovered her at 13.

1297
00:51:42,506 --> 00:51:44,640
She almost spoke to no one.

1298
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,160
So the people taking care of
her locked her in a closet,

1299
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,832
basically, and did not talk
with her, or she had no

1300
00:51:49,832 --> 00:51:51,550
language interactions
until she was

1301
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:52,945
discovered and rescued.

1302
00:51:52,945 --> 00:51:55,865
And then they performed research
for years saying

1303
00:51:55,865 --> 00:51:58,280
could she learn things, what
could she not learn.

1304
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,030
She got single words, for
example, but she never got

1305
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:02,190
particularly good at grammar.

1306
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:02,740
[INAUDIBLE]

1307
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:03,490
syntax.

1308
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:07,630
So a brutal way to test the idea
that what's acquirable

1309
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:08,780
later in life.

1310
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:11,330
And what, if you don't learn
it early in life, is

1311
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:13,170
impossible to acquire fully?

1312
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:13,980
So I'll end with this.

1313
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:15,790
We'll do this for five minutes
or seven minutes.

1314
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:18,810

1315
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:20,070
I'll stop there.

1316
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:22,980
It's summarized in your book.

1317
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:25,720
Everybody knows about it because
it's this study you

1318
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,535
couldn't do ethically
in a million years.

1319
00:52:28,535 --> 00:52:30,840
You would never do, which is if
you deprive a child of the

1320
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,780
critical period of language
exposure.

1321
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:35,220
And she never got lots of
aspects of language going.

1322
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:38,070
She got OK on a minimal
vocabulary,

1323
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:38,910
grew in other ways.

1324
00:52:38,910 --> 00:52:41,235
But many of the things that,
from a language perspective,

1325
00:52:41,235 --> 00:52:44,390
she never got because she missed
that critical period.

1326
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:47,000
So that's a bit of a sad story,
obviously, but have a

1327
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,815
good spring break and a
refreshing spring break.

1328
00:52:48,815 --> 00:52:50,065
And I'll see you in 10 days.

1329
00:52:50,065 --> 00:53:16,308
