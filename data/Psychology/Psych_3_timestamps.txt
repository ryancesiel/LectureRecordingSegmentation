00:00:28,299 --> 00:00:32,280
PROFESSOR JOHN GABRIELI: Last
time we discussed how people

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,720
can approach psychological
issues in terms of

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,650
experiments, and at least
correlations in some cases or

13
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,600
causal studies through
experiments.

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,400
And we discovered that
if you think

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,640
about money, what happens?

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,463
On average, you become more
self-reliant or less willing

17
00:00:51,463 --> 00:00:52,760
to help, right?

18
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,810
We discovered that if you just
change the way that men and

19
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:00,440
women approach each other at a
dating event, you change their

20
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,670
internal feelings and their
external behaviors simply by

21
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,660
who's approaching whom.

22
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,330
So we learned all kinds of
things that you might or might

23
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,304
not have known unless you
did the experiments.

24
00:01:12,304 --> 00:01:15,502
And for all these things that
are our mental life-- our

25
00:01:15,502 --> 00:01:16,896
thoughts, our feelings,
they are all

26
00:01:16,896 --> 00:01:18,920
supported by our brains.

27
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,054
And so for me personally as a
neuroscientist, I've always

28
00:01:21,054 --> 00:01:24,006
thought that the brain is one
of the three amazing things

29
00:01:24,006 --> 00:01:25,482
out there in the
natural world.

30
00:01:25,482 --> 00:01:29,750
With the origins of the
universe, the origin of life.

31
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,704
And the brain that allow us to
think and feel, to see, that

32
00:01:32,704 --> 00:01:39,190
remember, really everything that
we do comes from that.

33
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:39,860
OK.

34
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,540
So here's this device.

35
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,970
And I want to share with you
just this phrase that people

36
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,420
sometimes use, which is
that your mind is

37
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,890
what your brain does.

38
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,140
That your mind is what your
brain does And so the readings

39
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:59,500
from Oliver Sacks for today kind
of remind you of that.

40
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,910
So there are two women who have

41
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,820
seizures of various kinds.

42
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,970
And what happens in them?

43
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,160
So one is Mrs. OC, 88-year-old
woman.

44
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,190
And what starts to
happen to her?

45
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,940
She starts to hear songs.

46
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,910
And so powerfully, not just when
you have a little song in

47
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,140
your head, that it's hard for
her to hear conversations.

48
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,652
For her, a conversation like
we're having now, it's as if

49
00:02:25,652 --> 00:02:28,090
the music stayed
on really loud.

50
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,220
Turns out she's having temporal
lobe seizures.

51
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,420
The temporal lobes are the parts
of the brain that are

52
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,340
terribly important
for hearing.

53
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,970
So music is something
that we hear.

54
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,390
And then she has a right
temporal lobe infarction.

55
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,350
She's had an injury in the
right temporal lobe.

56
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,250
Music, for most of us, is more
dependent on right hemisphere

57
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,230
processes than the left.

58
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,800
So that makes it unusual.

59
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,280
And how does she feel about
the whole process?

60
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,980
So what's generating
the songs, though?

61
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,890
What's generating the songs
that she hears?

62
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,630
Yeah, her memory.

63
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,910
Her brain, right?

64
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,300
Because in epilepsy,
what's happening?

65
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,930
Neurons are firing.

66
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,970
When neurons fire in organized
patterns, those are memories,

67
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,560
desires, physical actions,
thoughts.

68
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,760
When they're firing for no good
reason like an epilepsy

69
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,110
because of some brain
difficulty,

70
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,090
they just start firing.

71
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,710
But the neurons that happen to
be firing will drive certain

72
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,620
mental processes that they
normally support.

73
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,710
In this case, the neurons that
are firing away are ones that

74
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,560
are involved in memory
or songs and

75
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,280
perception for songs.

76
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,810
And when they fire, it's as if
you heard the song itself.

77
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,350
Because when you hear my voice
or when you hear a song,

78
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,600
you're never hearing the song.

79
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,730
You're always hearing what your
neurons are interpreting

80
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,520
the sound that comes
to your ear.

81
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,980
Your mind is what your brain
does in that sense, and in a

82
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,670
very central way.

83
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,680
If you had an injury in that
part of the brain, you can be

84
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,460
cortically deaf and never hear
a sound, even though all the

85
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,260
information came through
your ear.

86
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,390
So without your brain
interpreting the environment,

87
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,340
you wouldn't know what it is.

88
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,820
But if your brain starts to fire
on its own, that's just

89
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,870
as good a signal as if you
heard a song itself.

90
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,550
Because that is the stuff
of hearing songs.

91
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,080
So she enjoyed it, actually.

92
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,000
She declined taking
anti-convulsive medications.

93
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,459
Because she felt it was a portal
to her past, right?

94
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,820
The songs that she heard were
ones that reminded her of her

95
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,590
life and were kind of
pleasant to hear.

96
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,490
It was like being on a nonstop
highlight film of for life, or

97
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:31,280
a highlight MP3.

98
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,900
So now an opposite response to
a similar phenomenon comes

99
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,270
from a Mrs. OM in her 80s.

100
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,620
She hears songs, but she
also hears a lot

101
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,030
of ringing and hissing.

102
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,330
It's not limited to
the song itself.

103
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,720
She doesn't mention any
of this for how long?

104
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,240
Four years.

105
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,380
She's hearing ringing,
hissing, songs.

106
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,350
She knows because her mind is
fine that they're coming from

107
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,150
nowhere but inside her head.

108
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,330
But she doesn't tell anybody.

109
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,390
That's a huge burden, right?

110
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:02,614
And why doesn't she tell them?

111
00:05:02,614 --> 00:05:03,600
Yeah, yeah.

112
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,850
And especially if you're in
your 80s, and you're going

113
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:08,220
around saying, I'm hearing
things, people go, OK.

114
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,090
Were putting you in the
old age home, right?

115
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,430
You're out of it.

116
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,860
So she doesn't want to
give up her freedom.

117
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,780
And she gets a short playlist,
just three songs, and hears

118
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,620
them over and over
and over again.

119
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,050
You may have had the experience
that some songs you

120
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:25,500
hear for a while.

121
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,670
You like them more, and then
you get tired of them.

122
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,730
If you had only three all the
time, every day, and a bad

123
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,760
version that was hissing and
ringing, you would get pretty

124
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,440
tired of the songs too.

125
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,640
That stops by anti-convulsive
medications and medications

126
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,640
that stops the seizures,
stop the songs.

127
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,420
And so it's sort of a beautiful
story, when two

128
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:49,090
opposite emotional responses for
how your mind is what your

129
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,470
brain does.

130
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,700
Now from this, the fact that
songs are played back as if

131
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,270
you had pulled out songs from
your computer or shelf

132
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,860
somewhere, you might think that
the brain retains these

133
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,410
records perfectly throughout
life and epilepsy

134
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,160
would just sort them.

135
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,430
But we'll come back to that
later on, and say that in very

136
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,360
much, we don't think
memory is that way.

137
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,390
But we do remember songs that
are important for us.

138
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,780
And if our brain just starts
firing in the same place where

139
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:17,720
we store those songs, we hear
them just as real as your

140
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,970
cortex hears it when it hears
the actual song itself.

141
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,000
Because that's the place
where you hear it.

142
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,950
So this is the kind of evidence
that at least in some

143
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,940
sense, your mind is what
your brain does.

144
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,340
And so here's this
amazing brain.

145
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,320
It's about two to
three pounds.

146
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,300
But every thought and feeling
you'll ever have, or every

147
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,130
physical movement, every desire,
every thing that

148
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,710
you're proud of or ashamed of
that crosses your mind will be

149
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,020
supported by this structure.

150
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,350
So I'm going to talk a little
bit about the neurons, just a

151
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,700
little bit about the neurons
that compose the brain, and a

152
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:51,050
little bit about a quick tour
through the gross organization

153
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:51,470
of the brain.

154
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,020
We'll come back to many of these
structures as they're

155
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,430
relevant to different things
like memory or emotion or

156
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,390
personality later
in the course.

157
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,760
Talk a little bit about the
enterprise of trying to say

158
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,660
which parts of our brain
support which

159
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,910
parts of our mind.

160
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,540
Missteps about that, famous
cases about that, that have

161
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:13,010
turned out to have roughly
the right message.

162
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,380
And we'll focus on hemispheric
specialization, the thing in

163
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,840
humans where our left hemisphere
and our right

164
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,340
hemisphere are organized to
accomplish different things,

165
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,380
to support different
mental functions.

166
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,510
And the surprise from split
brain or commissurotomy

167
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:31,790
patients, that these different
mental lives that support our

168
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,930
different parts of
the brain, that

169
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,290
they can live in isolation.

170
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,880
They don't even know they're
there one to the other.

171
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,380
So let me rephrase this.

172
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:44,500
As you sit there, the thought is
you might have independent

173
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,870
parts of your mind supported
by independent

174
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,420
part of your brain.

175
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,870
And at any one moment, your
consciousness might be in one

176
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,550
part, and then it might
move to another.

177
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,810
And just like there's all these
people in this room,

178
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,410
your brain might be all these
things having their own

179
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:02,100
independent thinking lives.

180
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,560
They have to interact a lot.

181
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,490
But how much might there be
independent modules in your

182
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:09,010
brain that are doing
their own thing.

183
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:11,940
And now you're thinking about
music, and those turn on, and

184
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,440
that's where your consciousness
is.

185
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,830
Now you're thinking
about history.

186
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,070
Now you're thinking about
dinner tonight.

187
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,190
And different parts of your
brain turn on and that's when

188
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,540
your consciousness is moving
from one part of your

189
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,580
brain to the other.

190
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,150
But the other parts
keep going.

191
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,630
So we'll see how plausible
is that.

192
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,180
So it took a long time for
people to decide that the

193
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,510
brain actually is the
stuff of the mind.

194
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:40,220
Smart philosophers like Plato
said, well, it's part of the

195
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,860
body that's closest
to the heavens.

196
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,300
That's where the gods might
reside, so that's a good place

197
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,210
to have your mind and that's
where your brain is.

198
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:50,310
A sort of GPS approach
to locating where

199
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,540
the mind might be.

200
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,040
Aristotle said, wait a minute.

201
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,090
It's the warm and active heart--
the heart was very

202
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,280
impressive in post-mortem
examination of people who have

203
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,210
passed away--

204
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,040
that houses the mind.

205
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,520
And that it cools, and there's
an inner brain.

206
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,860
So the brain was kind of a
radiator that would sort of

207
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,630
cool stuff off to keep
the heart in optimal.

208
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,110
And even now, we talk
about people having

209
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,580
a big heart, right?

210
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,250
A cold heart, a warm heart.

211
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,950
We still talk about human
personality or character in

212
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,700
terms of heart.

213
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,230
Galen said that the brain
was surrounded-- there's

214
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,070
ventricles in the middle of
the brain that have fluid,

215
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,400
cerebral spinal fluid.

216
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,000
And he hypothesized that the
brain was the packing material

217
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,580
that protects that fluid.

218
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,560
Hang on to that fluid, that's
all your stuff.

219
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,410
We're going to cram a lot of
stuff around it, right?

220
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,890
Like the bubble pack that
comes in the boxes.

221
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,720
And of course now we know it's
the opposite way around.

222
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,370
The mind is in the physical,
the dense part of

223
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,420
the brain, not that.

224
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,270
And then ideas from Descartes,
the pineal body is one of the

225
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:46,660
very few structures that's in
the midline of the brain, that

226
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,210
doesn't have a thing on the left
and a thing on the right.

227
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:52,560
And so he thought maybe that's
where things get unified in

228
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,180
the whole brain.

229
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,290
It all comes together
as the place that

230
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,390
runs the whole brain.

231
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,290
And that's a wrong idea.

232
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:00,530
But people were trying to figure
out what was going on.

233
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,670
In modern neuroscience,
there's many levels of

234
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,300
analysis of the brain.

235
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,480
So if you go to any neuroscience
program, like

236
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,880
Department of Brain and
Cognitive Science, you will

237
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,440
actually see scientists who
study things like molecules

238
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,830
and synapses, molecular
neurobiology, how neurons

239
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:18,870
work, how neurons form networks,
little organizations

240
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,270
of things that solve problems
at a higher level, maps,

241
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,330
systems in the brain
as a whole.

242
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,060
In this course, we mostly have
to operate at this level.

243
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,590
That's the place where it's easy
for us to relate in some

244
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,700
ways parts of the mind as we
understand it, of human nature

245
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,720
as we understand it, and
physical parts of the brain.

246
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,400
It's very hard for
us to get that to

247
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,920
molecules at the moment.

248
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,910
But lots of neuroscience is
working to connect these

249
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,940
things at different levels.

250
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,970
And I can't resist talking for
one second, too, about the

251
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,730
fact that we know our
brains were not

252
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,760
designed from scratch.

253
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,680
You are not humans 3.0
or 98.0, right?

254
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,180
Everything in us in some way
evolved from other species

255
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,270
that were similar to us,
and far enough back,

256
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,440
dissimilar to us.

257
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,450
So there's lots of speculation
about how it is that we

258
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,360
balance parts of the brain
that are ancient in their

259
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,540
evolutionary roots, that are
more recent in their

260
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,830
evolutionary basis, and what
that means about us.

261
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:13,520
Another sense in which we're
comprised of multiple society

262
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,940
of brain systems in
between our ears.

263
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,110
So we know the cells in the
brain are glia support cells

264
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,760
and neurons, that a neuron--

265
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,900
and I know you all
know all this.

266
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,990
Oh, let me say a word
about notes.

267
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:30,610
So we sent PDFs of the lecture
notes from the first two

268
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,370
lectures and the third
one just recently.

269
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,930
Starting tomorrow, we'll send
you the PDF of each lecture,

270
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,890
the latest by the night
before the lecture.

271
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,820
So you will be able to
print it out or look

272
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,230
at it on the computer.

273
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,990
But neurons have a soma
or cell body.

274
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,930
Those make up the grey matter
when we look at the brain.

275
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,570
They have an axon that can be
covered with myelin that makes

276
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,330
the white matter.

277
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:55,540
The dendrite is the extensions
of the neurons that have the

278
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,700
input to the neuron.

279
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,300
We know that neurons
communicate by

280
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:03,660
neurotransmitters across
synapses, junctions between

281
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,140
different parts of neurons.

282
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,610
When you have a collection
of cell bodies,

283
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,110
people call it a nucleus.

284
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,490
When you have a collection of
axons, they call it a tract.

285
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,860
It's just vocabulary
and stuff.

286
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,360
And you know this from other
courses, just reminding you

287
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,190
about them.

288
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:18,650
And then you get these
unbelievably startling kinds

289
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,090
of numbers, which are always
huge estimates.

290
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:25,180
But they show you how amazing
your brain is, and how hard it

291
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:30,560
is for us to deeply understand
how the brain works.

292
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,150
I mean, we understand incredibly
more than we did 10

293
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,440
years ago, 20 years
ago, 30 years ago.

294
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,950
We're incredibly far from
understanding how your brain

295
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,950
accomplishes the amazing
things it accomplishes.

296
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,360
So it has about 100
billion neurons.

297
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,810
It has about 100 trillion
synapses, connections among

298
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,500
neurons and dendrites.

299
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,410
If you were to lay out the very
thin myelinated axons in

300
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:55,870
your brain, just the big axons
that get myelin, it's

301
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:00,090
estimated that you'd have
62,000 miles of axons.

302
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,020
That's pretty good, right?

303
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,270
Now you really want to wear
helmets when you go

304
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,740
skateboarding or anything,
right?

305
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,370
And about 100,000 miles of
dendrites in each of you.

306
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,650
So this is why the brain
is amazing and hard.

307
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:15,080
It's fantastic in
its complexity.

308
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,200
An average neuron may have up
to 15,000 connections, 1,000

309
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,430
synapses, and up to
1,000 neurons.

310
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,680
There's different ways
of thinking about the

311
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,160
computational power
of a neuron.

312
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,780
But they estimate that these
might have, each one the

313
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,200
computational power of
something like a

314
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,310
medium-sized computer.

315
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:38,460
So it's not the best computer,
but you've got

316
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,760
100 billion of them.

317
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,780
Now, that's the easy part.

318
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,190
Take 100 billion neurons and
your computer's in your head.

319
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,040
The hard part is to get them
all working together

320
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,660
efficiently.

321
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,030
And you're not sitting around
going, "Computer 33, get up to

322
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,720
speed here.

323
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,620
Something's wrong here." You
don't even think about them.

324
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,110
You just go about
your business.

325
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,400
The time for information to go
from neuron to neuron is

326
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,250
pretty slow compared to fast
computers, pretty fast for

327
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,800
biology, 10 milliseconds.

328
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,100
And everybody thinks the secret
of the brain, whatever

329
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,960
it will turn out to be in many
ways, is that you can run a

330
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,330
fantastic number of computations
simultaneously

331
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,930
and collaboratively.

332
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,640
But we don't have a deep
understanding of how

333
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,715
that all plays out.

334
00:14:15,715 --> 00:14:20,000
So here's a cartoon of this
amazing axon, the cell body,

335
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,600
and the dendrites to
get inputs to it.

336
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,865
The axon is the output signal
of a typical neuron.

337
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:27,770
Neurons can have these beautiful
arborizations,

338
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:30,500
tree-like properties
of dendrites.

339
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,850
Neurons have all kinds of
different shapes in different

340
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:35,070
parts of the brain, presumably
reflecting their different

341
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:38,416
missions, what they have
to accomplish.

342
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:42,400
An incredibly complicated
cellular factory inside all of

343
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,980
them is producing different
things.

344
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,600
This is a big overview.

345
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,850
This is not for you to learn
a specific fact.

346
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,000
And this, here's an actual
neuron that's injected in the

347
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,780
fantastic tree of connections it
makes within the neurons to

348
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,930
accomplish its mission.

349
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,670
Here's a cartoon of a synapse,
places where neurotransmitters

350
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:03,750
signal from one axon to one
dendrite, for example.

351
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,370
Here's an actual picture.

352
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:09,010
Here's the package of vesicles
that house the

353
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:11,230
neurotransmitters in them,
making a connection or a

354
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,390
synapse onto a dendrite.

355
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,420
And you just have a fantastic
number of these.

356
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,140
And as you're sitting in you
right now an unbelievable

357
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,090
amount of stuff is going on--
releasing them, cleaning them

358
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,720
away so they don't hang around
too long, building new ones to

359
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,640
get ready to go.

360
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,780
It's just an unbelievable story
per neuron, never mind

361
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,050
the whole of them.

362
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,430
So now we take a step back
to the brain as a whole.

363
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,050
Here's the front of the
brain, top of the

364
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,210
brain, back of the brain.

365
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,210
I'm going to say a word about
the cerebellum, which we'll

366
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,840
talk very little about
in this course.

367
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,120
The cellular organization
of the cerebellum is so

368
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,190
consistent that people estimate
that half of all the

369
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:47,460
cortical neurons in the brain
are in the cerebellum.

370
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,480
And if you see this cerebellar
size is small, not that large,

371
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,990
it's because it's packed
so tightly.

372
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,250
And it's so consistent in its
organization that people

373
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,830
thought, that's the first part
of the brain we'll crack.

374
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:01,110
Because the organization is so
clear that we'll be able to

375
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,060
figure out what it's computing
and how it does it.

376
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,450
And it's turned out to be
about as mysterious a

377
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,030
structure as any.

378
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,730
I can't tell you the number of
debates about what people-- we

379
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,140
know it's involved in motor
control, but in many other

380
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,760
things, as well.

381
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,080
The wiring diagram, knowing it,
what's connected to who,

382
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,270
turns out to be only a tiny step
in understanding how what

383
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,610
part of the brain does
what it does.

384
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:24,800
So here's this mysterious
cerebellum.

385
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,550
And then here's a basal ganglia
that we know is

386
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,280
involved in movement.

387
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,620
Parkinson's Disease
affects it.

388
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,530
Huntington's Disease
affects it.

389
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:37,410
It's also involved in learning
habits of all kinds.

390
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:40,240
It's also involved in the reward
systems of the brain.

391
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,420
What have we found delightful
and important?

392
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,290
What did we want to do
because the reward

393
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:47,240
system is turned on?

394
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,110
We'll come back to
that later on.

395
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,210
And then the limbic system, the
part of the brain that's

396
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,060
involved in emotion
and memory--

397
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,200
amygdala and hippocampus.

398
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,950
We'll come back to that.

399
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,440
If you don't have this structure
intact, you can't

400
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,340
form new memories ever again.

401
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:04,190
We'll talk about patients
like that.

402
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,010
And then we'll come to the
smarts of the brain, the

403
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,520
cerebral cortex, four lobes--

404
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,839
frontal, parietal, occipital,
and temporal.

405
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,550
You have four on the left
and four on the right.

406
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,540
These lobes are comprised
of gyri.

407
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,369
That's the part of the brain
that sticks out.

408
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:22,640
And then there's this sort of
indentation where it dives

409
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,000
deep into a sulcus.

410
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,510
Comes back up, it's the next
gyrus, dives deep into the

411
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,540
next sulcus.

412
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,620
A huge sulcus is called
a fissure.

413
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:34,020
Here's a Sylvian fissure that
separates the temporal and

414
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,600
frontal cortices.

415
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,900
And one of the reasons that
people have speculated about

416
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,640
why do we have a thing
like that?

417
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,380
Why do we have these waves of
a gyrus going up and then

418
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,230
plunging into the depths, then
coming back up like this again

419
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:52,040
and plunging from sulcus
to sulcus?

420
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,840
And nobody really knows.

421
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,330
But there's kind of
a speculation

422
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:58,510
that's fun and plausible.

423
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:03,160
One thing we know is that bigger
cortices are good, not

424
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,050
so much one person to another,
but across species.

425
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,820
Your smarts are in
your cortices--

426
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,090
language, higher-level
thought, and so on.

427
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,980
So on the whole, a species that
has bigger cortices has a

428
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,670
lot of opportunities for
thought and social

429
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,840
development and so on.

430
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:21,380
So you could imagine having
babies with heads this big.

431
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,850
They'd be really smart, maybe.

432
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,555
But what would be the problem?

433
00:18:26,555 --> 00:18:30,710

434
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,830
What would be the big problem?

435
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:37,240
Think about it not from your
perspective, perhaps, if most

436
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,740
of you are sort of teenagers or
young 20s or something like

437
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,220
that, most of you.

438
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:46,900
So you don't remember your birth
experience directly.

439
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,730
But who remembers your birth
experience pretty well?

440
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:50,320
Your parents?

441
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:50,820
OK.

442
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,060
All right.

443
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,770
It's your mother, especially.

444
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,540
Giving birth is a
pretty painful,

445
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,730
specific, challenging process.

446
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,340
So if a head this big came
out, it would be

447
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,725
incommensurate with the
birth canal that

448
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:02,530
the mother can afford.

449
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,020
It's already pretty challenging
with your head as

450
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,550
big as it is when
it comes out.

451
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,450
That's the challenge of birth.

452
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,890
It's not getting the
arms and legs out.

453
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:11,150
Its the head that's too big.

454
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,060
So now we have a problem that
the mother's birth canal is

455
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:14,790
only so big.

456
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,755
We want as much brain and
smartness in our species and

457
00:19:17,755 --> 00:19:19,050
in ourselves as possible.

458
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,850
So how are we going to get a
lot of neocortex in there?

459
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:23,370

460
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,890
We're going to fold it.

461
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:30,720
A lot of neocortex in there,
but a smaller volume to get

462
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,070
out through the birth canal.

463
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,170
And that's thought to be why the
brain has this elaborate

464
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:39,180
plunging from sulcus to sulcus,
and this sort of

465
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:43,620
convolved physical structure.

466
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,070
And if we think about the brain,
we can think about

467
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,770
things that go into our brains,
about the outer world.

468
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:54,220
So when you see, vision enters
through this area, or when you

469
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,800
hear, it enters here.

470
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,640
When you touch or when you move
your body, these are the

471
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,680
motor cortical neurons.

472
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,250
So it's either sort of major
inputs or major output.

473
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:02,840
That's in blue.

474
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,900
That's the areas that are
devoted to specific perception

475
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,320
or modalities or sensories.

476
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,905
And then we have areas
in yellow here.

477
00:20:09,905 --> 00:20:11,470
They are the areas
that are sort of

478
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,760
closely tied to one modality.

479
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,690
But already, they're
interpreting what's going on.

480
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,290
And then you have areas in pink
here that are sort of not

481
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:23,070
tied to any modality and are
devoted to what we might call

482
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,100
abstract thought.

483
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,950
And you can see the prefrontal
cortex, the part of the cortex

484
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,930
that's in front of
the motor cortex.

485
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,510
There's a huge swath
like that.

486
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,370
We'll come back to that.

487
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,180
We think it's terribly important
for thinking,

488
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,680
problem solving, and
many aspects of the

489
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,570
highest human mentation.

490
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:43,090
Now we're a huge believer in
the end that form follows

491
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,430
function in the brain.

492
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,250
And if we understood the correct
relationship between

493
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,240
form and function,
we'd be very far.

494
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,170
And a neuroanatomist named
[? Broadbent ?]

495
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:53,340
made the following
heroic effort.

496
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,830
What he did is he sectioned
brains into

497
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,370
lots of thin slices.

498
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,570
And he followed them through
a microscope.

499
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:02,170
And every time the brain tissue
changed, the neurons

500
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:06,220
looked different, he would
change the number of the area.

501
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,880
So he started in something
like Area One.

502
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,230
And the neurons look
pretty similar.

503
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,570
And he's moving,
moving, moving.

504
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,450
And then all of a sudden
they start to look

505
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:13,720
different, the neurons.

506
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,540
And then that becomes something
like Area Three.

507
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,920
Moving, moving, Area Four.

508
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,095
Moving, moving, Area Six.

509
00:21:19,095 --> 00:21:23,410
So every time the neurons looked
different to his eye,

510
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,530
it gets a new number.

511
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:27,105
The idea being when the neurons
look different, they

512
00:21:27,105 --> 00:21:28,380
have a different job to do.

513
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,490
And that part of the brain
does something different.

514
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,020
And there's lots of debates
about the best way to do this,

515
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,090
or different interpretations.

516
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,560
But something like this holds
true in a striking way.

517
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,210
The cellular organization of the
brain reflects in some way

518
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,180
what that part of the brain is
accomplishing, what part of

519
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,150
your mind it supports.

520
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:47,040
And then we have simplified
color pictures of this.

521
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,520
And we'll come back to
neuroimaging next time.

522
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,880
But it's turned out to have a
second life in neuroimaging.

523
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,940
Because when scientists across
the world want to compare

524
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,620
their neuroimaging results,
they'll talk about, well, I

525
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:03,610
got activation in Area 46,
or I got it in Area 21.

526
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:06,520
It's become a nomenclature for
the organization of the human

527
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,480
brain that allows you to
integrate all kinds of imaging

528
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,100
data about the human species.

529
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,310
And here's a view from the
inside of the brain.

530
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,420
And here's a structure chord,
the corpus callosum, that

531
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:20,500
we'll come back to in the
next few minutes.

532
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:25,790
So how much are functions
localized or distributed?

533
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,700
How much is--

534
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,970
you have a specific thing your
mind does, and it's in one

535
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:31,600
place in the brain versus it's
spread over a range.

536
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,110
And this idea of how much things
are distributed or

537
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,560
localized for mental functions
in the brain has been a source

538
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,900
of huge debate.

539
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,130
And I'll show you a misstep,
and then I'll show you some

540
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:43,510
things where we think we
have it more correctly.

541
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,280
The misstep is a phrenology.

542
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,240
And the most famous name
in this is from Gall.

543
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,700
Spurzheim is another one.

544
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,950
And in the 19th century--
that's the 1800s--

545
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,800
the phrenology took
hold a lot.

546
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,340
And there's a sort of
a Freudian story.

547
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,650
If you want to call it that,
of Gall, which is that

548
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:05,090
apparently when he was a
student, he viewed himself as

549
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:07,750
a very effortful and fastidious
student who took

550
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,800
all the notes you're supposed to
take, and worked very hard

551
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,580
for exams and did everything
you were supposed to do.

552
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,520
But shock of shocks,
some students did

553
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,470
better than he did.

554
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,690
And he looked around
the classroom.

555
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:18,940
He said, who are these
students doing

556
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,700
better than I am?

557
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,050
Because I'm trying
as hard as I can.

558
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,180
And some students are
doing better.

559
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,360
And he said, hey, one thing I
notice about these students is

560
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,320
they all seem to have
big foreheads.

561
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:26,766
OK?

562
00:23:26,766 --> 00:23:27,212
[CHUCKLES]

563
00:23:27,212 --> 00:23:30,030
Now, I don't know how accurate
he was scientifically.

564
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:32,920
But apparently, this was a
emotionally transformative

565
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,670
moment for Gall.

566
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:34,900
And you'll see in what
way this ended

567
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,990
up guiding his science.

568
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:41,560
So Gall and Spurzheim were
actually good neuroanatomists.

569
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,680
They describe lots of things
about the brain that were

570
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,290
correct that were kind of
unknown at the time.

571
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:49,440
For example, the pyramidal
tracts, the tracts that move

572
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,780
from your motor cortex-- say on
your left to control your

573
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,970
right hand, or on your right
to control your left hand--

574
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:58,110
they describe those very well.

575
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,400
But here's where they
got kind of funny.

576
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,080
They said, OK, we can describe
the physical

577
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,090
organization of the brain.

578
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,760
But now let's say which
part of the brain is

579
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,990
which part of the mind.

580
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:08,140
And in a way that we now
consider a bit willy-nilly,

581
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,940
they began to assign different
mental processes to different

582
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,660
parts of the brain.

583
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,330
And the way they did it was they
said, I'm going to look

584
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:14,820
at somebody.

585
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,540
And let's pretend somebody you
know is very combative.

586
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,830
What they began to
figure was this.

587
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,190
Well, maybe the part of the
brain that's involved in being

588
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,250
combative--

589
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,710
the more combative you are,
the more you have of it.

590
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:30,840
So if I feel your skull above
the part of the brain that I

591
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,070
think goes with being combative,
if you have a big

592
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,400
rise there, if I feel your
head-- and most of our heads

593
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,410
are a little bumpy--

594
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,830
the person who's really
combative is going to have a

595
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:43,170
lot of bump there.

596
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:45,960
And the person who's very
meek will have none.

597
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,030
OK, does that make sense?

598
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,470
They have these little
categories as they just

599
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:49,630
thought about people.

600
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:56,180
And they developed this idea
that they could find where

601
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:59,790
cautiousness was, or
precociousness, or

602
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,850
secretiveness.

603
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,260
You'd give it a big
bump there.

604
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,140
Let me show you this picture.

605
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:06,440
Here's a device you would step
into that would have springs

606
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,280
go down, and then it would go
up, and they would say, where

607
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,170
do you have the high bumps?

608
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,640
And where do you have
the little bumps?

609
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,770
Now all of this is wrong.

610
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:18,610
Because it's a naive way and not
a scientific way to do it.

611
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:21,460
Weirdly enough, look at what
they put below the eye--

612
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,260
language.

613
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,930
Now that's a weird
place to put it.

614
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:27,310
And what they saw was a soldier
who had a wound that

615
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:30,250
went his eye and
into his brain.

616
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,930
And they said, OK, he had
trouble producing language.

617
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:34,860
And they said, well, that's
where language is.

618
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,900
Language is not below
your eye.

619
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:41,200
But they didn't realize that the
wound went up into what's

620
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,080
something called Broca's area.

621
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,870
We'll talk about that
in a couple minutes.

622
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:46,580
And so they weren't
that wrong.

623
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,540
They just didn't think
through where the end

624
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,800
of the injury was.

625
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,760
All the other ones, we
completely dismiss these days.

626
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,380
But we have to worry about naive
ways in which we link

627
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,770
the life of the mind to the
stuff of the brain.

628
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:00,950
And they did a control
experiment. "The famous

629
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:03,540
physiologist, Magendie,
preserved with veneration the

630
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,945
brain of Laplace," who's
a big name in

631
00:26:04,945 --> 00:26:06,340
the history of chemistry.

632
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,290
"Spurzheim had the natural
wish to see the brain."

633
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,640
Spurzheim was the
phrenologist.

634
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,330
"To test the science of
phrenologist, Magendie showed

635
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:14,400
him instead the brain
of an imbecile.

636
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,670
Spurzheim, who had already
worked up his enthusiasm,

637
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:19,400
admired the brain of the
imbecile as he would have

638
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,290
admired that of Laplace."

639
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,350
So this was a control assess.

640
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,030
I give you a brain of somebody
who's not a genius in

641
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,510
chemistry, and you
go, oh my gosh.

642
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:27,750
This chemistry part of the
brain is unbelievable.

643
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:31,230
And this is the old idea we
talked about, that if you have

644
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:34,220
an idea you believe in as a
scientist, you will always

645
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:38,420
find positive evidence for
it everywhere you look.

646
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,580
Back to the brain, and let's
talk about this part, the

647
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,610
lower part of the orbital
frontal cortex.

648
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,720
It sits right above your eyes.

649
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,080
Your eyes would be something
like here.

650
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,710
And we know something about what
that part of the brain

651
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:54,070
does from the famous case
of Phineas Gage.

652
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,920
He was involved in railroad
construction in Vermont.

653
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,980
And that involved exploding
rocks to level the area so

654
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,260
they could put in
train tracks.

655
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,880
They would drill a
hole, put in some

656
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,850
fuse, put in the powder.

657
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:07,290
And they would use a tamping
iron to push down the sand and

658
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:10,670
powder so there would be a big
explosion to flatten the rock.

659
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:14,760
And at age 25 in 1848, he has
a mind who was described as

660
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,640
well-balanced, energetic,
and persistent.

661
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,970
He was the ideal employee,
resourceful, hardworking.

662
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,880
He was made a foreman,
a leader.

663
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,610
He was the most efficient and
capable in the group.

664
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:28,970
And on September 13, 1848,
something big happened.

665
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,420
There was a miscommunication.

666
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,990
An iron that was three feet,
seven inches in length--

667
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:35,130
I'll show you a picture in a
moment, because even if you've

668
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,190
heard this story, until you see
a picture of it, you can't

669
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:40,870
grasp how big this was compared
to a human being.

670
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:43,310
There was a miscommunication,
the explosion went off early.

671
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,710
He was directly over it.

672
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:47,670
The rod flew up, went through
his head, all the

673
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:48,740
way through his head.

674
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:53,340
And it had the power to land 30
yards away after exploding

675
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,860
up into the air.

676
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:59,040
And by March of the next year,
he was back at work.

677
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,200
Not too long a vacation, a
recovery period for that big a

678
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,190
thing going through your head.

679
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:06,250
But his personality had
fundamentally changed.

680
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:11,130
So here's his cast of his actual
head and his skull.

681
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:13,220
Here's where it shot
up through here

682
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,660
and out this hole.

683
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,630
Here's the actual rod
compared to that.

684
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:21,330
So if you haven't seen this,
you can underestimate the

685
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,050
amazingness of this thing.

686
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:27,370
And at the time he was famous
not for the reason we now

687
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:28,180
think of him.

688
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:31,930
He was just a Ripley's believe
it or not story of that a

689
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:34,750
human survived at all.

690
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:38,120
So Antonio Damasio has attempted
to reconstruct by

691
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:42,540
computer where this rod shot up
through here and out into

692
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,250
30 yards away.

693
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,770
They're that big compared
to him.

694
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,970
And the amazing thing, and
described by a physician who

695
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,580
worked with him at the time,
is "the equilibrium to his

696
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:54,130
intellectual faculties and
animal propensities seems to

697
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:54,630
have destroyed.

698
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:57,085
He is fitful, irreverent,
indulging at times in the

699
00:28:57,085 --> 00:28:58,510
grossest profanity.

700
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,360
Little deference for his
fellows, impatient of

701
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,610
restraint, conflicting
with his desires.

702
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:05,130
At times pertinaciously
obstinate, capricious and

703
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:08,150
vacillating, devising many plans
of future operations,

704
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,450
which are no sooner arranged
than they are abandoned in

705
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,310
turn for others appearing
more feasible."

706
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:14,500
Exactly the opposite of
who he was before.

707
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,900
He was a responsible,
efficient leader.

708
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,680
And now he's a totally
irresponsible person doing all

709
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,110
kinds of things that
make no sense.

710
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,710
"A child in his intellectual
capacity, he has the animal

711
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:27,030
passions of a strong man."
So he completely

712
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,090
changed who he was.

713
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:31,030
In this regard, his mind was so
radically changed that his

714
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:34,210
friends and acquaintances said
that "he was no longer Gage."

715
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:37,540
So here's a physical insult to
the brain that changes the

716
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,940
character of a person, that
changes what we would think of

717
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,520
as the moral judgments.

718
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,010
Of when is it right to tell the
truth, having plans and

719
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:47,980
being a responsible, trustworthy
person, completely

720
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,650
changed by this injury.

721
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:52,180

722
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,860
One interpretation is this part
of the brain is essential

723
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:59,210
for making moral judgments and
being of good character.

724
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:01,940
What would be another
interpretation of why he might

725
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:07,080
have changed, just common sense
besides that this part

726
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,300
of the brain does that?

727
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:11,620
We want to not be for
phrenologists, OK?

728
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:16,140
So the first thought is, this
part of the brain supports

729
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,400
what we think of as moral
reasoning and character.

730
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,040
Well, what else could you
imagine might have happened?

731
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,980

732
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,174
Yeah.

733
00:30:26,174 --> 00:30:29,443
AUDIENCE: He had a giant spike
driven though his skull and is

734
00:30:29,443 --> 00:30:30,377
upset about it?

735
00:30:30,377 --> 00:30:31,790
PROFESSOR JOHN GABRIELI: Yeah.

736
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:34,220
I'll make up something
like that.

737
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,070
But a more psychological and
different interpretation, let

738
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:39,120
me try this one.

739
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,120
He was getting ready
for the future.

740
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,270
I'll be a foreman today, and
then next week, I'll be

741
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,300
executive vice president, and
then I'll be associate

742
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,170
executive president.

743
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,610
And a rod goes through
his head, and he

744
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:49,170
goes, wait a minute.

745
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:49,810
Life is short.

746
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:51,250
It could end at any moment.

747
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,530
Why not just do what I want
to do all the time?

748
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:57,020
Because the next rod could
come who knows when.

749
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,110
And I had all these plans, and
I was promising people things

750
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,670
next week that I delivered on.

751
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:04,070
But that's a sucker's life,
because your life

752
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,080
can end like that.

753
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:09,710
So forget all the stuff about--
just enjoy the moment.

754
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,160
That's a possible thing, OK?

755
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,690
You see movies like that, where
people are told, you

756
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:15,300
have so long to live,
and they change.

757
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,800
What would you want to convince
yourself that it

758
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,850
wasn't something like that,
which is not an unreasonable

759
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,100
interpretation?

760
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,560

761
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:27,120
What you would want to see, at a
minimum, is that if you have

762
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,540
brain injuries other places in
the brain, you don't see that.

763
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,240
And if you have other people
with brain injuries in the

764
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,990
same part of the brain, you
see that consistently.

765
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,100
At a minimum, you want
to say it's not

766
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,130
just a big brain injury.

767
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:39,620
But it's consistently a brain
injury in this part of the

768
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,460
brain that leads to this
kind of behavior.

769
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,970
And for at least this example,
that's true.

770
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:46,490
Other patients with similar
injuries behaved similarly.

771
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:49,750
People with very big injuries
elsewhere in the brain don't

772
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,660
behave similarly.

773
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:54,060
So there's a lot of reason in
the end for us to believe that

774
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,640
this part of the brain is
essential for something that

775
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,790
we consider almost
metaphysical.

776
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:01,920
Character has this incredibly
physical dependence.

777
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,280
And relatively recently, just
a few years ago, they

778
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:09,700
discovered a picture of
Phineas Gage himself.

779
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,380
Here's the rod.

780
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,560
Here's the injury to his eye,
his eye is damaged.

781
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,330
So one more example, and then
we'll switch this refrain.

782
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:19,010
Paul Broca.

783
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:22,150
And Broca's area in the brain,
here's Paul Broca.

784
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,510
Here's a brain of a patient
named Mr. Tan.

785
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,280
And let me say a word
about the story.

786
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,230
So in France, a number of people
observing patients with

787
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:32,140
injuries had talked about that
the left side of the brain is

788
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,600
important for speech.

789
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,820
Until then there had not been
much ideas that the left and

790
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,270
right were fundamentally
different.

791
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,700
So there's always sort of a

792
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,390
background before the discovery.

793
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:44,350
And there's a talk in 1861 which
describes a man who lost

794
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,710
his speech but understood
everything said to him.

795
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:47,660
He couldn't produce speech.

796
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,955
He could understand speech.

797
00:32:48,955 --> 00:32:50,980
His intelligence is
still unimpaired.

798
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,390
His speech is gone.

799
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:55,610
And then Broca heard that talk,
and he went back, and

800
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:58,360
five days later a patient named
LeBorgne, who had lost

801
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,220
his speech-- he could only say
two things, "tan," and he

802
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,850
could swear like crazy.

803
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:07,950
And our current thought about
that is swearing that's

804
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:11,150
emotional and intuitive, not the
one where you think, OK,

805
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,640
I'm going to swear now
to scare somebody.

806
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,530
But the one-- you stub your
toe in the middle of the

807
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:16,460
night, and you really
let out a curse--

808
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,790
we think that's guided
like an animal cry

809
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:21,110
by the basal ganglia.

810
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:25,610
Those heartfelt, really
emotional cursing is not

811
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:26,500
really language.

812
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,950
It's actually the same cry an
animal makes on injury.

813
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:32,040
And it uses some of the
same neurocircuitry.

814
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,500
But for higher level cortical
stuff, the only word he could

815
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,160
say was "tan." He
died in 1871.

816
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,470
They looked at his brain, and
they found this change in the

817
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:41,190
left frontal cortex.

818
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:44,410
And we now call that Broca's
aphasia, the inability to

819
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:46,950
speak despite the
presence of--

820
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:49,040
your mouth can move, and
you can understand

821
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,850
language pretty well.

822
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,140
We'll come back to that.

823
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:54,080
So we talk about Broca's area,
and then Wernicke--

824
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,890
the Broca's area's important
for production.

825
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:58,900
And here's the kind of damage.

826
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:02,270
And we'll come back to Broca's
aphasia later in the course.

827
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,140
So this was a big hint that
there's something different

828
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,740
between the right and the
left hemispheres.

829
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,900
Now in what percentage of people
is language, especially

830
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,770
speech production, predominantly
in the left?

831
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:15,830
And our best answer for that
comes from a thing

832
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:17,340
called the Wada Test.

833
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,739
So this is a test given to
patients who are undergoing

834
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:22,620
neurosurgery for something
like epilepsy,

835
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,159
sometimes for tumors.

836
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,050
And they want to know for you
personally with great

837
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:30,780
certainty, which hemisphere is
the eloquent or speaking

838
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,320
hemisphere?

839
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,630
Because they want to remove more
tissue if they're away

840
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:39,485
from your language areas, and
less tissue if they're near

841
00:34:39,485 --> 00:34:40,219
your language areas.

842
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:42,290
Maybe they won't even do a
certain surgery if they're too

843
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,360
much in the middle of
your language areas.

844
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,449
Because in many cases, it's so
frustrating for people to lose

845
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:50,730
their ability to speak their
thoughts, that they'd rather

846
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:52,570
have the seizures, for
epilepsy, than

847
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:54,060
be unable to speak.

848
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,350
So physicians and neurosurgeons
are very worried

849
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:57,170
about that.

850
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:59,250
So what they give you is, they
give you a test where they put

851
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:01,470
in a drug called
sodium amytal.

852
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:04,810
And they inject it into your
femoral or carotid artery.

853
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,140
It feeds up.

854
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,580
And the way that the
vasculatures between the two

855
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:12,340
hemispheres-- it mostly shuts
down the operation of one

856
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:12,680
atmosphere.

857
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,950
If you're injected in this
femoral artery, it'll mostly

858
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:16,280
shut down your left.

859
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,170
In this one, it will mostly
shut down your right.

860
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:22,520
And while the patient has one
hemisphere turned off, and

861
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,390
they know this because for
example, let's say they shut

862
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,350
down this hemisphere
with the injection.

863
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,270
You're waving your arm.

864
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:29,730
It falls down because your motor
system can no longer

865
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:30,650
control your arm.

866
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:31,780
You're blind in this field.

867
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,850
We'll talk about that.

868
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:35,175
Many of the mental processes
done by this half of the brain

869
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:36,180
are shut down.

870
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,330
And then they'll test you like
crazy to see if you can talk.

871
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:39,610
They'll say, what are the
days of the week?

872
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:40,550
What's your name?

873
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,360
Name these pictures.

874
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:41,750
OK?

875
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,420
Until the drug wears off.

876
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,570
And then you come back two days
later or a day later, and

877
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:47,230
they'll inject the other side.

878
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:50,690
And they'll know with near
certainty in you which is the

879
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,780
side of your brain that
does the speaking.

880
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:57,620
And best estimates are that
something like 90% to 99% of

881
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,260
people speak from their left.

882
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:04,320
Even left-handers mostly speak
from the left hemisphere.

883
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,230
Because these are patients with
epilepsy, we're not quite

884
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,560
sure how they generalize
to everybody.

885
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,080
We wouldn't do this with
typical people.

886
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:12,370
Because these kinds of tests are
invasive and a bit risky.

887
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,850
But our best estimates are that
if you're right-handed,

888
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:18,320
it's almost certain you speak
from your left hemisphere.

889
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,880
And if you're left-handed,
about 80% of left-handed

890
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,750
people also speak from
the left hemisphere.

891
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,250
So it doesn't go by handedness,
which makes

892
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,910
handedness a bit more
of a mystery.

893
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:33,150
So now switch from grey matter
discussions to white matter.

894
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,630
In the middle of your
brain is something

895
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,500
called the corpus callosum.

896
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,190
Here it's viewed from the
middle, if we cut

897
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,160
the brain this way.

898
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:44,240
200 million myelinated fibers
that connect the similar areas

899
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,510
from the left and the right.

900
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:48,530
This is what hooks up the left
and right hemisphere

901
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,760
from spot to spot.

902
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,150
Here it is connecting--

903
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:54,470
and this is from the side view--
so it's a huge white

904
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,830
matter area.

905
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:57,330
Corpus callosum.

906
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:59,260
And people noticed it because
it was so striking.

907
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,590
But they couldn't figure
out what it does.

908
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,470
And it kind of started to
figure a little bit in

909
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:04,860
philosophical debates.

910
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,410
Would a divided brain--
if you cut the

911
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:07,660
brain down the middle--

912
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,500
would it read to separate
stores of mood,

913
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,710
predisposition, knowledge,
and memory?

914
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:13,060
That is, if your two halves of
your brain were divided from

915
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:16,470
one other, would you be
sort of two people?

916
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:18,690
Now, we're not going
to do that to you.

917
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:21,590
But the fascinating thing is,
are you two people to start

918
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:24,210
with, who talk to one
another sometimes

919
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:26,890
across your corpus callosum?

920
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,760
And William McDougall said,
well, the unity of

921
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,180
consciousness does not
depend on the unity

922
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,170
of the nervous system.

923
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:34,550
And he volunteered for
commissurotomy to cut the

924
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,880
corpus callosum.

925
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,790
Erickson noted in 1940 that
epileptic seizures would

926
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:43,640
become generalized convulsions
often in animal models--

927
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,800
if the seizure began here,
it would spread to the

928
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,540
corresponding part of the
opposite side of the brain,

929
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,040
and become a much
worse seizure.

930
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,150
So they got the idea that if
they cut the corpus callosum

931
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:55,870
in patients with severe epilepsy
who did not respond

932
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:58,060
to medications that maybe
that would make the

933
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,700
seizures less severe.

934
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,370
Does that make sense?

935
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:02,460
Because you wouldn't transmit
the seizure from the left to

936
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,760
the right or the
right to left.

937
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,790
But people were sort of
almost making jokes

938
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,220
about the corpus callosum.

939
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,770
Because they couldn't figure
out what it does.

940
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:11,300
They said, "The corpus callosum
is hardly connected

941
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,680
with the psychological
functions at all.

942
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,160
It is for transmitting seizure
activity from one hemisphere

943
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:19,070
to the other." That's kind
of a neurology joke.

944
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,170
Or Karl Lashley at Harvard,
"to keep hemispheres from

945
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:24,150
collapsing into one another."
You do have to have structure

946
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,780
to keep things from
collapsing.

947
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,570
So now I need to tell you a
word for the next couple

948
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:30,960
minutes for this to make sense,
about how your visual

949
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,030
system is organized.

950
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:35,320
So here's the world out there.

951
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,550
And if you're looking straight
ahead, everything to the left

952
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,650
people call the left visual
field, everything to the right

953
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,660
people call the right
visual field.

954
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:44,610
And we'll look at this more
next week a little bit.

955
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:47,190
But weirdly, your eyes are
not set up in that way.

956
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:49,690
You could think this eye looks
at this half, and this eye

957
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:50,710
looks at that half.

958
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:55,200
The way it's set up, each eye
looks at both fields.

959
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,410
Each eye looks at both fields.

960
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:02,860
And then the neurons that leave
the eye get organized

961
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,610
here in the optic chiasm.

962
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:08,530
So by the time they move out
towards the brain, everything

963
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:10,830
in the opposite half of the
world is reflected.

964
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:14,090
So everything that's in the
right visual field starts in

965
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:15,940
your brain in the
left hemisphere.

966
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,510
Everything that's in the left
visual field starts in your

967
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,290
brain in the right hemisphere.

968
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:21,660
Does that make sense?

969
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,690
So the first part of your smart
neocortex that knows

970
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:27,210
what's out there as you're
looking at a face, a word, a

971
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:28,550
scene, anything--

972
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:31,540
the right occipital cortex
notices what's on the left,

973
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:34,410
and the left occipital cortex
notices on the right.

974
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:37,720
Things are so seamlessly
integrated in the brain that

975
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,230
you don't ever have
that feeling.

976
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:41,230
You almost never have like,
we're getting bad signals on

977
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,560
the left here.

978
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,470
If you didn't have a course like
this, you wouldn't know

979
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:45,080
that exists.

980
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,050
And you could wonder, why on
Earth is it like that?

981
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:50,230
Is it just to torture students
and confuse them about fields,

982
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:52,390
eyes, and brains?

983
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,240
And people debate about
some evolutionary

984
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,020
history behind this.

985
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,980
But it's a great big mystery--

986
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,660
why we don't organize things
much more simply and just go

987
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,020
all the way this way.

988
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:01,700
Quite the opposite.

989
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:05,130
We have in the left posterior
areas, that's where we see the

990
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:06,290
right half of the world.

991
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:07,790
And then things get
integrated.

992
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:09,190
Is that OK?

993
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,080
Keep in mind also that our
left hemisphere moves our

994
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,900
right hand, and our
right hemisphere

995
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,540
moves our left hand.

996
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,550
So at least that's
the same story--

997
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:19,170
opposite hemisphere seeing the
opposite field, controlling

998
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:21,030
the opposite hand.

999
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:25,500
So imagine these kinds of
patients who had the surgery

1000
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,720
that divided the corpus
callosum or

1001
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,590
treatment of epilepsy.

1002
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:31,410
Let me tell you a
couple things.

1003
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:34,030
Clinically, it was pretty
rarely done.

1004
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,200
There weren't that
many of them.

1005
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,960
It's pretty rarely done
nowadays, first.

1006
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,210
Second, the first thing that
people noticed was, it didn't

1007
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:43,450
have much an effect
on the patients.

1008
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:44,750
It's a fascinating story.

1009
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:48,890
Nobody noticed anything
for decades.

1010
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:51,790
Because they didn't have the
right questions to ask.

1011
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:55,320
So these patients are not like
astounding patients, I can't

1012
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,830
believe when I see them.

1013
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,920
They seem pretty much like
the same as they were.

1014
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,300
I'll show you a video in a
couple minutes of two of them.

1015
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,230
They're not looking unusual
in most ways.

1016
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,990
But when people figured out what
to ask of them, they saw

1017
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:08,960
remarkable things.

1018
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,980
They saw two minds
in one head.

1019
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:15,530
And here's how they saw that.

1020
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:18,560
If they showed them a picture,
let's say of a spoon and a

1021
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,300
picture of a cup simultaneously
in the two

1022
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,440
fields, they would be
up briefly and go.

1023
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,400
But it's easy for you to say, I
saw a spoon and I saw a cup.

1024
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,340
They would say, what
did you see?

1025
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:32,240
And the person would
say, a cup.

1026
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,610
And that would be it.

1027
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:35,300
What did you see?

1028
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:35,710
A cup.

1029
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:40,170
Because the information in the
right visual field goes into

1030
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:41,730
the left hemisphere.

1031
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:43,560
That's the speaking
hemisphere.

1032
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:47,630
So left hemisphere says,
I saw a cup.

1033
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,780
The right hemisphere saw
this perfectly well.

1034
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:53,420
It's typically not the
speaking hemisphere.

1035
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:57,040
So that information is locked
in the right hemisphere, and

1036
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,710
it doesn't have access to the
speaking part of the brain in

1037
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:00,730
the left hemisphere.

1038
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:03,670
So each hemisphere had its own
experience, and only the left

1039
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:05,150
hemisphere could speak.

1040
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:08,260
You would integrate this
information instantly via the

1041
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,000
corpus callosum.

1042
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,690
But each hemisphere only
knew what it saw.

1043
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:16,340
And so here's another example,
which is not only that each

1044
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,870
hemisphere only knows
what it knows.

1045
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:19,400
But it's completely
ignorant that the

1046
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,170
other one knows anything.

1047
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:25,220
It's as if the two of you were
sitting next to each other and

1048
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,810
don't know each other,
are not passing notes

1049
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:29,790
or tweeting or whatever.

1050
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:32,220
It's as if like, do you know
exactly what the person next

1051
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,450
to you is thinking?

1052
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,260
No, not necessarily.

1053
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,640
So that's exactly what it is
like, like you're in one

1054
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,560
person in their brain,
in their skull.

1055
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:42,270
So they would show them a square
in the left visual

1056
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:44,480
field and a triangle in the
right visual field.

1057
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,150
You would say, I saw a square,
I saw a triangle.

1058
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:47,710
What do you want?

1059
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:48,780
Here's what happens.

1060
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:51,880
If they're asked to say,
say what did you see?

1061
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,590
And then behind a board,
draw what you saw.

1062
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:58,970
The board is there so it's
not confusing them.

1063
00:42:58,970 --> 00:42:59,660
So here's what they say.

1064
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,180
What did you see?

1065
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,090
I saw a triangle.

1066
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:03,060
Because it's in the right field,
it goes into their

1067
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,800
visual area in the
left hemisphere.

1068
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,810
That's the speaking
hemisphere.

1069
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:08,930
But if they're drawing
with their left hand,

1070
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:11,190
what do they draw?

1071
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,520
The square.

1072
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,000
Because the right hemisphere saw
a square, so the left hand

1073
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,160
is drawing, it draws
the square.

1074
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,270
So simultaneously they will say,
a triangle, and the hand

1075
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:21,590
behind the board will
draw a square.

1076
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:25,280
And the patient is not bothered
in the least.

1077
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,950
Because each hemisphere only
knows what it knows.

1078
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:31,640
The reason they have the board
there is if they didn't have

1079
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,220
the board there, then the left
hemisphere would see you

1080
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:34,320
drawing a square.

1081
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,800
And you go like, why am
I drawing a square?

1082
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,720
I saw a triangle.

1083
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,940
And the person would
be weirded out.

1084
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,190
Does that make sense?

1085
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:42,010

1086
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:43,010
But here's the thing.

1087
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:46,570
The amazing thing is both of
them have a lot of smarts by

1088
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:47,180
themselves.

1089
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:49,120
And they're completely
unaware of what the

1090
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,620
other hemisphere knows.

1091
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,960
Again, the idea is in you,
the hemispheres are

1092
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,710
talking all the time.

1093
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:55,630
But at lots of moments,
different parts of your brain

1094
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:57,270
might be knowing different
things.

1095
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:58,680
And we have a lot of
belief for that.

1096
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,690
But this is the most striking
demonstration.

1097
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:04,230
So here's a patient who was
asked to say what he saw and

1098
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:05,156
pick it up.

1099
00:44:05,156 --> 00:44:06,980
He had one instruction.

1100
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:10,640
Read what you see, and pick
it up with your left hand.

1101
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,280
So he sees the word ring.

1102
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,620
In the speaking hemisphere,
he says ring.

1103
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:17,250
His left hemisphere sees the
word key, has enough language

1104
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:18,040
to read that.

1105
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,925
And it picks up the key
behind the board.

1106
00:44:20,925 --> 00:44:23,980
And it never says, I saw two
things or anything like that

1107
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:25,660
in most cases.

1108
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:29,630
So let me stop here.

1109
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:31,570
And can we do the first video?

1110
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:33,970
So you're going to see an
example of a patient named

1111
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:37,760
Vicky who's going to be tested
by Mike Gazzaniga.

1112
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,890
You're going to see two videos
with Mike Gazzaniga when he

1113
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:40,720
was younger and when
he was older.

1114
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,870
He did a lot of the work with
these split brain patients.

1115
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:45,820
Plus, Alan Alda from MASH will
visit Mike Gazzaniga in the

1116
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:47,070
second one.

1117
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:58,600

1118
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,040
So one of the really interesting
things is these

1119
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,810
split brain patients have given
us a chance to ask, you

1120
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:07,000
and I, what are some different
ways in which the right

1121
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,395
hemisphere and left hemisphere
are your own minds?

1122
00:45:09,395 --> 00:45:12,141
And what are the things they
seem to care about, and that

1123
00:45:12,141 --> 00:45:13,300
are useful?

1124
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,425
So here's one example
from Jerre Levy.

1125
00:45:14,425 --> 00:45:16,250
It's a very clever experiment.

1126
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,600
She would show in the left
or right visual field

1127
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,330
something like this.

1128
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:24,060
And then say, in free view,
which of these two things is

1129
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,340
more similar?

1130
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:28,630
And on purpose it's ambiguous.

1131
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:30,850
On purpose you could say, well,
this is more similar

1132
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:33,630
because it has a similar
shape or appearance.

1133
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:36,600
This is more similar because I
use a spoon and a fork to eat

1134
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,470
a piece of cake.

1135
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:42,390
And if this was seen by the left
hemisphere, people would

1136
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:44,450
pick by function.

1137
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:47,440
If this was seen by the right
hemisphere, the patients would

1138
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,770
pick by appearance.

1139
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:53,460
So the ideas is that the left--
and this is the power

1140
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:56,590
of having two hemispheres in
parallel figuring out what's

1141
00:45:56,590 --> 00:46:00,480
going on-- one is figuring out
what's the information I need

1142
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,930
about shape and things like
that in the world?

1143
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:05,160
And what's the information
I need about function?

1144
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,230
And because you have two
semi-independent brains in

1145
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:11,840
you, you're constantly figuring
out form and function

1146
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,430
and then using whatever you
need to use to solve the

1147
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:15,720
problem in front of you.

1148
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,780
Does that make sense?

1149
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:17,990
So here's another nice one.

1150
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:21,390
Here's scissors projected
into left visual field.

1151
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:24,280
The right hemisphere,
that would pick the

1152
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:24,990
spoon and the fork.

1153
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:27,940
Because the crossing shape
is resembling that.

1154
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:30,980
In the right visual field, left
hemisphere, people would

1155
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,360
pick the needle and thread.

1156
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,090
Because that functionally
goes with scissors.

1157
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:37,740
So your mind is seeing the same
thing, but in one case

1158
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:40,570
it's tuned, in the left
hemisphere, to functions, and

1159
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:43,110
the right hemisphere
to appearance.

1160
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:46,050
So these are just notes for you
going over what I said.

1161
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:49,240
So they talked about, would
you have two different

1162
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,190
consciousnesses in you?

1163
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:51,730
It's hard really to tell.

1164
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:53,740
They did one experiment with
Vicky, where they would

1165
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:56,150
present a nude picture in
the left visual field

1166
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:56,836
unexpectedly--

1167
00:46:56,836 --> 00:46:59,790
and this was a long time ago,
it was a shocking thing.

1168
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:01,920
And the patient would
blush and giggle.

1169
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,480
When asked to explain why you
were blushing and giggling,

1170
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,680
all she could say is, oh doctor,
you have some machine.

1171
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,780
She knows something funny
happened and inappropriate.

1172
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:13,270
She can't tell you just in the
language in the hemisphere

1173
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:13,820
that saw it.

1174
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:16,120
And so she gives this other
kind of description.

1175
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,320
Another kind of a favorite
one is the dresses one.

1176
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:21,120
There was one patient who went
back to work in his father's

1177
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:21,870
grocery store.

1178
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:25,430
And this could be frustrating,
early on after his treatment.

1179
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:28,300
He would stock things onto a
shelf with one hand and remove

1180
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:28,860
it with the other.

1181
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:31,870
You could imagine that would
be a slow work day.

1182
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:34,630
These kinds of weird behaviors
pretty much

1183
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:36,240
clear up within weeks.

1184
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,480
After that, you have to test
to see the difference.

1185
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,830
Another one, they presented
the instructions -- walk

1186
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:43,090
across the room to the left
visual field, right

1187
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:43,480
hemisphere.

1188
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,600
Person gets up, walks
across the room.

1189
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,190
That person's asked, why did
you walk across the room?

1190
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:49,490
Person doesn't know why.

1191
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:52,090
Because their speaking
hemisphere didn't see it.

1192
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:53,930
And they'll just say something
like, I was thirsty.

1193
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:56,260
So interestingly, they
fill in motivations.

1194
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:59,050
They don't say, I don't know
why, or I have a split brain.

1195
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:00,940
What do you expect?

1196
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:03,080
I mean they're being tested
for that, right?

1197
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,290
But they seem like they want
to fill in some other

1198
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:05,770
explanation.

1199
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:07,830
And I'll show you another
example for that.

1200
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:09,440
And social psychologists
have said--

1201
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,810
because they like this--

1202
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:13,870
they said, this is an example
that people are desperate

1203
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:15,240
rationalizers for ourselves.

1204
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,220
We'll come back to this
in social psychology.

1205
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,620
You could think about whether
it's true for yourself or not.

1206
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:22,360
That when things are
contradictory, we don't say,

1207
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,810
oh, things are contradictory.

1208
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:28,240
We say, well, here's why, as we
explain our own behavior,

1209
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,370
that we have to rationalize
our own behavior.

1210
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:33,720
So here's the example.

1211
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:34,650
Here's the picture.

1212
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:36,830
So here's a split
brain patient.

1213
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:44,930
And he's shown pairs of pictures
in visual fields.

1214
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:46,900
And he's supposed to pick two
of them in free vision, then

1215
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,890
relate to what he sees.

1216
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:51,010
Here's the picture
that he sees.

1217
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:53,490
Boom, this goes up
and goes away.

1218
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:57,180
Now both hands go and pick
something related to what the

1219
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:58,450
person just saw.

1220
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:00,420
OK So this is shown briefly.

1221
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:01,860
It disappears.

1222
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:03,860
This hand--

1223
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:05,770
let me do this right--

1224
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:07,610
the chicken went to this
part of the brain that

1225
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:08,480
controls this hand.

1226
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,130
So the claw goes
to the rooster.

1227
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:15,372
This hemisphere saw a snowy
scene, controls this hand and

1228
00:49:15,372 --> 00:49:18,290
it goes for the shovel.

1229
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:20,620
So now they're going to make
the patient confront the

1230
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:23,820
weirdness of what he just did.

1231
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:24,780
His hand went out.

1232
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:27,010
Each hemisphere points
to what it saw.

1233
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:29,480
And again, his answer could
be, I'm in an experiment.

1234
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,850
You're constantly tricking me.

1235
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:31,720
I know that.

1236
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:34,790
Basically they know that,
they're in an experiment.

1237
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:37,480
But his answer is,
I saw a claw--

1238
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,780
that's the speaking
hemisphere.

1239
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:39,980
I picked the chicken.

1240
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:43,880
OK, that's fine, left hemisphere
is speaking.

1241
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,050
And then you have
to clean out the

1242
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:46,820
chicken shed with a shovel.

1243
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:48,210
OK You understand?

1244
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:54,210
He's creating a story to make
his behavior seem coherent.

1245
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:56,890
Rather than just saying, I'm
an experimental subject and

1246
00:49:56,890 --> 00:49:58,700
that's why you're testing me.

1247
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,490
Here's the last thing I want to
show you for two minutes.

1248
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:02,630
And then I'm going to show you
a film that touches on this.

1249
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:05,740
Psychologists are interested in
understanding also in what

1250
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:08,460
way we see the forests
and the trees.

1251
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:12,230
You see the bumper stickers,
think globally, act locally.

1252
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:15,560
Let's talk about global and
local, or parts and wholes.

1253
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:19,510
So the whole here is H. And the
locals are S. Does that

1254
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:20,000
makes sense?

1255
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,440
It's a way to operationalize an
experiment looking at the

1256
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:27,190
forest versus the
trees of S's.

1257
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:31,500
Here the whole is the C, and
the local elements are O's.

1258
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:34,290
And there's a painter who
did beautiful pictures.

1259
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:35,990
You'll see another example.

1260
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:40,370
But he made whole faces out
of vegetable parts.

1261
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,760
OK, do you see that?

1262
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,940
Every part here of this face,
if you look at it piece by

1263
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:49,540
piece, is a different
vegetable or fruit.

1264
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:51,770
So it's a sort of play on this
thing, and you'll see the

1265
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:52,400
movie that way.

1266
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,980
He made the whole face
of the parts of this.

1267
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:57,360
But here's what split
brain patients do.

1268
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,810
And I'll show you something
else in a moment.

1269
00:50:58,810 --> 00:51:02,280
They're asked shortly after
surgery to copy this.

1270
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,970
It's right in front of
them all the time.

1271
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:06,300
It's right in front of
them all the time.

1272
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:09,100
Just copy what's right
in front of you.

1273
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:12,190
If they do it with their left
hand, right hemisphere, you

1274
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:15,830
see that you get the forest
but not the trees.

1275
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:16,740
Here's the trees, and
then they don't

1276
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,710
look that good, honestly.

1277
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:23,360
But still, there's some
Y-ish thing there.

1278
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,010
Copy this.

1279
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:24,890
It's right in front of you.

1280
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:27,870
If it's the left hand, you get
the forest but not the parts.

1281
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:29,620
If it's the right hand,
you get the

1282
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,050
parts but not the forest.

1283
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:31,890
Does that make sense?

1284
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:34,530
It's as if each hemisphere is
one hemisphere-- the left

1285
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:37,240
hemisphere is seeing the
parts, and the right

1286
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,830
hemisphere is seeing
the whole.

1287
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:39,660
So that's awesome.

1288
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:41,850
Because you don't have to
be global or local.

1289
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:45,970
Your mind is simultaneously
figuring out the local parts

1290
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:47,270
and the global parts.

1291
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:50,010
And then you can use whatever
is the useful information.

1292
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:53,870
Your mind, because you have
multiple brains in you, is

1293
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:55,790
sort of figuring out what
it needs to do.

1294
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:58,690
Last thing I'll show you, and
then we'll do one more video.

1295
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:03,370
Here are patients who have
injuries after stroke.

1296
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,670
It's the same idea, though.

1297
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:06,390
So here's what they
have to copy.

1298
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:07,770
It's right in front of them.

1299
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:08,960
Just copy it exactly.

1300
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,350
That's all they have to do.

1301
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:16,970
If the patient has damage on the
right, he loses his sense

1302
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:18,540
of wholeness.

1303
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:21,890
You see there's lots of Z's,
that's the parts perceived by

1304
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:23,580
the intact left hemisphere.

1305
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:25,400
But the right hemisphere
is not giving very much

1306
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,010
information about the whole.

1307
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:30,540
Here's another patient with
left hemisphere damage.

1308
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:32,940
That person fails to appreciate
the parts,

1309
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:33,770
but gets the whole.

1310
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:35,210
Here's the same thing
down here.

1311
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:37,990
A patient with right hemisphere
damage appreciates

1312
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:42,440
the parts in the intact left
hemisphere, but doesn't

1313
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:45,910
appreciate the whole in the
injured right hemisphere.

1314
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:48,680
Conversely, here's the injured
left hemisphere.

1315
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:50,110
That patient copies the whole.

1316
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:51,900
The right hemisphere gets
it, left hemisphere

1317
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:54,820
is missing the parts.

1318
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:55,820
The amazing thing?

1319
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:57,220
It's right in front of them.

1320
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:58,430
They're copying it.

1321
00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:02,820
But if your brain is injured, it
no longer appreciates that

1322
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:06,580
the whole exists or that
a part exists.

1323
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:08,880
It's as if it wasn't there.

1324
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,720
So that's how much our mind
is what our brain

1325
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,030
does in this regard.

1326
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:14,110
And so if we do the last video
you'll see that again.

1327
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:25,288

1328
00:53:25,288 --> 00:53:27,250
Any questions on what you saw?

1329
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:29,860
So I would say neurons
are unbelievably--

1330
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:31,730
we can't even begin to
figure out your brain

1331
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:32,560
at the neuron level.

1332
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,740
We're so far from that.

1333
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:37,410
The big message from this last
part besides hemispheric

1334
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:40,420
specialization is that
your brain--

1335
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:41,660
and we'll show you this
over and over

1336
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:42,790
again in this course--

1337
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:46,840
is a society of semi-independent
brains doing

1338
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:50,500
their own thing, sharing
information as needed.

1339
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:53,400
And the more we study the brain,
the more we understand

1340
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,860
how many parts of you there are
that are semi-independent

1341
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:57,860
and autonomous.

1342
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,110
Thanks.

1343
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:18,068
