10
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,710
PROFESSOR: Good afternoon.

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,908

12
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:38,610
So we've come to a topic that
I think feels to us like

13
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,870
intuitively almost the core of
psychology might be about is

14
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:43,348
personality.

15
00:00:43,348 --> 00:00:47,172
Why are some things easy
for us and hard for us?

16
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,810
Why do we like some things
or something else?

17
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:52,824
Why do people around us behave
kindly or rudely, supportively

18
00:00:52,824 --> 00:00:55,184
or loyally or whatever?

19
00:00:55,184 --> 00:00:58,870
What can we understand about
personality scientifically?

20
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:02,382
So how do psychologists try
to study it in a somewhat

21
00:01:02,382 --> 00:01:04,379
systematic fashion?

22
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,970
Some key concepts that we're
finding are traits, states,

23
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,630
and context.

24
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:10,180
Traits--

25
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,170
I'll come to these.

26
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,750
And then finally some brain
correlates for personality.

27
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,130
So I love this quote, because
I think it's about

28
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,980
individuality, which says, every
person is in certain

29
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,930
respects like all
other people--

30
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:22,780
and we think that's true.

31
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:27,190
There's something deeply similar
among all humans, also

32
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,700
about psychology, also
about our brains.

33
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,550
Like some other people, that
is, there's dimensions of

34
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,450
individuality, or like some
other people, like if we're a

35
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,740
male or female, if we're this
age or that age, this culture

36
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,180
or that culture, like math or
don't like math, like vanilla

37
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,080
ice cream or don't
like ice cream.

38
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,740
And then finally, we come down
to the unique set of things

39
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,130
that make you you.

40
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,920
And that's very hard to study,
the unique things

41
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,510
that make you you.

42
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:55,770
But the second level, dimensions
of individuality,

43
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,520
we can study in personality.

44
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,480
It's obviously a big one
that we feel in our own

45
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,460
lives and around us.

46
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:08,889
So this is the old original
"Star Trek." Like many

47
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:12,660
programs, or in TV series, it
plays out really in part--

48
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,780
they go from galaxy to galaxy
and struggle with various

49
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,330
opponents, civilizations.

50
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,520
But it almost always
comes down to a

51
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,820
personality thing, right?

52
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,450
The Captain Kirk who wants to
be aggressive and charge in

53
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,300
there and do something very
emotional, Spock who's the

54
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,920
pure rational machine, and McCoy
who represents a sort of

55
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,930
humane touch, as opposed to
the rational thought.

56
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,260
And somewhere in between is the
man who has to pick the

57
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,650
action to command
the ship, right?

58
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,490
So every show plays out
with him asking him

59
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:41,560
to be human, right?

60
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,060
And him asking him to be
rational, and him killing

61
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,690
somebody who's trouble making.

62
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,710
OK.

63
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,860
So what do we mean
by personality?

64
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,710
A set of behavioral, emotional,
and cognitive

65
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,860
tendencies that people
display over time.

66
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,070
When we talk about personality,
we really mean

67
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,140
something that we think is
consistent in ourselves or in

68
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,750
other people.

69
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,700
It's that somebody is
shy, somebody's

70
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,120
helpful, somebody's rude.

71
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,340
And across situations, not just
one place, one time, but

72
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,390
pretty regularly.

73
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,130
And that varies across people.

74
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,220
That distinguishes them
from one to another.

75
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,880
Something that's kind of--

76
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,130
there's some similarities,
but people vary in this.

77
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,650
And so when people think about
this, they think in three

78
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,970
categories as they
conceptualize it.

79
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:24,690
One is traits.

80
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:29,380
By trait we mean something
that's in you that's constant

81
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,610
across situations and times.

82
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,540
But we also think of
it as a continuum.

83
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,730
So for example, we talk about
introversion/extroversion or

84
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,190
outgoingness and shyness.

85
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,780
It's not that everybody's
one or the other.

86
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,850
Along that path from being
extremely shy to extremely

87
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,550
outgoing, many of us are
somewhere in between.

88
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,550
And then we can talk about
states, how we are

89
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,800
temporarily.

90
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,140
How do we feel, excited, afraid,
that kind of stuff.

91
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,460
And then situations we're in,
because they're specific at

92
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,700
times and places, and
that influences us.

93
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,740
We're fearful, we're happy,
we're looking forward to

94
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,880
something, we're not looking
forward to something.

95
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,870
So these are different pieces
that might end up in how we

96
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:13,600
feel inside and how we
act on the world.

97
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,140
So here's a very funny thing,
because it's a very different

98
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,140
line of research than
practically anything else

99
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:18,750
that's out there.

100
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,150
Very active, because we're so
curious about personality.

101
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,190
Here's how people have basically
approached it.

102
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:28,750
Not everybody, but the main line
scientific perspective.

103
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,800
They looked in the dictionary,
originally in the 1930s, for

104
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,270
this line of work, and they
said, let's look at all the

105
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,420
adjectives in the dictionary
that we think might describe

106
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,010
personality in some sense.

107
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:46,240
They found nearly 18,000 words
in the dictionaries that

108
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,420
seemed to be adjectives for
describing people, and

109
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,420
something that might be
about personality.

110
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,730
Whether you're affable, or
amiable, congenial, convivial,

111
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,510
cordial, friendly, genial,
sociable, welcoming.

112
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,670
These are all synonyms, right?

113
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:03,010
They all mean roughly the
same thing, we think.

114
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:07,250
But they found 18,000 terms
there because we think a lot

115
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,050
about other people, and talk a
lot about other people, and

116
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,870
other people are interesting
to us.

117
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,610
And as I said, we're not going
to study 18,000 dimensions of

118
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,330
personality, especially
when lots of them

119
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,910
overlap like this.

120
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,100
So what we're going to do is
see, are there some underlying

121
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,020
traits, a manageable set of
personality traits or

122
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:28,110
dimensions, that many of these
18,000 adjectives sort

123
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,050
of boil down to.

124
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,160
So a manageable set of
personality dimensions.

125
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,780
So how do people measure
personality in some way?

126
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,380
And for those of us who like
to measure things by

127
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,090
behavior-- you do a test, or
you push a button, or we

128
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,180
measure your brain--

129
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,160
personality research is always
funny, because the bulk of it

130
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,230
is people's self report
about themselves.

131
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:51,930
And about the last thing most
of us in psychology trust is

132
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,050
people's reports about
themselves.

133
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,840
And what we think is--

134
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,260
for many reasons that we can
talk about a little bit--

135
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:03,010
what we think is that people,
when they fill out a piece of

136
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:05,850
paper describing themselves,
they start to have all kinds

137
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,540
of thoughts like, OK, I'm
outgoing, but compared to who?

138
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:13,230

139
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,630
Do I want to fill this out like
I really like to think

140
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,500
about myself, or how I think I
really am, or am I sometimes

141
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,330
this way and sometimes
that way, which

142
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,140
is the right answer.

143
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:21,560
OK?

144
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,460
So all these things bother us
as researchers, but we don't

145
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,020
have a more direct path
towards personality.

146
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,490
So we can interview people
about their personality.

147
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,300
We can observe--

148
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,500
I'll talk about some studies
that involve observation.

149
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,150
But by far the dominant mode
of collecting somewhat

150
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:37,810
quantitative data about
personality are questionnaires

151
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,720
of the kind you just got
handed out to you.

152
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,370
Thank you, Tyler.

153
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,750
And the most famous one of all,
which you have in your

154
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,310
hands, is the so-called big five
personality dimensions.

155
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,400
There's many other aspects of
personality-- we'll talk about

156
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,370
that-- but this is the
most famous one.

157
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,060
And it was derived in some
sense objectively and

158
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,930
empirically from factor
analysis like this.

159
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,680
What they said is we have this
huge number of terms, but many

160
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,740
of them are either very similar
to one another, or

161
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,540
what we might call
anti-correlative, they're sort

162
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,650
of opposites.

163
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:11,680
So for example, if a person is
rude, are we also likely to

164
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,520
think of them as kind?

165
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,860
Now you could have--

166
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,490
there's many movies of the rude
senior citizen who turns

167
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,620
out to have a heart of gold
underneath, right?

168
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,110
But in general, if you say this
person's rude, usually

169
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,990
they'll go, and they're
so kind, right?

170
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,680
We think of them as sort of
opposites in personality.

171
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,040
If somebody's dependable
or carefree.

172
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,730
Now, maybe you know somebody
who's both dependable and

173
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,260
carefree, but we tend to think
carefree people are not so

174
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:35,900
dependable.

175
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,280
They can be delightful
dependable people.

176
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,840
But now, rude-- you can be
dependable and rude or

177
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,560
dependable and polite, right?

178
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,960
OK, so get a feeling of that.

179
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,710
So they have people fill out
tons of pieces of paper saying

180
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,790
how do they feel these factors
describe them.

181
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:56,960
And they start out with this
huge universe of terms, and

182
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,600
then they try to boil it down,
and boil it down, and boil it

183
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,040
down, by looking at--

184
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,200
Oh, this doesn't show up
very well, does it?

185
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,560
Oh, well.

186
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,260
Correlations--

187
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,640
you have the notes.

188
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:11,150
So you can guess without being
able to see, you can guess--

189
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,710
let's pick two things.

190
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:18,900
If I pick the adjectives
carefree and dependable, kind

191
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,650
of go together or
not go together?

192
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,500
Doesn't tend to go together in
people describing themselves.

193
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,940
How about hard working
and dependable?

194
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,370
Kind of goes together.

195
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,419
So they said, we can take a lot
of these adjectives and

196
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:36,409
say piles of them go in one
area, well, we'll just pick a

197
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,409
few words to describe
that dimension.

198
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:40,400
Piles of them go in
another area.

199
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:46,090
And they boil it down basically
by factor analysis,

200
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:49,800
and they end up with five
big factors in this

201
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,260
most widely used one.

202
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,520
So here's two of them.

203
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,440
And here comes a big thing.

204
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,540
They have the factor which is
basically just mathematically

205
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,950
a set of adjectives that travel
together, that are

206
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:04,080
highly correlated when people
describe themselves.

207
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,855
And they're somewhat
anti-correlated or

208
00:09:05,855 --> 00:09:07,470
uncorrelated with the
other dimensions.

209
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,950
That's purely empirical.

210
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,380
Now, though, they have the set
of adjectives, like carefree

211
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:16,670
or dependable, not hard-working
or hard-working.

212
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,960
Now they have to say, what's the
label I'm going to put on

213
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,500
that dimension of human
personality?

214
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,700
There's no science for that.

215
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,730
That's judgment.

216
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,220
But five of them get fixed.

217
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,220
And once these got fixed,
they've become the terminology

218
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,560
of the field.

219
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,780
So they said, we're going to
call one conscientiousness.

220
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,170
Those are people who say they're
not carefree, they are

221
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,820
dependable, and they
are hard-working.

222
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,810
Does that make sense?

223
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,050
Or somebody's agreeable--

224
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,440
that's one of the other big
five, separate five.

225
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,970
If somebody says, I'm pretty
compliant, I'm pretty kind,

226
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,070
and I'm seldom rude.

227
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,840
So I'm going to give you
a minute to try this.

228
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,160
You can fill it out fully.

229
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,320
So your piece of paper
that you have is a

230
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,910
version of this test.

231
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,110
It's the real thing.

232
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,620
One side tells you
how to score it.

233
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,880
Don't look at that, the other
side at the bottom.

234
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,430
Just try a few items for fun
if you feel like it.

235
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:12,160
And you can fill it out later
and score yourself or print it

236
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,860
out from the notes and
score your friends.

237
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,230
Use it responsibly,
the knowledge.

238
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:20,390

239
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,610
And you can just have an
intuition of what does it

240
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:25,370
mean, because almost all
personality research, almost

241
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,830
all of it does exactly what
you're doing now, which is

242
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:31,160
gives you a piece of paper, and
have you describe yourself

243
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,410
to yourself.

244
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:41,160

245
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,930
I'll give you a minute just
to get a feeling for it.

246
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,880
I think it's kind of fun.

247
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,990
And the feeling you
get, like--

248
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,860
so people worry about stuff,
like who are you comparing

249
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,560
yourself to?

250
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,250
If you're outgoing,
compared to who?

251
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,000
Compared to Robin
Williams, OK?

252
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,560
Maybe not so much.

253
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,290
Compared to your roommate?

254
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,170
Maybe yes.

255
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,520
So all these questions, like
where do you get these number

256
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,740
from, how do you come to these
answers, and so on.

257
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,670
People worry about polishing
your image.

258
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:08,235
Oh yes, I'm always polite.

259
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:11,910
I'm nearly perfect when I'm
asked to describe myself, OK?

260
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,510
So to the extent that
people did that, it

261
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,180
wouldn't work, right?

262
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,200
Because everybody would look
perfect all the time.

263
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:22,310

264
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:26,640
So these big five are openness,
conscientiousness,

265
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,880
extroversion, agreeableness,
and neuroticism.

266
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,060
And for memorizing for tests,
OCEAN is the acronym.

267
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,970

268
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,790
These were the ones that have
come out as five separable

269
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,220
dimensions that seem to cover
a tremendous amount of

270
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,620
individual descriptions of human
personality, and are

271
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,870
widely used in research.

272
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,450

273
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,635
So here's your big
five inventory.

274
00:11:51,635 --> 00:11:54,670

275
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,590
Here's--

276
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,460
on the backside, how to score
it, if you feel like figuring

277
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,900
out what this test would
say about yourself, OK?

278
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,740
You could be honest with your
scoring, because we're not

279
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,470
going to collect it, it's just
you describing you to

280
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,720
yourself, if you're curious.

281
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,205

282
00:12:11,205 --> 00:12:12,370
And now I'm going to go on.

283
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,030
And you're more than welcome
to finish it

284
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:14,640
whenever you want.

285
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,380
It's yours to keep.

286
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,090
And here's how we would score
it, or you would score it.

287
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,520
It tells you on the
bottom what to do.

288
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,260
For conscientiousness--

289
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,310
and we'll come back
to this, it's a

290
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,180
really interesting measure.

291
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,960
If you rate yourself as somebody
who does a thorough

292
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,880
job, is a reliable worker,
perseveres until the task is

293
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,620
finished, does things
efficiently, and makes plans

294
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,790
and follows through with them.

295
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,650
The higher you rate yourself on
those-- this makes sense--

296
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:39,300
you're more conscientious,
right?

297
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,870
The less you say, that you're
somewhat careless, you tend to

298
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:47,290
be disorganized, you tend to
be lazy, and you're easily

299
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,090
distracted, well, those
are negative

300
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,530
things for that dimension.

301
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:51,540
Does that make sense?

302
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,060
So you have to watch when you
score it which are the

303
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,980
positive and which are the
negative as you score them,

304
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,980
would you get a plus
or a minus.

305
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,020
And they try to make it either
way, so that if you constantly

306
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:03,120
say yes, you ought not to score
anything that makes

307
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,810
sense, even to yourself.

308
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:08,760
Anyway, so here's the big
questions, right?

309
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,380
All this sort of research
behind or this factor

310
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,050
analysis, you'd want
to know two things.

311
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:12,680
Are they stable?

312
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,090
Do they really describe
a person across

313
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,750
situations and time?

314
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,420
That's what we mean
by personality.

315
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,010
And secondly, do they predict
behaviors and life outcomes?

316
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,110
Is there something about them
that goes with things that we

317
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,450
care about, variably
across people?

318
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:31,050
So where people have looked at
this over some number of

319
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:34,470
years, it correlates 0.5
to 0.7 across 30

320
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,980
or 40 years of life.

321
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:40,360
Height and sex, to think about
it, correlates 0.4.

322
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,880
Again, height and sex is kind of
an-- people will pick that

323
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,480
to think about.

324
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,100
On average, men tend to be
taller than women, but lots of

325
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,330
women are taller than lots
of individual men, OK?

326
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,530
So it's a stronger relationship
across time.

327
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,520
It's more stable than
what you'd predict

328
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,180
by height and sex.

329
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,830
And here's something
really interesting.

330
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,890
They tested people across
seven years-- within

331
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:03,970
childhood, within young
adulthood, within the 30s, and

332
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,220
in the 50 to 70 age range.

333
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,770
And here's something
kind of striking.

334
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:09,930
If you test people twice across
seven years, starting

335
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:14,730
from infancy as best you can--
or questions about them

336
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,980
because they can't
fill out forms--

337
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,970
to adulthood, the striking thing
is that the older you

338
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:22,780
get, the more consistent
you become across

339
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,240
a seven year period.

340
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,430
The older you get, the more
consistent you become.

341
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,910
So how might you
interpret that?

342
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:33,070

343
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,140
There's a couple different
ways you

344
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,750
could think about that.

345
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,990
The older you become, the more
consistent you become in

346
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,160
describing your personality--

347
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,550
let's pretend your descriptions
are accurate--

348
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:45,940
the more consistent your
personality is.

349
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,050
Did you expect that?

350
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:47,820
Is that what you expect?

351
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,117
Something opposite?

352
00:14:50,117 --> 00:14:51,115
Yeah?

353
00:14:51,115 --> 00:14:53,776
AUDIENCE: They get older, they
kind of develop habits and get

354
00:14:53,776 --> 00:14:55,110
set in their ways.

355
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,540
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

356
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,620
So there's two ways to describe
getting older.

357
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,880
Like me, I get set in my ways.

358
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,840
Right?

359
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,420
That's OK.

360
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,770
Or I'll say it the other way,
we discover the ways that we

361
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:07,700
really like.

362
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,660
OK?

363
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,620
My friend Robert Sapolsky at
Stanford, who writes fantastic

364
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,410
books and who's a fantastic
lecturer, had an essay where

365
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:19,960
he said he noticed in his late
40s or 50s, that the people in

366
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:24,100
his working lab that they were
playing irritating music.

367
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,970
It was just bothering him when
they were playing the music.

368
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:30,390
And it was music that people of
your generation listen to.

369
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,450
He said, why is it irritating?

370
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,860
Because when he played his--

371
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,590
when he played The Beatles or
whatever, they were irritating

372
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,050
to his parents, OK.

373
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,440
So what's going on?

374
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,430
And he said, oh.

375
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:42,440
And so he did a little informal
study, he talked to

376
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,230
people of different ages and
people in restaurants, they

377
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:49,020
said, at what age do people seem
to stop wanting to do new

378
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:52,180
things, and get stuck in their
ways, or find what they like

379
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,170
and stick with it?

380
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,810
And there's no one answer.

381
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:57,180
But he found a tremendous number
of people, by about 30

382
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:01,010
to 35, that's their music, they
like sushi or they don't

383
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,100
like sushi.

384
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,910
They have their set of stuff
that they have going for them

385
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:06,920
or they don't like.

386
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,500
And so you could say they
get stuck in their ways.

387
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,730
You could say they discover
what they like

388
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:12,920
and stick with it.

389
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,260
And here's an age more of
exploration and variability.

390
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,150
Who knows?

391
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,200
But it's kind of interesting,
the older you get, the more

392
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,962
consistent you get.

393
00:16:21,962 --> 00:16:23,550
Is this flexibility?

394
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,080
Is this chaos?

395
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,220
You could look at
it either way.

396
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,020
There's no real answer.

397
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,010
People have looked at these
scores and asked whether

398
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:31,815
things like--

399
00:16:31,815 --> 00:16:35,010
do they vary with
age and gender?

400
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:41,270
So for example, these broken
lines are neuroticism, which

401
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,010
is a funny label.

402
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:42,970
It really means--

403
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:45,830
neuroticism is the bad side
of it, stability is the

404
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:46,490
good side of it.

405
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:50,650
You could also say too stable
could be boring and inert.

406
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:53,930
You could relabel these
things pretty much.

407
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:58,330
But on average, women's scores
are a little bit less stable

408
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:01,280
than men, a little bit more
outgoing, a little bit.

409
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,210
By age, you get a few trends.

410
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:05,760
This will not surprise
you, actually.

411
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:12,210
So for neuroticism--
again, stability--

412
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,540
that neuroticism decreases
with age.

413
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,640
People get more stable and they
get more conscientious as

414
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,140
they get older.

415
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,460
You kind of expect that.

416
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,770
People get more used to their
habits and more stuck in their

417
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:25,829
ways, that we would
call stability.

418
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:29,090
So, let's ask for people who
score high or low on these

419
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,330
measures, what do
they go with?

420
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,970
So for these five fundamental
personality measures.

421
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,010
So people who score highly on
the neuroticism scale-- again,

422
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,410
these labels are tricky--

423
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:42,100
but it means ranging from very
stable and emotional sense to

424
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,680
very labile--

425
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,790
they pay more attention to
threat in the environment,

426
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:48,280
more stressed when given a
surprise math test, have a

427
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,320
higher divorce rate,
more susceptible to

428
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,690
depression and anxiety.

429
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:56,000
At the very, very, very highest
scores of neuroticism,

430
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,290
it's a big risk for depression
and anxiety.

431
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:01,900
And one of the deep questions
always is, to what extent are

432
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:06,250
what we call psychiatric labels
extremes of personality

433
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,060
or something beyond
personality?

434
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,890
This is a much deeper issue
than you'd think.

435
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,840
We'll come back to
it in psychiatry.

436
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,840
Because some people say there's
no such thing, for

437
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,100
example, as social
anxiety disorder.

438
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,590
It's a recent invention
for what people

439
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:21,540
used to call shyness.

440
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,540
I don't think that's
right, mostly.

441
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:27,270
But this debate goes on, because
there's not a sharp

442
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:32,410
boundary between being a little
shy and so shy that you

443
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,980
don't leave your house
to meet people.

444
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,950
That's kind of an extreme.

445
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,330
But most people--

446
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,890
it's not one person is here and
the next person's here,

447
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,380
there's people all along
the continuum.

448
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,090
Where you draw the line is
a challenging issue.

449
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,370
Highly extroverted people versus
highly introverted,

450
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,410
that sort of shyness
and outgoingness.

451
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:49,400
This will be a big surprise.

452
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,930
Highly extroverted people-- by
these personality measures--

453
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,200
attend more parties, they're
more popular, they're

454
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,140
identified as leaders in
college, they live with and

455
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,380
work with more people, they're
less disturbed by sudden loud

456
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,400
sounds or intense stimuli.

457
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,690
You can do experiments in a
laboratory and get these

458
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,960
differences.

459
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,080
None of these are sort
of surprising.

460
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,260
They're just telling you there's
something correct

461
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,110
about these personality
measures.

462
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:11,410
Highly agreeable people are more
willing to lend money,

463
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,750
have higher high school
grades, and have

464
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,860
fewer arrests as adults.

465
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,760
But the cool thing is not--

466
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,560
I mean, you're not surprised.

467
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,690
But the fact that they fill out
a questionnaire sitting at

468
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,870
a desk like you do, predicts to
some decent extent over the

469
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,830
population whether they'll
go to jail or not.

470
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,330
That's kind of interesting.

471
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,700
More openness to experience.

472
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,140
You're more likely to major
in the humanities--

473
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,130

474
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,380
not us--

475
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:38,330

476
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:42,040
change careers in midlife,
perform better in job training

477
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,810
programs, and play a
musical instrument.

478
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,970
But these are massive
statistical things.

479
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:49,630
Because kind of conversely--

480
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:53,290
well, you know there's very
interesting relations between

481
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,500
musicality and sort of math
and science backgrounds.

482
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,900
So that seems to go
against this.

483
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,370
So these are big averages.

484
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:02,860
Maybe, I think, in some ways the
most interesting one, for

485
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,930
practical reasons, has turned
out to be conscientiousness,

486
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,370
and that's like doing what
you're supposed to do.

487
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,830
More sexually faithful to
spouses, higher job ratings,

488
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,980
smoke less, drink less, drive
more safely, live longer, less

489
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,690
risk for Alzheimer's Disease--
spectacularly less risk.

490
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:17,800
OK?

491
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,660
And also play a musical
instrument?

492
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:23,280

493
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,620
So the Alzheimer's Disease is
kind of interesting, because

494
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,880
what we think is happening--
and we don't really know--

495
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,220
is this.

496
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,770
So you may know there's
basically one gene, now, more

497
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:35,950
recently, a couple other
genes, identified as

498
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,020
significant risk genes
for Alzheimer's.

499
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,080
But the one powerful
well-identified one is the

500
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,190
so-called APOE gene.

501
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,740
And that is a significant
risk gene.

502
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:48,920
If you're homologous for that,
you have a higher risk for

503
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,060
Alzheimer's.

504
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,910
But that best-known,
best-characterized gene is a

505
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:59,100
far smaller risk factor,
mathematically, than being low

506
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,180
conscientiousness.

507
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,920
And we don't know what that
really means, right?

508
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,460
What's your guess?

509
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,730
And nobody knows.

510
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,280
This is just an empirical
finding, and it's been

511
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,400
replicated a number of times.

512
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,900
What's your guess?

513
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,040
So conscientious people do
what they're supposed to.

514
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,850
All the things that you're
supposed to, in the morning,

515
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:18,190
get up and do, they do
them pretty well.

516
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,440
Right?

517
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,090

518
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:24,690
Make your bed, do your laundry
regularly, brush your teeth

519
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:28,210
regularly, have your medical
appointments regularly, eat

520
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,830
well, exercise, all the things
that everybody tells you is

521
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,560
good for you, conscientious
people are more

522
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,070
likely to do it.

523
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:33,890
Yeah?

524
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,360
AUDIENCE: It's sort
of an analogy.

525
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,300
The thing is that someone who
continuously uses them more--

526
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,260
more of the pipeline,
basically.

527
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,036
Keep water going through them,
makes it less likely that it

528
00:21:43,036 --> 00:21:45,160
will clog the pipes--

529
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,910
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's
something like that.

530
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,060
The pipeline analogy.

531
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,440
If you keep flushing it
regularly, instead of clogging

532
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,130
it up with bad things that are
bad for you or whatever.

533
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:55,180
In the end, there has to be
a biological mechanism.

534
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,020
In the end, there has to be.

535
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,380
But maybe it's a lifetime
of doing healthy things.

536
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,940
And they add up and up, day in,
day out, month in, month

537
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,410
out, year in, year out.

538
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:05,190
That they somehow, in some
way, either fend off

539
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,980
Alzheimer's disease or diminish
its expression for

540
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,570
much longer.

541
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:09,690
Does that sound OK?

542
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:13,170
But it's a very compelling
finding.

543
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:13,400
All right.

544
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,040
So then there's always a
fun question up for our

545
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,460
personality, and there
will be one big

546
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,570
surprise here, I think.

547
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,325
I'll tell you this
is our surprise.

548
00:22:20,325 --> 00:22:22,430
[INAUDIBLE] was reminding
me that--

549
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,940
there's a parents visiting
weekend, which

550
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,260
is not today, right?

551
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,160
But a few years ago, I gave this
lecture on that, and I

552
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,870
came to a conclusion that
parents will find impossible,

553
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:34,390
untrue, and very disturbing.

554
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,030
Get ready.

555
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:38,280
Here we go.

556
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,560
Again, we're always curious,
our personalities--

557
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,310
whether we're outgoing
or not, agreeable or

558
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,500
not, open or not--

559
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,560
how much of that is in our genes
at birth, how much is

560
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,610
that in our environment in terms
of parental influence,

561
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,440
and sibling influence, and
school, and so on.

562
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,800
So the usual way to this, until
we know the true biology

563
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,110
of this, are estimates from
twin studies and children

564
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,430
reared apart and reared
separately.

565
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,330
So let me start with
the twin studies.

566
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:06,270
So these are identical twins in
green versus dizygotic or

567
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,260
fraternal twins, shared

568
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,910
environment, some shared genes.

569
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:13,230
The difference about this is
thought to be an estimate of

570
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,040
pure genetic heritability.

571
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,030
And say you get a pretty
good one--

572
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,510
extroversion and openness
the most, maybe--

573
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:26,000
but definitely a genetic
contribution to personality.

574
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,390
That's the evidence
from twin studies.

575
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:32,180
And it's even impressive if
you do not self report

576
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,160
questionnaires, but behaviors
that people describe,

577
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,340
activities they do.

578
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,060
Time spent watching television,
number of

579
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,870
childhood accidents, tendency
for marriage and divorce,

580
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:43,230
religious attitudes, your
balance between work and

581
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:46,340
leisure, do you want to be at
work all the time or leisure,

582
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,710
or what the balance
ought to be.

583
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:51,820
0.5, that's about half
heritable, estimated.

584
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,440
Happiness--

585
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,760
we'll come back to happiness
ratings.

586
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,040
The way people rate happiness,
it turns out, is if you do a

587
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,760
one to seven scale,
that's the field.

588
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,330
OK?

589
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:01,310
Seven means happy all
the time, one means

590
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:03,230
miserable all the time.

591
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,710
That's the way happiness
research is done.

592
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,140
In the last lecture, we'll talk
about what people think

593
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,040
people need to do to be happy.

594
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,150
But one thing we know is that
people tend to have happiness

595
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:13,950
set-points--

596
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,340
you may know this amongst your
friends or yourselves--

597
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:19,430
that is, on average, a person
will be very happy, or

598
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:23,110
moderately happy, or pretty
grumbly most of the time.

599
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:23,680
OK?

600
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,530
Something happens in their lives
that's really good or

601
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,390
bad, they'll move a little bit,
but they'll slide right

602
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,030
back to it.

603
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:31,070
There's nothing better or worse
about one or the other,

604
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,570
but it's just people tend
to be pretty set.

605
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:35,590
And the estimates from twin
studies are about half of your

606
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:39,110
chronic sense of happiness, day
in and day out, it comes

607
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,840
from genes, is the estimate.

608
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,320
So that's a big piece.

609
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,760
But here's the kind
of stunning thing.

610
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,530
And in the next couple
slides I tell you.

611
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:48,644
Let me tell you the bottom
line, let me

612
00:24:48,644 --> 00:24:51,040
tell you the evidence.

613
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,440
The empirical evidence could
support a position that

614
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,450
parents and family environments
have zero

615
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:01,490
influence on your personality.

616
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:04,400
Then the question is, what is
the environmental influence?

617
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,270
Because we know it's
not all genetic.

618
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:10,320
But wherever it's been looked at
carefully, parents and home

619
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,270
environments appear to have, as
far as they can see, nearly

620
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,820
zero influence on your
personality.

621
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,670
Now this is the thing that
drives parents crazy.

622
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,780
Because as a parent, I can
tell you, from the moment

623
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,010
they're born, or even months
before children are born, to

624
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:26,560
the moment you're no longer
around to take care of your

625
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,410
children, you want them to
develop the right kind of--

626
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,620
be a happy person,
a good person.

627
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,230
Hopefully something about
conscientiousness, do well in

628
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,340
life, right?

629
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,480
And you're doing every little
thing to encourage that.

630
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,170
The comments you make, the
schools you send them to, the

631
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:42,940
activities you encourage them to
do, you want them to have a

632
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:45,750
personality that will be happy
for them and good for them and

633
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,190
thriving, right?

634
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:51,180
So to be told that whatever you
do doesn't matter is kind

635
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,200
of a big shock.

636
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,990
And we don't really know
the depth of this.

637
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,420
And it sounds like
it's ridiculous.

638
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,090
But I can tell you the empirical
evidence kind of

639
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,390
supports it.

640
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:02,350
So for example, for the twin
studies, it makes no

641
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,940
difference at all for
personality dimensions whether

642
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:09,030
twins are raised together
or raised apart.

643
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,650
So they're in different families
or the same family--

644
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:12,550
doesn't make a difference.

645
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,600
All the heritable estimates
remain exactly the same.

646
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,080
So where are the environmental
factors coming from?

647
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,840
We believe there's environmental
factors, but we

648
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,760
can't spot them.

649
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,805
And what's fascinating about
these things is that we as

650
00:26:24,805 --> 00:26:27,010
human beings-- and this is
just an example now--

651
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:31,060
always want to understand who we
are as some sort of willful

652
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:34,150
response to our environment.

653
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:38,450
So here are two identical
twins reared apart.

654
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,760
And they're both super neat.

655
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,270
OK?

656
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:46,210
And neither one of them tells
you, well, it's in my genes,

657
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:47,320
what else was I going to do?

658
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,520
None of us mostly think that.

659
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,600
Outside of some dire
circumstances or diseases, we

660
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,860
mostly think, it's my choice
this morning whether I'm going

661
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,830
to make my bed or not.

662
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:00,020
It's my choice if I do laundry
this year or not.

663
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,206
Yeah.

664
00:27:01,206 --> 00:27:05,400
AUDIENCE: Could that other 50%
come from things part of the

665
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,060
environment like
diet or health?

666
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,290
PROFESSOR: Could the other 50%
come from things like diet or

667
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,280
other things in the
environment?

668
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,400
It could.

669
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,850
But even that tends to
go by families some.

670
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:19,720
Some families just say, here's
a few years worth of potato

671
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,230
chips, good luck.

672
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,370
Another family's going, oh my
gosh, you didn't eat carrots

673
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,500
all month long.

674
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,960
Even that tends to be,
on average, someone

675
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,880
environmental, right?

676
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,310
Both by economic opportunity,
part of the world you're in,

677
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,950
parental attitudes, right?

678
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:33,550
I agree with you.

679
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,450
It's got to be something.

680
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:37,620
And maybe we just don't have
the whole story right.

681
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,210
But here's two twins telling
you why each of

682
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:41,720
them is very neat.

683
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,230
OK?

684
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,250
The first one is, my mother.

685
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:47,720
When I was growing up-- this is
one household, one twin--

686
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,890
she always kept the house
perfectly ordered.

687
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:50,950
I learned from her.

688
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,730
What else could I do?

689
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,730
I had a model in my parent.

690
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,000
She was neat, I'm neat.

691
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,180
Here's the other twin, who
is also very neat.

692
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,080
The reason is quite simple.

693
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,420
I'm reacting to my mother,
who was a complete slob.

694
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:01,990
OK?

695
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,850
So they're complete
opposite stories.

696
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,370
I'm modeling my parents.

697
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:07,960
I'm rebelling against
my parents.

698
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,510
But you know that they're
identical twins, and they end

699
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,550
up in the same place.

700
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,433
Yeah?

701
00:28:12,433 --> 00:28:13,683
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

702
00:28:13,683 --> 00:28:25,000

703
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,920
PROFESSOR: That's another
interpretation.

704
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,000
This is a good question.

705
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,120
The question is, I'm pretending
the explanations

706
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,630
have nothing to do with
anything, and you're saying

707
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:31,700
maybe this a personality
thing.

708
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,990
Somebody who chooses to model
their parent or just somebody

709
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,400
who chooses to rebel against
their parent.

710
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,520
Maybe that's the personally
dimension, right?

711
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,770
It could be.

712
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,670

713
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,810
It's just neatness.

714
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:46,010
Twins who aren't neat tend to go
the same way and twins who

715
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:47,060
are neat tend to go
the same way.

716
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,640
About 50 percent of the effect
is in the genes.

717
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,350
I don't know.

718
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,650
I'm not saying that things
aren't there.

719
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:55,430
It's a bit of a mystery,
it's a bit of a shock.

720
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,080
So here's a couple
more things.

721
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,050
Biological, non-twin
siblings--

722
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:02,310
OK, so these are siblings
but they're not twins--

723
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,310
are far more similar
to one another

724
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,940
then adoptive siblings.

725
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,500
OK.

726
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:06,930
That's OK.

727
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:09,140
That's the genetics, right?

728
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,860
Because the adopted child
is into the family.

729
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,390
But here's a shocking one.

730
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:15,110
For personality, children are no
more similar to an adoptive

731
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:18,710
sibling than are two randomly
selected children.

732
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:22,120
So in a household, if you have
an adopted child and a

733
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,410
biological child in that
household, sharing the same

734
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:27,830
environment, they are no more
similar, one to the other,

735
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:31,350
than two random children
in the world.

736
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:34,820
OK, where is the effect
of the environment?

737
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:37,550
Where is the parental effect on
the two children in terms

738
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,240
of personality?

739
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,210
So people have mounted
this argument.

740
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:43,800
So let me pick another one.

741
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,070
Put up your hand
if you want to.

742
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,060
I'll put up my hand.

743
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:49,540
How many people grew up in a
household where one or more

744
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:52,310
parents spoke in a noticeable
accent?

745
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,340
I mean, I did.

746
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,350
Let's just try this here.

747
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:58,440
How many of you who have your
hand up-- keep your hand up--

748
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,380
did you keep your
parents' accent?

749
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,460
Where's the environment?

750
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,970
In your critical moments of
language development, you were

751
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,730
hearing that accent.

752
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:12,420
Where is the environment?

753
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,850
And you could say, well, yeah,
but there are other people

754
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:14,550
speaking other things.

755
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:18,260
Yeah, but then zero parental
influence on the way in which

756
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,520
you produce your language.

757
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,840
So there's a lot of different
things to think as we move

758
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,700
from language to personality,
but it's turning out to be

759
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,810
surprisingly hard on some
dimensions to show an

760
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:30,610
influence of parental
environment on child

761
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:31,730
development, especially
in personality.

762
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:32,548
Yeah.

763
00:30:32,548 --> 00:30:35,964
AUDIENCE: So, first off, for
the adopted sibling thing.

764
00:30:35,964 --> 00:30:39,380
It seems like that way, not only
would they get similar

765
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,308
parental environment, but they
also probably have similar

766
00:30:42,308 --> 00:30:43,290
school environment--

767
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:43,690
PROFESSOR: Oh, yes.

768
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:45,710
It's worse than that.

769
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,810
This is a very good question.

770
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:49,120
It's not only that they have
adoptive parents, if they have

771
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,780
another kid in the house,
there's another kid in the

772
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,590
house, they probably go to the
same-- if they go to church or

773
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:57,150
synagogue or anything
like that.

774
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:02,680
Same school, same state, same
influence of whoever's the NBA

775
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,870
basketball champion.

776
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:05,770
The whole list.

777
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,290
And it seems to be--

778
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:09,206
you can't identify
anything in that.

779
00:31:09,206 --> 00:31:10,870
Yeah?

780
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:16,226
AUDIENCE: Something that is
biological but not in DNA,

781
00:31:16,226 --> 00:31:17,710
that is also 50-50?

782
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,260
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

783
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,330
So diet would influence that.

784
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:22,782
Who knows?

785
00:31:22,782 --> 00:31:24,856
AUDIENCE: Stuff like you're born
with, so that it's not

786
00:31:24,856 --> 00:31:27,662
just as an environmental thing,
but it's not, strictly

787
00:31:27,662 --> 00:31:29,630
speaking, in your DNA.

788
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:32,150
Because that's what
identical twins--

789
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:34,630
PROFESSOR: Well, let me stop
you there for one moment.

790
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:37,770
I think at some level of
analysis, all environmental

791
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:38,290
influences--

792
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:40,580
education, parenting,
everything--

793
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:44,410
will have a biological
counterpart in your body and

794
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:46,360
in your brain, right?

795
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,280
Because the environment has to
affect you by how it changes

796
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,630
your body or brain.

797
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:52,540
After you're born.

798
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,310
It could be added in.

799
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,010
There's things--

800
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:57,370
methylation, there's a lot--
yeah, it could be all those

801
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:01,680
things, but who's
driving that?

802
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,390
So it's not--

803
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:05,370
my bet is that we'll discover
stuff about this that

804
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:07,280
we don't grasp yet.

805
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,600
The answer is not going to be
parenting makes no difference,

806
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,580
or environments make no
difference, or schools make no

807
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,340
difference, for personality.

808
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,610
But we just don't know how to
think about that yet is the

809
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,870
best guess, because it's
just hard to believe.

810
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:20,512
Yeah.

811
00:32:20,512 --> 00:32:23,450
AUDIENCE: Is there a correlation
between IQ and any

812
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:24,580
kind of personality?

813
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,030
PROFESSOR: IQ and personality?

814
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,655
There is a moderate--

815
00:32:27,655 --> 00:32:29,460
of conscientiousness
especially,

816
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,490
but that makes sense.

817
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,110
On average--

818
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:35,650
and we certainly know people
who are very smart and very

819
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:39,430
sloppy, but on average, the more
conscientious you are,

820
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,580
like if you go to school, you
do your homework, that kinds

821
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,385
of stuff, there is a positive
correlation.

822
00:32:43,385 --> 00:32:46,630

823
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,640
So there's all kinds of--
one question is how much

824
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,880
personality is fixing
your environment.

825
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,100
So how much is the way you are,
from the moment you're

826
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,000
born, driving actually the way
the teacher responds to you in

827
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,820
school, the way the parent
responds to you?

828
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:01,310
And so that's why your
personality's already driving

829
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,760
your actual environment.

830
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,070
Because we could say, well,
you're in a school, but

831
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,952
really, do you like the
teacher, do you

832
00:33:06,952 --> 00:33:07,810
not like the teacher?

833
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,020
Do you like your parents?

834
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,820
Do you follow them?

835
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,100
Do you oppose them?

836
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,830
Maybe those kinds of things
are happening.

837
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:18,240
Sometimes people think that your
personality is driving

838
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,010
the way your environment
responds to you.

839
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:23,480
It might be done by
sibling contrast.

840
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,070
So you may have this
experience that--

841
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:28,740

842
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,990
parents and other people and
siblings yourself often think

843
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:34,140
a fair bit how they are similar
or dissimilar from

844
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,570
their own sibling, and
they might overdo it.

845
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:39,410
Because a parent has two kids,
one kid's like 1% more

846
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:43,060
outgoing, and they go, that's
the outgoing one.

847
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:46,380
One kid plays 5% more time on
the piano, and they go, oh,

848
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,480
she's the real musician.

849
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,920
And because he plays two more
baseball games a year, he's

850
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,020
the athlete.

851
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:54,580
And then it starts to snowball
that way, OK?

852
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,800
Or parent identification.

853
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,060
Could kids who identify with
one parent or the other,

854
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,770
again, by their predispositions,
sort of be

855
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:03,500
driving the way their parents
interact with them in a way

856
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,130
that's, again, driven
by the personality?

857
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:06,070
The personality--

858
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:08,370
from the first moment, for
one reason or another--

859
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:11,120
is molding the environment
around it and carrying the

860
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,179
environmental effect as well.

861
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:17,310
So one of the giant fights in
all of psychology is this.

862
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,435
And there's not going to
be an answer, I'll just

863
00:34:18,435 --> 00:34:20,550
tell you the debate.

864
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:23,020
And it's at the core of this
question of why do we do the

865
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,000
things we do.

866
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,949
So personality adjusted
psychologists will say, it's

867
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:28,500
these things we've
just discussed.

868
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,179
It's our predispositions to like
things and not like other

869
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:33,880
things in a general way
are personality.

870
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,960
Social psychologists--

871
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,440
and we'll spend two lectures in
just a few weeks on social

872
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,969
psychology--

873
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:41,730
say people are all
kind of the same.

874
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:45,870
It's all about the social
situation we're in.

875
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:48,350
Probably it's like one of these
nature-nurture things.

876
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,270
Probably something about the
situation is something about

877
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,969
who you are.

878
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:56,520
But let me tell you how some of
this debate is played out.

879
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:01,130
So a famous study that went
against the idea of a

880
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:04,890
personality being constant
across situations and time

881
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:06,530
came from Walter Mischel.

882
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,020
And they looked at
conscientiousness.

883
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,710
And they said, OK, some kids
score high or low or medium on

884
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,140
conscientiousness.

885
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:16,850
Now, let's look at 19 specific
behaviors in their life.

886
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:19,170
Not their report of how they
are, or their parents' report

887
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:21,590
of how they are, but things they
do that we can measure.

888
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,830
How often do they
make their bed?

889
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,410
How often do they go to class
like they should?

890
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:26,430
How often do they complete their
homework assignments?

891
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,910
How often do they have
good class notes

892
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:29,730
when they leave classes?

893
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:33,310
So things you can check,
yes or no.

894
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:37,190
And they said gee, what we
notice is somebody tends to be

895
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:39,310
pretty consistent about whether
they make their bed or

896
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:41,020
not every morning-- not
perfect, but pretty

897
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,150
consistent.

898
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:44,900
But that same person may or
may not be so good at

899
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,150
completing homework
assignments.

900
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:48,520

901
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,430
And that person that's very
consistent on completing

902
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,920
homework assignments may or may
not be so good on having

903
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,020
neat class notes.

904
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:59,590
So it's not that people aren't
consistent, but it's far more

905
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,070
specific about what they're
consistent about than a big

906
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:04,910
personality dimension that
covers a range of things that

907
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:05,810
ought to go together.

908
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:07,150
So this is situationism.

909
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:10,290
You behave in a certain way
in a certain situation.

910
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:12,200
It's not like you have a
personality that moves from

911
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,300
situation to situation and
predicts the same behavior.

912
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,310
And here's another example of
how they follow kids in a

913
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:21,890
summer camp, and here's
different behaviors from one

914
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:23,280
child to another child.

915
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,310
So this is a child who, when a
peer approaches, how verbally

916
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:29,600
aggressive they are.

917
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,180
And so, aggression
is high this way.

918
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,320
These are different
situations.

919
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,160
And you can see for one child
they're aggressive in this

920
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,570
situation when they deal with
an adult, and in this

921
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:39,530
situation this other child is
aggressive when he or she

922
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,220
deals with a peer.

923
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,880
So if you were to say there's
an aggressive thing about

924
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,710
people-- they're aggressive or
they're not-- well, this

925
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,890
person's aggressive with a
peer, and this person is

926
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:51,070
aggressive specifically
with an adult.

927
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:53,430
And so is aggressiveness
a personality thing?

928
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:56,430
Or situation by situation
by situation?

929
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:58,100
In the movies you see
all the time--

930
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,920
if you watch The Sopranos or
many movies, it's not uncommon

931
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,590
to have the crime figure be
really kind of nice with his

932
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:10,450
family, and really brutal with
a competing criminal gang.

933
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:10,600
Right?

934
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,350
Have you seen that?

935
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,330
They're kind of nice at home,
and then they go shoot people

936
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:17,350
on two seconds notice
if they're

937
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,220
fighting about something.

938
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,700
So you see that kind
of an idea.

939
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:24,010

940
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:27,510
Another thing that people have
looked at that's related to

941
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,760
personality is temperament.

942
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,560

943
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,190
So it's an innate, biologically
based propensity

944
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,900
to engage in a certain
style of behavior.

945
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,050
It's broader than a trait.

946
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:39,230
I'll describe one that's been
well studied, but people like

947
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,540
it because they think
it's observable.

948
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:43,720
So with traits, it's hard to
just look at you and say

949
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,430
you're extroverted or you're
conscientious.

950
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,020
I could follow you around
all day and

951
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,690
maybe have an estimate.

952
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:52,830
But here, temperaments are
broader than traits, and you

953
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:56,050
can see it in terms of
people's sociability,

954
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,680
emotionality and
activity level.

955
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,460
You can just follow
them and see them

956
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,260
behave in certain ways.

957
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,910
So let's think about the
temperament of shyness.

958
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:06,350
So the way these studies were
done at Harvard was that some

959
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,240
babies, even at six weeks,
are more reactive

960
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,150
to make sudden noises.

961
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,410
They're more fussy.

962
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:12,620
About 20% of children
could be that way.

963
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,925
They make a noise or something
and they cry, they get

964
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:16,650
disturbed, they're unhappy.

965
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:19,870
And so he called those children
high-reactive or

966
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,610
inhibited babies.

967
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:23,120
They use those two terms
for the same

968
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,540
idea, versus low reactive.

969
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,770
Ones who were very disturbed by
the environment, and ones

970
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:29,800
who were, like, no big deal.

971
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,770
And the ones who were inhibited
babies cried more,

972
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,870
they were distressed more, they
showed more activity,

973
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:38,110
faster heart rates, higher
levels of cortisol.

974
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,720
And they even have-- they could
measure this in some

975
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,440
cases-- faster heart rates
in the womb, even

976
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,790
before they were born.

977
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:43,820
Their hearts were racing.

978
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,750
So all they'd need is that
one last little thing.

979
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,680
And the idea is that maybe
their sympathetic nervous

980
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,360
system is easily aroused,
seeks less arousing

981
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,170
situations, and it's inhibited
because they're already

982
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:56,700
internally so aroused,
they want calm.

983
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,200
So there's going to be a
surprise in this story.

984
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,830
But as you go, in terms of
thinking about shyness, and

985
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:04,780
you can measure these at two
months or four months with

986
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,660
these very simple little things
you do with babies to

987
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,020
see how they respond
to some noise.

988
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:11,580
And to a decent extent, it
predicts shyness in later

989
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,140
childhood and adulthood.

990
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,780
About a quarter of the children
who look pretty

991
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:19,990
inhibited aren't shy, but about
75% who look pretty

992
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,480
inhibited end up shy.

993
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,230
So that's a pretty good
prediction from a

994
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,290
two-month-old to
a young adult.

995
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:27,330
About 75% of these
children who look

996
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:29,800
pretty shy at two months--

997
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,440
and of course, they're not shy
in a group, they're just

998
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,970
responding to noises--

999
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:35,040
end up being kind of
shy as adults.

1000
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,740

1001
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:44,000
And they studied these until age
21, and again, in several

1002
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,530
outcomes, specifically things
like-- let's pick one--

1003
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,240
crime, how often they
get in crime.

1004
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,270
Children who are well controlled
don't get so much

1005
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:54,740
into crime.

1006
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:59,410
Children who at 21 had poor
control at age three are more

1007
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:00,650
likely to get into trouble.

1008
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:04,130
So as if these temperament
factors in early, early

1009
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:07,420
childhood are already risk
factors for doing better or

1010
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:10,610
worse in the world.

1011
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:14,320
Another one that people enjoy
studying is sensation seeking.

1012
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,130
You know, the bungee jumpers,
the people who like to

1013
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:20,770
parachute, people who enjoy
the thrill of activities,

1014
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:23,160
novel, high-stimulation
situations.

1015
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,920
Statistically they have more
fun, probably, in some ways.

1016
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,070
They're more likely to dive,
they're more likely to drive

1017
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:31,100
fast, they're more likely to
have drug or alcohol use,

1018
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,900
they're more likely to send
flame emails, listen to punk

1019
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,260
music, and have driving
accidents.

1020
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:38,460
So it's an interesting mix
of enjoyment and trouble.

1021
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,540
And there's some evidence they
have lower levels of something

1022
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:44,740
in the blood that may be a
measure of something that lets

1023
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:47,710
dopamine last longer in the
synapse in your brain.

1024
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:50,800
Dopamine is the reward
neurotransmitter.

1025
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,330
So you could imagine that if
the reward hangs around

1026
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:56,820
longer, maybe you're more
drawn towards instantly

1027
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:59,750
rewarding things.

1028
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:04,745
Another sort of, I think,
two-dimensional classification

1029
00:41:04,745 --> 00:41:06,060
of personality.

1030
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,790
Again, one dimension that
he focused on was this

1031
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:11,620
introversion to extroversion
or stable to unstable.

1032
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,600
This is neuroticism or
introversion/extroversion in

1033
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,280
the big five.

1034
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,220
But there's some interesting
turns on this.

1035
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,160
Here's the interesting turn.

1036
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,380
I mentioned it, but let me
tell you one more time,

1037
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,250
because it's counter-intuitive.

1038
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,120
It's the opposite of what you
think in terms of what people

1039
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,390
have found.

1040
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:27,860
So we think of extroverts as
people who go to parties, are

1041
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,620
very talkative, very outgoing,
run around and have a social

1042
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:33,390
time, and introverts as more
likely to be shy, quiet,

1043
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:33,940
withdrawn, right?

1044
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:36,920
That's the definitions
of the words.

1045
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,495
But what people have found in
a variety of studies is that

1046
00:41:39,495 --> 00:41:40,310
extroverts-- the outgoing
people--

1047
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:42,710
are less easily aroused.

1048
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,020
So it's as if they
seek stimulation.

1049
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:48,110
It's as if their internal
arousal is low, and they want

1050
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:50,280
things that are stimulating in
their environment to push up

1051
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,400
their internal arousal, right?

1052
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,170
Introverts are the
opposite around.

1053
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:57,460
Introverts are aroused already,
and it's as if they

1054
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:00,780
seek environments that are
quiet, so their arousal is not

1055
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,820
pushed above some level
of discomfort.

1056
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,120
So intuitively you might think
extroverts are more aroused

1057
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:10,530
internally, but the thought is
that extroverts are actually

1058
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:14,170
seeking arousal because they're
a little lower inside.

1059
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:16,800
Introverts are already feeling
pretty aroused, so they don't

1060
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,630
need more bungee jumping.

1061
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:22,690
They're already feeling like
they're bungee jumping, OK?

1062
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:24,760
So then they're all seeking
this sort of

1063
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,260
optimal level of arousal.

1064
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,070
So, for example, extroverts do
better in noisy settings, they

1065
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:32,900
can take the extra stuff,
they don't mind it.

1066
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,820
Introverts are more sensitive
to pain, and they salivate

1067
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:36,700
more to lemon juice.

1068
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:41,570
They're already kind of revved
up, is the story, internally.

1069
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:43,730
So here's one--

1070
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:46,560
we couldn't do this early in
the course, and this almost

1071
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,420
has practical concept--

1072
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,040
you could think about this
for your own test taking.

1073
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,025
A three-way interaction.

1074
00:42:53,025 --> 00:42:55,690
This is three factors that all
interact with one another in

1075
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:58,790
performance, and it involves
situation and personality.

1076
00:42:58,790 --> 00:42:59,970
So here we go.

1077
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:01,840
So the three factors are whether
you're introverted or

1078
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:05,540
extroverted, whether you're
taking a test-- a GRE kind of

1079
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:08,610
a test-- in the morning or the
afternoon, and whether you

1080
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:11,390
drank a cup of coffee before
the test or not.

1081
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:14,160
Three different things
floating around.

1082
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,010
And here's what people have
found several times in

1083
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,920
experiments when you're
taking a test.

1084
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,840
Here's the upshot
of the studies.

1085
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:25,180
If you're introverted and the
test is in the late afternoon

1086
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:27,210
or evening, drink coffee.

1087
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:30,230
If you're outgoing, drink
coffee in the morning.

1088
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:32,820
And I'll tell you the
logic of this.

1089
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:35,500
All right?

1090
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,140
So here's the idea.

1091
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,190
Many studies have shown-- and
you may know this, if you

1092
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:41,250
think about people you
know or yourself.

1093
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:43,630
On average, introverts are most
aroused in the morning.

1094
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:45,240
They tend to be get up early in
the morning and get their

1095
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,430
day going people.

1096
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:48,310
Maybe because they didn't
party deep into

1097
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:50,400
the previous night.

1098
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,345
There's cause and effect that's
really hard to pull out

1099
00:43:52,345 --> 00:43:54,520
in all of this.

1100
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,340
But introverts are more aroused
in the morning and

1101
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,620
less in the evening.

1102
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,206
On average, they're the kind of
people who are get up early

1103
00:43:59,206 --> 00:44:00,500
in the morning, go
do their stuff.

1104
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,450
In the evening they want to
mellow down and maybe not go

1105
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:04,450
to sleep so late.

1106
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:06,590
Extroverts are more aroused
in the evening,

1107
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:07,810
and less in the morning.

1108
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:09,300
And this is on average,
and this has been

1109
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,650
found a number of times.

1110
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:13,050
So again, you can imagine if
you're taking a test, if

1111
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:16,040
you're under-aroused,
you could use the

1112
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,070
coffee to perk you up.

1113
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:18,830
If you're over-aroused, the
coffee is going to make you

1114
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:20,470
jittery and push you over.

1115
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:22,260
So depending on the time of day,
you're going to be in one

1116
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,430
state or the other depending
on the kind of

1117
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:24,190
personality you have.

1118
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:24,710
Does that make sense?

1119
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:28,070
These three things come together
like that in the

1120
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:30,660
famous Yerkes-Dodson Law of
performance, which is this.

1121
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:33,030
And this is observed
in many years.

1122
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:34,830
Here's arousal, how
aroused you are.

1123
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:39,030
Super aroused, super nervous,
shaky, so sleepy you're about

1124
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:41,110
to crash out.

1125
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:42,540
Somewhere in the middle
usually goes with best

1126
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:46,130
performance, because
this is too much,

1127
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:46,950
and this is too little.

1128
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:47,630
You know that.

1129
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:49,900
If you're too nervous, you don't
tend to perform well.

1130
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,760
If you're too kind of out of
it, you don't perform well.

1131
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,830
Somewhere in the middle
is just right.

1132
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:58,690
So here's extroverts,
for example.

1133
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:02,460
In the morning, they're pretty
low on this, they could use

1134
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,860
some coffee to move
to optimal.

1135
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,976
Here's introverts in the
morning, they're already ready

1136
00:45:06,976 --> 00:45:08,720
to go, I'm ready to go,
I'm ready to go.

1137
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,820
The last thing they need
is more coffee.

1138
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:14,520
I hope it's not a bubble test
because my hands are shaking.

1139
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,050
OK?

1140
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:17,490
So three things.

1141
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:20,450
The kind of personality you
are, the time of day, and

1142
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:22,920
whether your drinking coffee
helps you to move to this

1143
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,880
middle position or not.

1144
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,420
Does that makes sense?

1145
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:27,760
So that's three different
factors sort of adding up to

1146
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,120
optimize performance or not.

1147
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,390
OK, lastly I'd like to talk a
little bit about some things

1148
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:37,400
we know about brain correlates
of personality.

1149
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:42,480
And in some areas, these brain
things are more informative at

1150
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,490
a broad level.

1151
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,420
Because sometimes people will
say, well, personality is all

1152
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:46,900
this check box stuff.

1153
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,830
Is it even relevant to
anything biological?

1154
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:50,900
Now, if it's relevant
to behavior,

1155
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,370
it's relevant to biology.

1156
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:56,140
Behavior is biology, or
biology is behavior.

1157
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:57,650
We're not going to get one
relative to the other.

1158
00:45:57,650 --> 00:46:00,490
But still, until recently,
people couldn't measure this.

1159
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:01,780
So these are pictures of--

1160
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:04,530
not of brain functions, of a
task turning on-- we'll see

1161
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:05,920
pictures of those in a moment.

1162
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,510
This is measurement of
brain structure.

1163
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:11,880
Measurement of brain
structure.

1164
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,470
And specifically, thickness
of cortex.

1165
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:17,920
So what you're seeing is a
statistic here, which is, the

1166
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,710
more extroverted you are, the
thicker your cortex is here.

1167
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:23,740
The more conscientious, the
thicker your cortex here.

1168
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:28,700
The more neurotic, the thicker
your cortex here, and so on.

1169
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:31,720
So we don't understand these
deeply, but we do see

1170
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:34,130
physically measurable
correlates of these

1171
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:36,250
personality dimensions.

1172
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:38,500
So that's physical
brain structure.

1173
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,090
Let's talk about some
function things.

1174
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:44,370
This is a slide you saw before
that in the amygdala, the more

1175
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:46,960
emotionally intense something
is, the more the response.

1176
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,890
The more neutral it is,
the less the response.

1177
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:53,170
Here's a positive happy
picture, right?

1178
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:54,140
I'm going to show you
a neutral picture.

1179
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,140
I'm going to show you
now the bad picture.

1180
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:57,470
Don't look if you don't
want to see it again.

1181
00:46:57,470 --> 00:46:58,260
It's the one you saw before.

1182
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,250
Close your eyes for a moment.

1183
00:46:59,250 --> 00:46:59,850
Bad picture.

1184
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:00,010
OK.

1185
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:00,580
Here we go.

1186
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:01,940
Now you can all look.

1187
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:04,990
So people are introverted
or extroverted.

1188
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:07,560
Extroverts are sociable,
talkative.

1189
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:11,020
Introverts are, on average,
more reserved or quiet.

1190
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:14,150
Extroverts report more positive
experiences, more

1191
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:16,120
susceptible to positive
mood induction.

1192
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,440
Lots of evidence for some
differences among them.

1193
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,520
So imagine a study where you
show people positive and

1194
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,320
negative slides.

1195
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:24,510
Again, people will say, well,
if I'm on a diet, this is

1196
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:28,230
really negative, or something.

1197
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:29,090
You have people rate them.

1198
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:30,760
But on average these are
negative, and on average these

1199
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,790
are positive.

1200
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:36,120
You measure their personality,
and here's what you find in

1201
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,370
the amygdala.

1202
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:39,170

1203
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:43,590
The more extroverted they are,
the more their amygdala

1204
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:46,060
responds to positive things.

1205
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:48,480
The more introverted they are,
the more it responds to

1206
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,830
negative things.

1207
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:53,390
So here's exactly what we mean
by personality sort of

1208
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:54,220
instantiated in one example.

1209
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:55,990
And it's not the only example.

1210
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:57,030
What do we mean by
personality?

1211
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:59,370
We mean there's a constant
situation--

1212
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:01,760
let's pretend a party
you go to.

1213
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,090
A party deep in my memory.

1214
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:05,310
I remember parties I went to,
the music is playing, and

1215
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:07,930
there's sticky beer on the
floor, and there's people you

1216
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:09,590
know and a lot of people
you don't know, right?

1217
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:12,810
So who walks in the door and
thinks this is awesome?

1218
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:14,230
The extrovert, right?

1219
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:17,240
Who walks in the door and thinks
why did my friend drag

1220
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:17,720
me to this?

1221
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,500
I could be doing something
good like chess at home.

1222
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,090

1223
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:26,270
So now, identical situation,
different-- but that's true of

1224
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:27,970
so many things and preferences
in life.

1225
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:29,950
That's almost what we mean
by personality, right?

1226
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:31,750
Who likes what?

1227
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:34,020
Situations, people,
activities.

1228
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:38,230
So for extroversion, here's the
amygdala going, positive

1229
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:39,410
things, whoopee!

1230
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:42,620
They notice, so to speak, in
their amygdala the positivity

1231
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:43,210
of the environment.

1232
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:45,250
They're drawn to things because
they see positive.

1233
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:47,850
Here is the introverts going,
danger, danger.

1234
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:48,570
OK?

1235
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:51,030
Everybody sees the same set of
slides, but people are drawn

1236
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:53,580
to the positive or the negative
aspects of this.

1237
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:54,850
And you could say, is one
better, the other worse?

1238
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:55,710
Well, no.

1239
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:58,110
Avoiding dangerous things
is a good idea.

1240
00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:00,130
Enjoying positive things
is a good idea.

1241
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:01,830
One is not better
than the other.

1242
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:02,850
They're just different.

1243
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:05,570
You're tuned to different
rewards in life.

1244
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:07,490
And this is one example
of that.

1245
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:09,440
How about a smiling face?

1246
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,610
Who thinks a smiling face is an
invitation to go over and

1247
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:13,290
meet somebody new?

1248
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:15,760
The introvert or
the extrovert?

1249
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,646
Help me on this.

1250
00:49:16,646 --> 00:49:18,820
Who thinks the smiling
face is pressure?

1251
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:19,770
Do I go over?

1252
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:21,020
Are they smiling at me?

1253
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:23,696

1254
00:49:23,696 --> 00:49:25,450
Or I'm going to go over
and then they're

1255
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:26,700
not gonna like me.

1256
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,260
They like me now, right?

1257
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:31,220
I should tell you,
I was quite--

1258
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:33,920
only in my teaching mode do
I appear extroverted, OK?

1259
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,310
But I definitely was
an introvert in

1260
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:36,550
high school and college.

1261
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:38,080
So if I make fun of
introverts, I'm

1262
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,820
making fun of myself.

1263
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:43,970
So here's a response
to fearful faces.

1264
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:45,910
And we talked about that
before, response in the

1265
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:48,040
amygdala regardless
of personality.

1266
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,700
But now when we talk about the
response in the amygdala for

1267
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:55,070
happy faces, big response if
you're extroverted, little

1268
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:56,790
response if you're
introverted.

1269
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:59,630
Because a happy face is like
compelling, cool, wonderful

1270
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:04,780
for the extrovert, and not as
enticing for the introvert.

1271
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:07,670
So again, the way we might
imagine, how do individual

1272
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:08,980
differences in personality
play out?

1273
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:12,130
They play out that some things
are beguiling, wonderful, and

1274
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:13,070
other things not so much.

1275
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:15,652
And depending on your
personality, that can vary.

1276
00:50:15,652 --> 00:50:19,350

1277
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:22,620
So these are the children who
were studied from the ages of

1278
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:29,130
two and four months who were
shy in temperament,

1279
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:30,700
inhibited, in orange.

1280
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:33,035
And they compared them to
the most uninhibited.

1281
00:50:33,035 --> 00:50:34,680
They take the extremes.

1282
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,950
But it's a very rare thing when
you have a behavioral

1283
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:40,770
assessment of a child in their
infancy, and then you brain

1284
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:44,950
image them about 20 years later
when they're grown up.

1285
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:48,440
So now you're making this 20
years of your life story, and

1286
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:51,380
again in the amygdala, what
they find is this.

1287
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:56,080
If you look at the people who
are uninhibited, here's a

1288
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,570
novel face they see for the
first time in the scanner, or

1289
00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:00,440
a face they've seen many times,
and there's not much

1290
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,770
difference.

1291
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:03,380
For the people who are
inhibited, you see a much

1292
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:05,990
bigger amygdala response
to the novel face.

1293
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:08,130
Well, this is exactly what you
might intuitively think

1294
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:09,930
shyness would be about.

1295
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:12,490
If you're a shy person and you
know somebody well, I think a

1296
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:14,440
lot of shyness disappears.

1297
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:17,460
But where shyness shows the most
is a face that you don't

1298
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:20,560
know, a new person you haven't
met, and maybe you're not so

1299
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,290
comfortable with them yet.

1300
00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:25,300
So this is exactly the pattern
you might expect, that it

1301
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,470
doesn't matter too much for an
extrovert, a new face, a

1302
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:28,910
familiar face--

1303
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:30,635
made familiar in the experiment,
not somebody you

1304
00:51:30,635 --> 00:51:31,470
really know--

1305
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:33,230
it doesn't make much
of a difference.

1306
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:35,825
For the person who is inhibited,
much more response

1307
00:51:35,825 --> 00:51:38,585
to the face they see for the
first time only, as opposed to

1308
00:51:38,585 --> 00:51:42,275
a face they've grown
familiar with.

1309
00:51:42,275 --> 00:51:45,130
A couple more examples
along this line.

1310
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:46,010
Here's another scale.

1311
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:47,550
There's an infinite
number of them.

1312
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:50,340
The Spielberger State and Trait
Anxiety, so, state and

1313
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:50,980
trait, right?

1314
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:53,720
So they ask you-- this is just
a reminder of that--

1315
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:54,750
how do you feel right now?

1316
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:55,520
That would be your state.

1317
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,210
Right now.

1318
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:57,280
Do I feel at ease?

1319
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,400
Do I feel upset?

1320
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,770
And in general, how do you
feel, at ease or upset?

1321
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:04,100
So this is day in day out,
this is right now.

1322
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:07,200
We're going to focus on the
trait, how you say you feel

1323
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,810
day in, day out.

1324
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:12,630
And now they're going to show
you faces of people who are

1325
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:17,020
shown in full view, or who are
shown in a subliminal masked

1326
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:19,000
version where a fear or neutral
face is followed by

1327
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:19,730
another face.

1328
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:21,010
This is the critical face.

1329
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:24,060
So you see a face that you see
pretty well, or you see a face

1330
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:26,310
that's presented under
circumstances where you can't

1331
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,820
tell what the face was.

1332
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:29,880
OK?

1333
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,210
At first they say, what happens
if we show you the

1334
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:34,720
regular face that you
see perfectly well?

1335
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,850
Nothing makes much
of a difference.

1336
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:37,550
Here's the amygdala response
to fearful face.

1337
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:39,980
You've seen this now
multiple times.

1338
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:42,620
But kind of interestingly, you
get a smaller response in the

1339
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:46,600
amygdala, and it's driven by
how anxious you report

1340
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,150
yourself to be on
a regular basis.

1341
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:51,630
So the interpretation is this.

1342
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:53,930
If you see a fearful face, you
go, well, it's a fearful face,

1343
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:56,620
I know it's a fearful phase,
we're all the same.

1344
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:59,190
If you subliminally present
it, you have an

1345
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:02,080
unknown source of danger.

1346
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:07,030
What we intuitively imagine
anxiety is is feeling danger

1347
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:10,600
or threat in your environment
more than is helpful, more

1348
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:11,950
than is comfortable.

1349
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:12,700
OK?

1350
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:14,330
And you don't even
know exactly why.

1351
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:16,040
It's not entirely rational
when you're

1352
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,790
anxious in that way.

1353
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:20,350
And so what happens is, the more
anxious you are, the more

1354
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:24,120
these subliminal faces drive an
amygdala response, and you

1355
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:26,010
don't have control over that,
because you don't know what

1356
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:27,910
happened, because it was
subliminally presented.

1357
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:29,040
Does that make sense?

1358
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,340
When it's clear, everybody
knows what to do.

1359
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:33,740
It's just a face and
not that scary.

1360
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:36,630
But when it's an unknown source
of a bit of unease, the

1361
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,430
more chronically anxious you
are, the more the brain's

1362
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:39,910
responding.

1363
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:42,420
Or we might say, the bigger
the brain response is the

1364
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:47,270
basis, perhaps, of the
chronic unease.

1365
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:49,710
So we talked also before about
the amygdala being important

1366
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:53,050
for recognizing fearful
expressions.

1367
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:56,340
And then I want to share
two last examples.

1368
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:57,800
How about genetic influences?

1369
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,280
So we know genes are a big part
of the story, but how big

1370
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:00,970
a part of the story?

1371
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:02,840
So again, we talked about
single nucleotide

1372
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:06,330
polymorphisms, common
genetic variance.

1373
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:08,450
And here's one that involves
a serotonin

1374
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:10,830
transporter in the amygdala.

1375
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:15,380
There's a short or long allele,
so we'll have two of

1376
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:16,660
these, all of us.

1377
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:19,650
The short allele is
weakly correlated

1378
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:20,930
with anxiety traits.

1379
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:23,890
All this genetic stuff is pretty
weak at the moment, for

1380
00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:25,830
reasons that are not
well understood.

1381
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:27,630
I'm only presenting you ones
that have been at least

1382
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:28,780
replicated once.

1383
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:31,070
But practically every genetic
example I'm going to show you,

1384
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:33,190
there's been non-confirmations
as well.

1385
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:34,740
We don't know why this is.

1386
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:37,410
The genes are just so far away
from complex human behaviors

1387
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:38,950
is probably the answer.

1388
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:41,710
But what has been replicated
a number of times is this.

1389
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:45,200
If they show you fearful faces,
and you have the short

1390
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,160
allele, the one that's slightly
associated with

1391
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,145
anxiety, this is the difference
between people with

1392
00:54:50,145 --> 00:54:51,730
the long allele and the shorter
allele, a much more

1393
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:54,910
powerful response to fearful
faces if you

1394
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:55,790
have the shorter allele.

1395
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:58,470
So a single gene can be
correlated with a more potent

1396
00:54:58,470 --> 00:55:01,060
response to a sort of
threat stimulus.

1397
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:03,550
And again, that goes with our
sense of anxiety, and what we

1398
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,610
might call a less than desirable
response to threat

1399
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:08,810
in the environment.

1400
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:12,410
So here's the last two slides.

1401
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:17,430
But it's the dream we all have
in understanding people, and

1402
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:19,470
actually all animals on the
face of this planet, but

1403
00:55:19,470 --> 00:55:22,120
people most of all if you're
curious about people, which

1404
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:25,380
is, what is the interaction
between the genes we're born

1405
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:27,730
with and the life we lead,
and how does that end up

1406
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:29,480
with us being us?

1407
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,950
And it's incredibly hard to
study that, because everybody

1408
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:37,350
says in biology and
neuroscience, we know it's a

1409
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:39,780
gene by experience
interaction.

1410
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:43,020
The genes will make you strong
in some circumstances and

1411
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,850
vulnerable in others.

1412
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:46,530
But it's very hard
to specify that.

1413
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:48,590
The genes have been
hard to identify.

1414
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:50,610
And we can't put people
into experiments.

1415
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:53,340
We can't say, we'll take two
identical twins and we'll put

1416
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:56,290
one into some horrible household
full of stress and

1417
00:55:56,290 --> 00:55:58,720
horribleness, and then one into
a delightful household,

1418
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,730
and then see them at 20
and see what happened.

1419
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:01,210
OK?

1420
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:02,440
We're just not allowed
to do that, right?

1421
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:06,620
So we can't experiment on the
environment, and the genes are

1422
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:11,040
poorly understood, very poorly
understood, in relation to

1423
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,850
basic human behaviors.

1424
00:56:12,850 --> 00:56:15,630
But there's a study from Caspi
that is a glimpse of where we

1425
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:16,730
think the field might
be going.

1426
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:19,200
But I'm going to warn you that
this has not always been

1427
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,520
replicated.

1428
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,150
It's been replicated sometimes,

1429
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:22,940
but not other times.

1430
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:26,700
So it's an asterisk, but it's
still a finding that's really

1431
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:29,790
quite striking, if it turns
out to be roughly correct.

1432
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:32,800
So again, this is polymorphism
of the same gene that's

1433
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,880
associated with anxiety.

1434
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,870
And what they did in a very
large sample in New Zealand

1435
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:46,040
was catalog stressful life
events ages 21 to 26, job,

1436
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:48,820
whether you have a job or not,
your salary, decent housing,

1437
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:50,950
terrible housing, good health,
bad health, happy

1438
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:52,830
relationships, no relationships,
terrible

1439
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:53,480
relationships.

1440
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,940
People are filling out forms
telling you about the stresses

1441
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:57,530
in their life.

1442
00:56:57,530 --> 00:57:00,830
And then they also have
information about childhood

1443
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:01,380
maltreatment.

1444
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:04,700
Some of these children, very
sadly, when they were younger

1445
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:07,080
were treated very poorly, they
were abused in some way or

1446
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:10,610
another, were in very terrible
circumstances, and some not.

1447
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:12,920
So they're going to look at
stressful events in childhood

1448
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:18,350
and adulthood, and sort them
out by the allele that the

1449
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:21,720
individuals have, the gene
version, and what they find

1450
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,360
is-- and I'll show you the
graph in a moment--

1451
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,680
more depression and suicidality
in response to

1452
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:29,310
stressful events if you have a
short version of the allele.

1453
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:31,650
The short version, we just said,
is the one that seems to

1454
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:35,025
drive a bigger anxiety response
to fearful faces in

1455
00:57:35,025 --> 00:57:36,220
the amygdala, OK?

1456
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:40,570
So it seems, first pass, to be
a gene that's associated with

1457
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:45,120
responding in a more anxious way
to environmental stress,

1458
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,810
threat, and bad things.

1459
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:49,010
So here's a couple of graphs.

1460
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:50,430
I'll just do a couple
with you.

1461
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:55,170
Here's the probability of major
depression if you've had

1462
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:59,130
no maltreatment as a child, if
you've probably had some, or

1463
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:02,650
you've had documented horrible
maltreatment as a child.

1464
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:04,920
And what you can see if you have
the long version-- this

1465
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,070
is this line here--

1466
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:09,610
the long version of this
allele, no difference.

1467
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:14,910
It's as if if you happen to be
born in the biological lottery

1468
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:18,920
that we all participate in at
birth with these version of

1469
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,140
these genes-- and maybe many
other genes that are part of

1470
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,890
this story, but they just
measured this one.

1471
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:27,610
That it doesn't matter whether
you live in a nice supportive

1472
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:30,970
environment or a brutalizing,
horrible one, your probability

1473
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:32,800
of depression is
about the same.

1474
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:36,560
It's a protective gene for
stresses of life that are

1475
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:37,900
visited upon you.

1476
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:42,070
If you have the opposite,
the short version, look.

1477
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:44,840
The worse the environment, you
double your chances of

1478
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,230
depression.

1479
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:50,660
It's as if you're born with a
gene that, if you're given a

1480
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:51,910
terrible environment--

1481
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:54,200
this is exactly the interaction,
right--

1482
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:57,090
then you're very susceptible
to that.

1483
00:58:57,090 --> 00:59:01,540
And you see the same rough
pattern in all of them, that

1484
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:05,310
individuals who have this
version of the gene seem to be

1485
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:09,520
relatively impervious to
environmental stressors.

1486
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,800
The ones born with this version
of the gene are

1487
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,310
terribly-- so if this person's
born with this version of the

1488
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:15,880
gene, but happens to be
in a nice supportive

1489
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,550
household, no problem.

1490
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:19,010
Right?

1491
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:21,870
But if they happen to be born
into a household where they

1492
00:59:21,870 --> 00:59:26,200
experience, sadly, severe
maltreatment, big problem.

1493
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,300
And so this is exactly what we
imagine if we understood in

1494
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:32,100
any depth what people are
about, the genetic

1495
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:34,600
potentiations you're born with,
what's easy for you or

1496
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,640
hard for you by genes.

1497
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,380
And the world your handed as
an infant, not under your

1498
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:41,600
control, but the environment
you're given, supportive or

1499
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:45,480
threatening, how those two
things play out in a sort of

1500
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:50,640
duet, making you safe or
putting you at risk.

1501
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,320
That's exactly what would--
then we would deeply

1502
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:57,190
understand the biology and the
psychology of human life.

1503
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:58,840
So this is the kind of study
that gets a lot of attention,

1504
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:01,705
because if we had it exactly
right, which we don't yet, we

1505
01:00:01,705 --> 01:00:03,890
would understand something
really deep about people and

1506
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:05,140
vulnerability in environments.

1507
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:24,767
