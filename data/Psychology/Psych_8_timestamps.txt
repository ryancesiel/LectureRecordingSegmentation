10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,670
PROFESSOR: Last time, we talked
about attention and the

11
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,990
idea that attention has
got some properties.

12
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,270
We're very limited in what
we can focus on.

13
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,580
We attend to less than
we might guess in our

14
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,620
environment.

15
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,730
On the other hand, there are
channels of information that

16
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,460
sneak into us unconsciously
or with minimal attention.

17
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,030
And experimental research has
shown us what requires our

18
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,290
focused attention to be noticed
and what can sneak in

19
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:55,290
through pathways, things like
features in our environment.

20
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,480
And so I want to talk to you
today about two kinds of

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,690
spectacular disorders of
attention in a higher level

22
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,390
vision and insight they
give us into the

23
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,600
brain basis of attention.

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,720
And again, the message is how
much we construct by the rules

25
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,110
of our mind and brain
the environment that

26
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,940
we see around us.

27
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,890
So we'll talk about
blindsight.

28
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,690
That's a great name, the
paradoxical state that people

29
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,580
are cortically blind, but they
kind of perceive some things.

30
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,430
So we'll talk about that.

31
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:25,570
What is it?

32
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,380
What do we know about
its brain basis?

33
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,430
What system of unconscious
perception

34
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,030
might be in our brains?

35
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,300
In these patients, it's their
only visual system.

36
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,640
In you and I, it's something
in us, and we don't know

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,435
exactly what it's doing relative
to our conscious

38
00:01:40,435 --> 00:01:41,420
visual system.

39
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,100
But we have the same brain
system available to us.

40
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,780
And then neglect, what it is,
its brain basis, and how it

41
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,330
teaches us again how we
construct the world around us

42
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,960
to know what space we're in
and what's around us.

43
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,570

44
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,000
So a reminder, and I think you
know this well by now that the

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,830
world out there is divided into
a left and right visual

46
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,810
field as we look for it in the
middle, that the information

47
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,650
from the left visual field goes
through your brain and

48
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,539
ends up shown in the right
primary visual cortex, from

49
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:12,060
the right visual field
into your left

50
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,230
primary visual cortex.

51
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,850
But there's one other pathway
we haven't talked about very

52
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:20,730
much which goes to a structure
called the superior

53
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:21,060
colliculus.

54
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,450
It's part of your midbrain.

55
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,510
And it's the system we think
gives rise to the possibility

56
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,090
of sensation without
perception.

57
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,230
That phrase, sensation without
perception, is a good one to

58
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,420
describe blindsight.

59
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,070
And we'll describe
it in a moment.

60
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:37,080
So from your retina, where all
vision has to go through, a

61
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,750
little bit of information--

62
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,730
a small number of fibers-- go
to part of your brain that

63
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,450
controls your pupillary
reflexes, what makes your

64
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:47,270
pupils get wider or
smaller to see.

65
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:51,720
90% of the fibers coming in, the
fibers come from your eye

66
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,010
and go through the lateral
geniculate or through the

67
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,890
major system that you've heard
about from Melissa that

68
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,230
connect to your primary
visual cortex.

69
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,760
And then, there's one other
small visual pathway from your

70
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,520
retina to this superior
colliculus sometimes called a

71
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,760
tectopulvinar system.

72
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,580
So it's a small pathway from
your eyes in terms of the

73
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,140
number of nerve fibers.

74
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,350
And so people said, well, can we
say what's not done by the

75
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:20,090
major visual pathway that goes
from the eye to the cortex?

76
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,130
What's done by this other
small pathway?

77
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,090
And one of the ways they looked
at it originally all

78
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,710
the way back in 1881 was to
create in dogs bilateral

79
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,820
occipital lesions.

80
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,900
So now, they're cortically
blind.

81
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,390
They're not retinally blind.

82
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,220
They're cortically blind.

83
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,540
It's in the cortex.

84
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,670
And what could these
animals do?

85
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,540
And they were very impressed.

86
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,140
Although these animals didn't
recognize many things, they

87
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,760
could steer their way around
their environment.

88
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,330
They wouldn't bump
into things.

89
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:47,360
If you had a blindfold on or
if you were retinally blind

90
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,250
and weren't given any
opportunity to know your

91
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,870
environment, you would bump
into things, right?

92
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,530
But these animals seemed to
steer their way around things

93
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,510
pretty well.

94
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,970
And they can do some other very
simple tasks even though

95
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,190
they ought to have been
seeing nothing.

96
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,640
So this is a suggestion in
animals that there's something

97
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,910
in the brains of primates that
gives you some information

98
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:11,570
that doesn't go through
your conscious cortex.

99
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:14,640
And then, a number of patient
studies in patients with

100
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,510
naturally occurring injuries
have really shown us, given us

101
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,230
a chance to experiment on them
in a human and relate them to

102
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,000
human experience.

103
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,550
So here's a patient who had a
large injury, a large bleed,

104
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,410
in the right visual cortex.

105
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,070
So because of this, this
patient, this man was blind in

106
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,550
the left visual field.

107
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,860
This field was fine.

108
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,580
This field was blind.

109
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,770
Cortically blind.

110
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:43,770
And the way that people figure
out in what way are you blind,

111
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,590
what parts of the world do you
see and do you not see, is

112
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,610
they'll put you in front
of a computer monitor.

113
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,350
And they'll turn on lights
in various locations.

114
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:54,760
And they'll create a map like
this, which shows you where

115
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,370
you respond when a light comes
on and where you don't see it.

116
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,440
So your job, basically you
just look in the middle.

117
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,520
And you say, push a button
when a light comes on.

118
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,080
So you're waiting.

119
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,530
And a light comes on somewhere
on the monitor.

120
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,610
So what this picture is showing
you is that the person

121
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,940
could respond when the lights
came on anywhere on the left

122
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:15,110
side, but never responded, never
said a light came on on

123
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,660
the right side.

124
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,780
People call this perimetry.

125
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,070
It's a standard neurological
test of visual difficulty.

126
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,400
Here's a person whose injury
harms only a quadrant of their

127
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:24,970
visual field.

128
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,410
So they never respond when a
light turns on in that quarter

129
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,090
of the world out there.

130
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,840
But the other three quarters,
they respond to.

131
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,500
So that's a way of testing
what do you do.

132
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,470
And you're not asking them
anything sophisticated, just

133
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,060
did a light come on.

134
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,980
Is that OK?

135
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,480
So for this patient,
here's the mapping.

136
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,650
This patient was fine in
the right visual field.

137
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,540
This is one eye.

138
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,980
This is the other eye.

139
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,230
And terrible--

140
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,990
with a few spots a little bit
better-- because lesions

141
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,120
occurring naturally in people
are seldom perfect lesions.

142
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,720
But you can see that all this
area that's dark are areas

143
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,260
that, when a light came on in
the left visual field, this

144
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:02,580
man never responded that
anything had turned on.

145
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,140
There's nothing simpler,
right, than a light

146
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,600
turning on and off.

147
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,110
He did not experience anything
turning on in that way in the

148
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,170
left half of the world.

149
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:18,512
So they noticed as they gave
this test that even though he

150
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:21,490
was saying, I don't see
anything, nothing's happening,

151
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,690
that when they flash something
in that cortically blind

152
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,290
field, he would move his eyes
in that direction as if

153
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,290
something in his mind
and brain felt

154
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,075
something had happened.

155
00:06:31,075 --> 00:06:34,340
Not only something happened, but
roughly where it happened.

156
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,480
But that information was
not available to

157
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,250
his conscious mind.

158
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,280
He's never pushing a button
that he says he saw it.

159
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,380
He always says nothing.

160
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,740
I'm waiting for something
to come on.

161
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,960
And if it comes on in his
good field, he responds.

162
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,020
Does that make sense, OK?

163
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,860
But something seemed to do it.

164
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,920
And when they found that it was
better than chance in the

165
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,510
left visual field, about things
like if they put on a

166
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,240
bigger patch of light.

167
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,650
He could tell if they gave him
a short line or a long line.

168
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:59,300
Now, he would never say,
I see the line.

169
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,670
You would have to make
him make a guess.

170
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,100
So when you read the papers,
it's something like, I don't

171
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,550
see anything.

172
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,210
I don't see anything.

173
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,370
Well, you must guess.

174
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,540
Is it a short line
or a long line?

175
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,410
I don't see it.

176
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,660
There's no basis for
me to guess.

177
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,220
It'll be a completely
random guess.

178
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,810
But you must guess, OK?

179
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,190
Short or long?

180
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,980
And then, if the lines are far
enough apart in size, he's

181
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,806
almost 100%--

182
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:20,690
97% accurate.

183
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,070
If he's forced to guess but he
never has the experience that

184
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,650
he sees the line, he's just
forced to guess and told that

185
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:27,700
it's two lines.

186
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,210
Or he can judge things like,
is it a circle or a cross?

187
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,800
Is it an x or an o?

188
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,060
But he can't do something like
a square versus a rectangle.

189
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,630
It's very limited.

190
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,710
Subjectively, he always
feels he sees nothing.

191
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:42,780
If he's given two choices, for
some things he can make the

192
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,800
correct choice if he's forced
to make a guess.

193
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,170
And there's other sophisticated
ways, again, to

194
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:52,210
show that even though he's
unconscious of anything in his

195
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:56,210
blind field, something in his
mind and brain is processing

196
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,410
information there.

197
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,710
So here, they had a thing where
he pushed a button when

198
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,010
a light came on.

199
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,500
This is his good field.

200
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,050
And it takes him, on average,
359 milliseconds.

201
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,080
Now, they do the same thing.

202
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,250
This is his good field.

203
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,690
But they put on at the
same time a light

204
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,320
in his blind field.

205
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,620
And when they do that, his time
goes up by about a tenth

206
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,440
of a second as if the
distraction in the blind field

207
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,130
was slightly distracting him
from making that button press.

208
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:26,370
So another objective way of
demonstrating that some

209
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,780
information has been processed
in the blind field even though

210
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,820
he never says he feels like
something's happening there.

211
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,500

212
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,419
So here's one more patient, and
the last one I'll show you

213
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:41,470
of this kind, who had the
unfortunate occurrence of

214
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:45,270
having two strokes, one in the
left occipital cortex and one

215
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:50,230
in the right occipital cortex,
about 36 days apart.

216
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,910
So now, he was blind in both
fields by the time he had had

217
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,820
both of his strokes.

218
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,140
So he was a very
unlucky person.

219
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,140
Here in the dark is
the missing cortex

220
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,390
that has died away.

221
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:09,700

222
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,580
Now, always the problems with
humans is the injuries are not

223
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,430
controlled and precise.

224
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:19,550
And so here's two examples, one
in monkeys, an incredibly

225
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:23,110
clever experiment to get a
monkey to tell you what he or

226
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,380
she is thinking about.

227
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,550
And then, one with infants
as well, human infants.

228
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,600
And how do you get a monkey
to talk to you about their

229
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,900
subjective experience?

230
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,230
The striking thing about
blindside is the person's

231
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,110
saying, I see nothing.

232
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:34,670
I see nothing.

233
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:38,210
I see nothing, even as he walks
past obstacles with

234
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,600
precision and carefulness.

235
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,025
So here, what it is, they took
monkeys and made unilateral

236
00:09:43,025 --> 00:09:44,060
lesions in them.

237
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,090
There's a control monkey and
three where they surgically

238
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,290
removed, as precisely as they
could, the left occipital

239
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,510
visual cortex and the corpus
callosum that connects the

240
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,050
left and the right.

241
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,620
And the first task-- and I'll
show you in a moment-- was to

242
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,470
touch a light when
it comes on.

243
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,730
And the second half is the
clever design to get the

244
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:05,810
monkey to tell you what
he or she subjectively

245
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:08,550
feels is going on.

246
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,370
So here's the video they would
make of the monkey.

247
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,790
And in one case, here's
the light coming on.

248
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,030
So the monkeys had
left removal.

249
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:19,140
So this is the blind side.

250
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,310
These bars show you how often
they point correctly to a

251
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,520
light going on.

252
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,060
And under this circumstance,
forced to point, forced to

253
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,850
point, here's the
control animal.

254
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,420
And you can see that the animals
who are blind in this

255
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,190
field do almost perfectly.

256
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,950
When they're forced to point,
they pick almost perfectly

257
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:42,020
which stimulus comes on
in the blind field.

258
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,205
Now, they add one more thing
to the experiment.

259
00:10:45,205 --> 00:10:49,380
They have a number of lights
on the good side.

260
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,370
Here is a response that they
can push to signal "I saw

261
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:56,540
nothing." And if they truly
saw nothing, they get the

262
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,250
juice reward for which
they're working for.

263
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,912
But there's a light that can
come on here in their bad

264
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:04,290
field on their right side.

265
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,800
Now, what happens?

266
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,570
Here's the control monkey doing
perfectly well for the

267
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:12,410
lights on this side, lights on
this side, and when nothing is

268
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,400
happening pushing this
bar to signal

269
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,450
that nothing is happening.

270
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,570
Sometimes, no light comes on.

271
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,330
So now, the monkeys will have
to say, "I see nothing," by

272
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,830
pushing this big panel up
here if nothing seems

273
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,230
to have turned on.

274
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:26,660
But look what happens to the
monkeys with the cortical

275
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,230
lesions on the left.

276
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:32,230
When this light comes on, they
almost never say they saw it.

277
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,070
They almost always push,
"I saw nothing."

278
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:39,240
When they're allowed to say "I
saw nothing" by the response,

279
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,590
then even though this thing that
you know they can see--

280
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,330
because you see here
they're responding

281
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,630
perfectly well over here--

282
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:49,040
but when allowed to consciously
respond what they

283
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,240
see, then these black bars
are all the way down.

284
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,590
They almost never indicate
they saw something.

285
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,950
They almost always pick the
response, "I saw nothing." So

286
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,380
the monkey is telling you what
his subjective experience is,

287
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,870
which is like the humans with
the cortical lesions.

288
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:06,930
They're reporting they see
nothing, even though some part

289
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:09,750
of their brain can pick it up.

290
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,640
How about in humans?

291
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,550
So sometimes humans, children,
infants, for medical reasons

292
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,580
have to have hemispherectomies
in the first year.

293
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,050
These are unfortunate infants
who have severe brain

294
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,160
injuries, severe epilepsy.

295
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,540
And it's considered better to
help them by removing an

296
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,670
entire hemisphere than to let
them have the severity of the

297
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,870
epilepsy they were having.

298
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,820
These are rare cases in very
unfortunate infants.

299
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,950
And in these infants who got
this for purely medical

300
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:38,150
reasons to make their lives
better, they also did an

301
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:41,100
experiment to show you something
not only about, I

302
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,930
think, again, what happens in
our conscious visual system,

303
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:48,940
but also how that system grows
in infancy and the growth of a

304
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,780
conscious cortical
visual system.

305
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,510
So here's what they did.

306
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,960
Infants this young-- because
they're in their first year--

307
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,880
can't even point and you can't
tell them to point.

308
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,990
So again, you have to be
clever experimentally.

309
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,360
And what they did is they
watched where their eyes moved

310
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,600
and recorded that information.

311
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,420
And that was the behavior.

312
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,550
Sometimes, they would
have a fixation.

313
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,630
They've always had a fixation.

314
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,870
You're looking in the middle.

315
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:16,070
And then, something would come
on out of side or this side,

316
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:19,420
in the blind field or
in the intact field.

317
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,190

318
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,080
And they would see how often
would their eyes move to a

319
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,420
stimulus in their good
field, which they

320
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,550
expected all the time.

321
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,560
But how often would it move to
the stimulus in the blind

322
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,280
field, the eye movement?

323
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,180
Then, they had a competition
condition where you have a dot

324
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,010
in the middle.

325
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:39,350
And that fixation dot would stay
on while a box appeared

326
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,720
here or here.

327
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,500
So the only sense--

328
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,920
the only difference between
these two is there's a dot in

329
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,120
the middle that can compete
for what you look at.

330
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,420
OK?

331
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,250
It's not a big competition.

332
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,160
It's just a boring dot
that stays on.

333
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,950
But there's a big consequence.

334
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:55,020
So here's how often they moved
their eyes to the target in

335
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,610
the non-competition condition.

336
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,620
The dot goes on.

337
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,400
It goes off.

338
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,640
And the box comes on in your
good field or your bad field.

339
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,720
And all these bars are
up at the top.

340
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,795
And practically every trial, at
eight weeks, 10 weeks, and

341
00:14:07,795 --> 00:14:11,540
12 weeks of age, the infant
moves his or her eyes to the

342
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,980
stimulus whether it's in the
blind field or the good field.

343
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,370
So something in their mind and
brain is letting them identify

344
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:20,150
something and moves their eyes
to the good field, much like

345
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,100
we talked about before
for the adults.

346
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,100
Now, in the competition
condition, you can already see

347
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,060
it's not quite the same.

348
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,130
If there's a dot on and the
box comes on their blind

349
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:33,050
field, they don't always
make it to the box.

350
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:37,540
That dot is capturing their
conscious cortical attention

351
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,810
and diminishing the likelihood
they notice the box coming on

352
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,240
in the blind field.

353
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,810
And as the weeks pass from
eight to 10 to 12, just a

354
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,270
month of development,
look what happens.

355
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:51,530
This bar goes from a little
lower, a lot lower, near zero.

356
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:54,060
That is, from eight to 12 weeks,
what it looks like is

357
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,370
happening is that as the
cortical system matures and

358
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:04,420
the infant's consciousness is
growing in some sense, now

359
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,920
it's no longer tending to
process the information in the

360
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,470
blind field if there's
competition.

361
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:15,130
Because the growth of that
consciousness in the cortex is

362
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:19,730
suppressing the ability of the
infant to communicate with

363
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,480
unconscious systems or be guided
by unconscious systems

364
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,730
in the brain.

365
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,370
So the cool thing is the
implication of this, is all of

366
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:30,740
us have this collicular
system in us.

367
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,480
It's a visual system
that's been around

368
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,600
long through evolution.

369
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,495
All of us have this massive
conscious geniculate, the one

370
00:15:39,495 --> 00:15:41,270
that goes into your
cortex system.

371
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,430
And that dominates this
other system.

372
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:46,100
And so we only see it
revealed in these

373
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,560
patients as guiding behavior.

374
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,970
But who knows what it
really does in us?

375
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,760
Because it's quietly
sitting there.

376
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,460
We don't have conscious
access to it.

377
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,140
And who knows how much it's
guiding our behavior?

378
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,350
And it's very hard to
figure that out.

379
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:02,080
But it's definitely disappearing
from our

380
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,160
conscious life within the first
couple months of our

381
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,430
development.

382
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:11,240
So now, I'm going to switch to
the second major disorder

383
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:16,010
we'll talk about, attention and
neglect, and go through

384
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:19,230
anosagnosia, a spectacular
version of that disorder,

385
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,100
something about how it's
behaviorally measured, its

386
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,170
brain basis, and then
a few more analyses.

387
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:26,570
But in the book, there's
a very nice

388
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,730
chapter about these patients.

389
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:31,620
Now, patients with blindsight
are extremely rare.

390
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:35,800
You have to have exactly the
right kind of injury to damage

391
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,160
a lot of your occipital
cortex.

392
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,350
And those kinds of injuries
rarely occur on that scale.

393
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:45,100
Attention and neglect, what I'm
about to describe to you,

394
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,740
if any of you become physicians
or work in hospital

395
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:52,250
settings, you are guaranteed
to see this a lot.

396
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:56,780
A lot-- it's very, very common
for patients who've had things

397
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,380
like stroke or brain injuries
of some kind or another.

398
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,890
And a pretty typical example
is from Oliver Sacks.

399
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,630
Most of the Sacks cases are
pretty rare, prosopagnosia,

400
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,690
pretty rare.

401
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:07,310
Neglect?

402
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,950
Incredibly common in
the hospital ward,

403
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,400
in neurology service.

404
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,455
So here, he talks about a woman,
an intelligent woman in

405
00:17:12,455 --> 00:17:15,119
her 60s, massive stroke
affecting deep or inner back

406
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,380
portions of her right cerebral
hemisphere, good

407
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,740
intelligence and humor.

408
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,010
And what happens to her when
they bring her her dessert or

409
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:24,700
coffee on her tray
in the hospital?

410
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,630
PROFESSOR: Yeah, she complains
that she's not getting enough

411
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:30,320
food because she's only
eating food on the

412
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,810
right half of her plate.

413
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,680
The left half of the plate,
it's as if it

414
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,960
weren't present for her.

415
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,540
When they say, "But Mrs. S.,
it is right there on the

416
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,530
left," she seems not to
understand what they say and

417
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,580
does not look to the left.

418
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,640
If her head is gently turned
so the dessert comes into

419
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,140
sight in the preserved right
half of her field, she says,

420
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,030
"Oh, there it is!

421
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,720
It wasn't there before."

422
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,130
You understand?

423
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,450
It's as if the left half of
the plate did not exist.

424
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:57,740
And if they swivel her head and
now that left half of her

425
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,790
plate is in her right field,
now she goes, oh my gosh!

426
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,400
Who snuck that on my plate?

427
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,170
Now I can finish my meal.

428
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,090
And it's not just that.

429
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:10,350
She also only puts on makeup
on half her face looking in

430
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:14,180
the mirror, which can lead
to comical impressions.

431
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:18,330
So she ignores the left
half of her world.

432
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,660
And it's not just that
it isn't there.

433
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,990
It's as if it couldn't
be there.

434
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,180
It's as if, what are you talking
about there's a left

435
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,090
half of something?

436
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,540
I see everything.

437
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,250
So we'll talk a little about
this and understand more

438
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,280
of it coming up.

439
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,480
So neglect means a failure to
respond or report to something

440
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,540
that's opposite to the lesion--
contralateral means

441
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,910
opposite to the lesion--

442
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,420
that can't be accounted
for by simple things.

443
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,010
These patients don't have
primary visual problems.

444
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:41,980
They understand language.

445
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,180
They're paying attention.

446
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,930
They're the ones who deny the
left half of their body.

447
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,900
They dress on one side.

448
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,130
They eat from one side
of the plate.

449
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,100
And they also have something
that I'll show you in a

450
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,400
moment, the example because it
comes back a couple times.

451
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,360
And it sounds fancy,
but it's simple.

452
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,060
There's extinction to double
simultaneous stimulation seen

453
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,740
in the late stages.

454
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,190
So here's what the neurologist
does-- and you'll see at least

455
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,590
one neurologist doing this in
a film clip coming up-- and

456
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,650
they do this all the time
in the hospital.

457
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,930
They'll wiggle their fingers.

458
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,800
They'll try to get it in the
middle of the patient.

459
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,515
This isn't carefully controlled,
but it's done on

460
00:19:15,515 --> 00:19:16,360
the bedside.

461
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,570
They'll wiggle one side
and say, do you

462
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,580
see anything moving?

463
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:21,690
Or the other side, and sometimes
they wiggle both.

464
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:24,570
And the typical response
in neglect is already

465
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,600
fascinating.

466
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,920
So past the early stages of the
disorder, they'll notice

467
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,790
the thing on the left side.

468
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,440
From their perspective, that's
their neglected side.

469
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,700
They'll notice it on
the right side.

470
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,650
That's their good side.

471
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,420
They're noticing this
finger wiggling.

472
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,550
They're noticing that
finger wiggling.

473
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:43,800
But when the physician wiggles
both fingers at the same time,

474
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,490
then the patient will
only notice the

475
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,680
one on the good side.

476
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,170
It's as if this is extinguished
because this one

477
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,850
grabs your attention.

478
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,540
And you know they can
see it by itself.

479
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:59,070
So it's only when it's both
sides that it's extinguished.

480
00:19:59,070 --> 00:19:59,950
And we'll come back to that.

481
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:00,640
It's interesting.

482
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,260
It's not that their
mind can't see.

483
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,585
But when there's competition
in the two fields-- which

484
00:20:04,585 --> 00:20:05,980
reminds me a little bit
of blindsight --

485
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,120
then their mind can't see it.

486
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:15,930
So a strong, a fascinating and
rarer piece of this, but again

487
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,810
not very rare, is something
called anosagnosia where they

488
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:23,140
not only have the neglect that
I just described, but they

489
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,700
deny any problem at all.

490
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,200
So typically, the patient has a
big, right lesions, about 5%

491
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,720
of neglect cases.

492
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,460
And a very fascinating
neuroscientist, you may have

493
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,170
read some of his stuff.

494
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:40,330
He's a very creative mind,
Ramachandran at UCSD, did some

495
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:43,110
semi-experiments with some
of these patients.

496
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:46,590
So these are patients with
right sided lesions.

497
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:49,220
It says they have weakness or
non-use of their left hand.

498
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,670
And so here's his dialogue
with them.

499
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:51,850
Can you use your right hand?

500
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,260
And that patient's
hand is fine.

501
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,100
Yes.

502
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,230
Can use your left hand?

503
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:56,930
Yes.

504
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:59,870
The patient can't use
her left hand.

505
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,900
Are your hands equally strong?

506
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,940
Yes.

507
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,360
Can you point to my nose
with your right hand?

508
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:05,860
And she does.

509
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,200
Her right hand is fine.

510
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,050
Can you point to my nose
with your left hand?

511
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,480
The paralyzed left hand-- it's
the left hand because it's a

512
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,870
right hemisphere stroke--

513
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,850
does not move at all.

514
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,310
Are you pointing to my nose?

515
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,010
Yes.

516
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,950
Can clearly see it pointing?

517
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,670
Yes, it's about two inches
from your nose.

518
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:23,350
Can you clap?

519
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,270
Of course I can clap.

520
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,925
And here's what she does.

521
00:21:25,925 --> 00:21:26,960
Are you clapping?

522
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,520
Yes, I'm clapping.

523
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,680
She can't move her left side.

524
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,710
But in every way in this
patient's reports, she seems

525
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:37,680
to deny in a deep sense that
there's any problem in her

526
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,910
performance or any weakness
of any kind.

527
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:45,370
So he wanted to do a couple
little experiments to show

528
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:51,120
that it's not just that they're
saying, but they'll

529
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,820
follow all the way through.

530
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:55,540
So imagine that you had
injured your left

531
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,900
arm, was in a cast.

532
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,930
And somebody asked you, I'm
going to give you two choices.

533
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:02,480
I'm going to give you $5 to
screw in a light bulb--

534
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,340
your left arm is
in a cast now--

535
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,400
or $10 to tie your shoe laces.

536
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,080
Which would you take?

537
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,740
The light bulb, right?

538
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,360
Because it's going to be hard
to tie your shoe laces with

539
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,770
one arm out of action.

540
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:14,970
This person is the same way.

541
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:15,730
She's had a stroke.

542
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,160
Her left arm's not
functioning.

543
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:21,060
She should definitely
take the light bulb.

544
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,480
She takes the shoe laces.

545
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,710
When the physician,
Ramachandran, describes as she

546
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,300
sits there with one hand trying
to flop the laces

547
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:32,320
together making no progress at
all, he says finally he has to

548
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,550
end the exercise.

549
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,710
He can't take it anymore.

550
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,380
She'll just keep going until--

551
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,815
So she just doesn't process
that her left side of her

552
00:22:41,815 --> 00:22:42,970
body's not working.

553
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:46,130
And then, he does another
experiment more impressive.

554
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:49,060
I can use one of
these, I think.

555
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:53,870
So imagine this was a tray of
cocktail glasses full of

556
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,670
water, let's say to
the very brim.

557
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:58,190
Imagine there's three here
and three-- six things.

558
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,410
You can see they're
right at the top.

559
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,350
And you're just hoping that the
person bringing it to you

560
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,770
doesn't spill it on you.

561
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:07,320
And the person brings it over
to you, actually filled with

562
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,110
water and asks a patient
to hold the tray.

563
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,580
OK, can I pick on you
for one second?

564
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,830
Imagine you had only--

565
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,290

566
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:18,250
how would you hold the
tray if one arm was

567
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,912
unavailable for you?

568
00:23:19,912 --> 00:23:22,270
OK, I'm bringing this over.

569
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,810
You have to watch,
very exciting.

570
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,640
There's water.

571
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,760
Yes, OK.

572
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,690
How would you had if two hands
were available to you?

573
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:29,300
OK, thank you.

574
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:29,640
OK, right?

575
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,660
That's easy for you to imagine
how you would hold it.

576
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,390
They walk over to the patient
with all this stuff.

577
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,030
They hand it to her.

578
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,120
And what does the patient do?

579
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,840
She puts out her right hand
on the right side.

580
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,590
And the whole thing
falls over.

581
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:41,760
They're trying to demonstrate
it goes all the way through.

582
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,200
This person really believes
there's not a problem.

583
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,610
And they can be doused in water
for a moment-- and I'm

584
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,220
sure dried appropriately--

585
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:53,030
and still deny there's
any problem at all.

586
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,100
Now, one thing they can do--
and this is a weird line of

587
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,760
research, but there's a number
of papers that show this.

588
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,580
And I'm not recommending you
do this at home because

589
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:04,290
actually, it's worse
than it sounds.

590
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:06,750
They take a syringe with cold
water, and they put it into

591
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,510
the left ear, the
image is here.

592
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,650
The patient's eye
starts to move.

593
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,020
They get a nystagmus.

594
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,370
And they ask them
how they feel.

595
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,790
And then she says, my
ear is very cold.

596
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,040
But other than that, I'm fine.

597
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,530

598
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,070
But they've given her
a little bit of a

599
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,110
shock in the left ear.

600
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:27,220
And now, he does the interesting
experiment.

601
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,700
Do you feel OK?

602
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,940
She says her ear is cold.

603
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,180
Can you use your hands?

604
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,020
At this moment when they've done
something in the left ear

605
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:37,250
that wakes up the opposite
right hemisphere.

606
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,405
I can use my right arm,
but not my left arm.

607
00:24:39,405 --> 00:24:41,310
I want to move it, but
it doesn't move.

608
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,370
This happens just in a
moment from the cold

609
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:44,660
syringe in her ear.

610
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,690
Whose arm is this? holding
up the paralyzed arm.

611
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:47,900
It's mine, of course.

612
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,730
Can you use it?

613
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:51,330
No, it's paralyzed-- like, what
kind of doctor do I have?

614
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:53,330
It's paralyzed, of course.

615
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,360
Now, here's something
really fun in a

616
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,290
Sherlock Holmesian sense.

617
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:58,705
How long has your arm
been paralyzed?

618
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,030
Did it start just now?

619
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:02,620
Because what he's asking is,
does she have a memory

620
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,810
somewhere in her mind of her
entire experience, or does she

621
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:07,040
say it just started right now?

622
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:07,910
I don't know how
this happened.

623
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:08,680
It's just not working.

624
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,350
And she says, it's been
paralyzed for

625
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,250
several days now.

626
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,500
About 90 minutes later when they
redo this, she's back to

627
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,880
just how she was.

628
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,100
So they can temporarily
alleviate this by this

629
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,130
irrigation to the ear.

630
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:25,730
So this denial of the left half
of your body, this denial

631
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:28,240
that you have any disorder
whatsoever is a

632
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,280
very striking thing.

633
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,140
In most patients,
it clears up.

634
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,080
You saw pictures of
it from Melissa.

635
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,600
You saw movies of patients
with object disorders.

636
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,800
Those don't clear up.

637
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,580
Balint's syndrome, spatial
disorders--

638
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,820
those don't clear up.

639
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,280
Anosagnosia patients
grow out of it.

640
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:47,750
Somehow, their brains
recover over time.

641
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:50,500
But again, it shows you
how much attention is

642
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,370
constructed, right?

643
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:53,210
Because they have the
stuff to represent

644
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:54,690
their arm, their disease.

645
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,870
That's all in their
mind and brain.

646
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,940
But the state they're in because
of the brain injury

647
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,790
lets them not construct
that reality.

648
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,390
So now, I'm going to show
you measures of neglect.

649
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,100
This is in your list just for
your notes, but sort of fun

650
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,330
just to look at the examples.

651
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:07,940
So here's a patient.

652
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,910
With these patients, they
typically have right sided

653
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:12,430
lesions, so the neglect is to
the left half of the world.

654
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:15,610
And here's a patient going to
the bathroom as if all you can

655
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:19,600
do is make right turns instead
of going this way, as if the

656
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,430
world weren't there, to
proceed on the left.

657
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:24,240
Here's another test
that happens

658
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,020
every day in a hospital.

659
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,270
The physician has drawn
these lines and says,

660
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,700
cross out the lines.

661
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,680
It's not perfect.

662
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,510
The patient does that one.

663
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,500
But look, they cross out
all these lines.

664
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,530
And the left half ones are
mostly left uncrossed.

665
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:39,380
It's as if they weren't there.

666
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,060
Here's what's called a
cancellation test.

667
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,010
There's lots of letters here.

668
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:44,640
And their job is to cross
out all the A's.

669
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,200
Now, let me start
with neglect.

670
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,980
You see over here,
this whole area?

671
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,430
Nothing is circled
or crossed out.

672
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,760
And you could say, well, what
would happen if instead of

673
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,970
neglect, you were like one of
those blindsight patients who

674
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:59,740
had a big lesion in the
cortex and you were

675
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,460
blind on one side?

676
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,750
What would you do there?

677
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,660
Well, it's easy for those
patients because what they do

678
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,480
is they don't see part
of the world.

679
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,860
But what do they do?

680
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:11,180
They turn their head, just
like you would do.

681
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,190
They turn their head.

682
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,370
They don't see it, but they
know they don't see it.

683
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:15,870
And they turn their head.

684
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:18,790
And a patient who's blind on one
side, loss in the visual

685
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:22,200
field, gets all the lines
because all you have to do if

686
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,050
you're blind on one side
is turn your head.

687
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:29,100
It's not that hard in
a practical sense.

688
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,110
But if you don't imagine the
left half of the world exists,

689
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,540
where would you turn
your head to?

690
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,620
And that's what these neglect
patients do, don't imagine the

691
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,640
left half of the world exists.

692
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,270
So here's an example of a
patient reading a text.

693
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,690
They're handed this text.

694
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:45,710
The slash lines here are where
this patient seems to think

695
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:48,790
the left side of
the page stops.

696
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:52,360
OK So they're overcoming
everything they know about how

697
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,600
a sentence should be and
reading this passage.

698
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,410
The patient says, "had to pass
the windows whom good morning

699
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:02,560
message for the ground his with
all his and he bottle."

700
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,940
Thank you very much.

701
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,985
It's right in front of them, but
the left half of the page

702
00:28:07,985 --> 00:28:12,110
is just not present for
this person's mind.

703
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:14,550
Here is a person copying
a flower.

704
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:17,170
A psychologist or a neurologist
draws this flower

705
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:19,890
or has a flower ready to go,
a drawing, and says copy

706
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:21,230
everything you see.

707
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:23,790
And it's not always totally
perfect exactly how it works.

708
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:26,240
But you can see there's a lot
of the left side of this

709
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,810
flower missing--

710
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:30,390
right in front of them.

711
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,690
Here's a very simple one, too.

712
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,680
Copy everything you see here.

713
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,930
And what they see is these
three things up here.

714
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:38,010
Their job's to copy everything
down here.

715
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,810
They have all the
time they want.

716
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:40,870
Left side is neglected.

717
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,170
And all they copy
is the triangle.

718
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,470
That's all they draw.

719
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:45,850
And the tester will always
say, are you done?

720
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:46,800
Are you sure you're done?

721
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,730
The person says, I'm
sure I'm done.

722
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:50,580
Thank you very much.

723
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,180
Sometimes, they do something
remarkable.

724
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,410
They're shown a scene
like this.

725
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:56,400
Here's four trees with a
house in the middle.

726
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,740
And you can see this patient
starts over here.

727
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,120
They say, oh, there's a
tree over, draws this.

728
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,280
There's a house over here.

729
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,990
And they jump from location
to location.

730
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:08,230
Every time their attention
lands, they draw the right

731
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:10,060
half of it.

732
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,910
It's always as if the
left were missing.

733
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:16,290
And again, this idea of how
constructed this is.

734
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,250
Here's two more examples.

735
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,430
And the clock thing, we'll
talk a fair bit about.

736
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:20,670
Here's a patient writing
to dictation.

737
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:21,890
The first sentence, they
sort of stay--

738
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,450
but now, it's as if they
were running out

739
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:25,110
of room on the page.

740
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,580
It's like they're reading,
but it's writing.

741
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,680
The left half of the
page doesn't exist.

742
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,530
Clocks are used a lot in this
land, because it's kind of

743
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:31,010
impressive.

744
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,470
And we'll come back in a couple
different versions

745
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:32,850
about this.

746
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:33,970
But look at that.

747
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:37,620
They were asked to draw
the time on a clock.

748
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,950
And it's as if they could draw
the time on the right side,

749
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:40,910
their good side.

750
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:44,620
But it's as if the left half
of the clock didn't exist.

751
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:48,180
Here's another patient asked
to draw the time.

752
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:53,720
And you see almost what seems
like a struggle in the

753
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,320
patient, right?

754
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,010
They start on the right side.

755
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,640
And then here, they're
running out of space.

756
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,030
They've got to cram
in that 10.

757
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,190
Their mind knows it
goes to 12, right?

758
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:03,580
But there's no space
to put it in.

759
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:07,310
And so you put them, in a sense,
in a sense of conflict.

760
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,640
And that's the top version.

761
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,680
The bottom, they were given
numbers one at a time.

762
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,370
They were given, it tells
you here, 12 and 6.

763
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:16,000
So they put those in
the right spots.

764
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,990
Here comes 11.

765
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:20,360
Already, 11 is like,
uh-oh, right?

766
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,790
And then, they get 4, 9.

767
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,210
9 is not going to make it.

768
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:27,530
And 10, they know it has to come
after-- you can see that

769
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:30,990
they put them actually in a
struggle between what they

770
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:33,520
know, something about where the
numbers ought to go, but

771
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,130
the impossibility of the
left half existing.

772
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,630
Now, here's something-- and
we'll come back to this in a

773
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,960
few minutes--

774
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,770
what happens if you just give
them a piece of paper and say,

775
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:43,770
write down 1 o'clock.

776
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:45,160
And then, you take that
piece of paper away.

777
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:45,910
Write down 2 o'clock.

778
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,190
Take that piece of paper away.

779
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:47,550
Then look--

780
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:51,210
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, those
are not bad, right?

781
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:54,770
If they just do one of them, the
very same patient who had

782
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,690
to crowd everything on the right
is quite comfortable in

783
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,160
putting down a pretty good
9, 10, and 11 if

784
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,830
it's just one of them.

785
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:05,040
We'll come back in a little bit
to experiments that help

786
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,990
understand what's going on this
case because we don't

787
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:11,010
only want a scientist
to say, wow, this is

788
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:12,460
unbelievable and amazing.

789
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,810
We like to say something more
about how the mind is doing

790
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:17,600
this and what part of their
brain is important.

791
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,110
And kind of impressively, here's
a patient with eyes

792
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,080
open mostly crowding
on the right.

793
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,640
Got the 10 on the left, but
doing a better job when their

794
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,310
eyes are closed.

795
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,610
They missed the dial
altogether.

796
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:29,880
Their eyes are closed.

797
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,120
But they actually do it--
the same patient

798
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,250
does a better job.

799
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:35,300
OK, so how does that work?

800
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,230
And one more thing to mention is
that neglect occurs across

801
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:38,790
modalities.

802
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,840
That is, when these patients
have neglect, I

803
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,390
focused on the visual.

804
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:45,710
But these patients also don't do
very well if they're doing

805
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,100
things like reaching
for things.

806
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,210
It's not just vision.

807
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:51,690
It's pretty much everything in
the left half of the world.

808
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:54,400
And you can do these kinds of
things which, again, show not

809
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,090
only their neglect but the
constructed psychological

810
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:58,460
nature of the neglect.

811
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,710
It varies in ways that
are interesting.

812
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,690
So they're given a line
like this and say

813
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:03,860
mark the exact middle.

814
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,210
You would draw something here.

815
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:07,240
They draw here because they're
going to neglect

816
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,660
that part of the line.

817
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:12,300
Then, they say read the A.
So they draw the person's

818
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,796
attention to A. And now draw
it, and they get better.

819
00:32:14,796 --> 00:32:17,370
Then, they're asked to
mark the middle.

820
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,420
Not too good.

821
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,030
Mark the middle-- but you
see the difference here.

822
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:22,120
The A is present or
the B is present.

823
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,210
And if the B is present, it
pulls them over here.

824
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,510
If the A is present, it pulls
their attention over here.

825
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,770
They put their hand at
the middle and say.

826
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:29,940
Now, please mark the middle.

827
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,600
Their hand goes over here
for the middle.

828
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,635
But if they start them all the
way over here, their hand will

829
00:32:33,635 --> 00:32:35,300
only go this far.

830
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,360
So as you see, all these
different movements are

831
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,340
telling you that the mind
is interpreting what the

832
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,570
world is out there.

833
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:44,650
If you pull a little bit the
person to the left, they'll

834
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:48,930
notice a little bit
more of the left.

835
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:50,180
Where is the injury?

836
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,650

837
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:56,220
So almost everywhere you read
still in neurology books to

838
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,980
this day that it's in
the parietal cortex.

839
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,630
But in the last few years,
people have mostly come to

840
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:04,760
this idea that the damage
tends to be in

841
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,450
the temporal lobe.

842
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:08,720
And what happens when the
temporal lobe is injured, it

843
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,910
knocks of the balance of
attention in the left and

844
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:13,680
right parietal cortex.

845
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,610
And there's something about
the activity in the right

846
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:18,250
parietal cortex goes way down.

847
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,620
That's paying attention to the
left half of the world.

848
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,990
And as patients recover from
this, the balance comes back.

849
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:25,260
And that's actually been
measured now by brain imaging.

850
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,700
Their attention comes back
clinically, and it does in

851
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,260
most patients.

852
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,980
Then, the balance between the
two parietal cortices get

853
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,680
reestablished.

854
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,690
So even though people thought
the site of damage was here,

855
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:38,830
the interpretation's usually
here in the temporal lobe.

856
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:43,160
But the consequence of that is
reduced activity in this part

857
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,010
of the brain, even if it's
not physically injured.

858
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:53,640

859
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,240
The fantastic thing is--

860
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,200
think about this for a second--
in order to ignore

861
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,030
the left half of the flower, the
left half of a design, the

862
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:04,230
left half of a page, the left
half of a clock, what do you

863
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:06,680
have to know?

864
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,910
Where the left and right are.

865
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:09,440
It's not as if his
eyes were closed.

866
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,120
If your eyes were closed, you
wouldn't know where left and

867
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,810
right are on a page, right?

868
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:15,980
He has to represent in his mind
what is left and right

869
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,639
reasonably accurately.

870
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,739
And then, he extinguishes
awareness that anything in the

871
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:21,940
left could exist.

872
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:24,120
But part of his mind has to know
what is left for that to

873
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:24,780
work, right?

874
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,219
Otherwise, the digits would be
all over the piece of paper,

875
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:28,555
not even on the paper.

876
00:34:28,555 --> 00:34:30,139
He centers on the paper.

877
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:32,179
He centers on the circle.

878
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:33,790
Centering means I know
what's left.

879
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,070
I know what's the center.

880
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:37,610
And then boom, the left
disappears as a place that

881
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:39,060
could exist.

882
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:42,179
So these are all tasks
in front of you.

883
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:45,449
There's been some incredibly
Sherlock Holmes like clever

884
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:50,900
experiments asking whether you
also neglect your imagination.

885
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,940
Not what's in front of you,
but your imagination.

886
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,469
So here's the way they did it.

887
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:57,640
Have any of you been in Milan?

888
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,310
There's a central cathedral
in part of town.

889
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:02,560
It's a big deal.

890
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,090
So they took Milanese patients,
people who lived in

891
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:06,110
Milan their whole lives who
had strokes in the right

892
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:08,920
hemisphere who had neglect, and
they asked them to imagine

893
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,130
the Piazza del Duomo, the major
church there, looking at

894
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:15,980
it from one side of the square
or from entering from the

895
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,160
opposite side of the square.

896
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,370
And I'll show you the
other experiment.

897
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,340
Here's the idea.

898
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:24,050
They said imagine that you're
entering the square this

899
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:27,730
direction so that the church
is behind you, or this

900
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,490
direction so that the church
is in front of you.

901
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,560
So you're entering the square
from one side or from the

902
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,090
other side.

903
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:34,700
Now, the square that you've been
too many times, that you

904
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,260
know very well, tell me
everything that's in the

905
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,640
square as you imagine entering
from one side.

906
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,040
And here's what the
patient reports.

907
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,150
They're imagining coming
out facing the church.

908
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:50,650
And they report these kinds
of things from this side.

909
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,990
If that's only on the
right side, they're

910
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:53,740
ignoring the thing.

911
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,890
So they say there's a cafe.

912
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:57,920
There's a bookstore or whatever
else there is here.

913
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,540
That's everything that's
in the square.

914
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,450
Everything that's in the
square is shown in red?

915
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,200
Everything that's
in the square.

916
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,540
They wait just moments.

917
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,950
And they say, now imagine
instead you were coming out

918
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:09,520
from the church, opposite
view of the square.

919
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,950
Tell me everything that's
in the square.

920
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:13,240
And here's what they tell you.

921
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,250
The items that are in blue--
and they don't tell you the

922
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,580
items they just told you, the
locations they've just told

923
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,900
you circled in red.

924
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,680
So they're sitting their
imagining their square.

925
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,190
And then, they will ignore
everything on the left,

926
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:28,050
whatever's their subject
of left.

927
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:30,140
And you know they know it
because all they have to do is

928
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,000
imagine they're on the opposite
side of the square,

929
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,370
and then they report.

930
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:34,090
Does that make sense?

931
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:38,450
They're ignoring the left half
of what they imagine the

932
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:41,860
square looks like when they've
been to it many times.

933
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:44,400
And here's another patient doing
exactly the same thing.

934
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,770
Imagine you're coming
out of the church.

935
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:46,700
What's in the square?

936
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,760
Well, here's some specific
places I know.

937
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,240
That's it?

938
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,450
That's it.

939
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:51,620
Wait a minute.

940
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:55,550
Imagine you come this way into
the square facing the church.

941
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,350
What's everything
in the square?

942
00:36:57,350 --> 00:37:01,020
And they only report the
things on this side.

943
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:01,870
So they're ignoring-- yeah?

944
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:07,230
AUDIENCE: Does the patient
realize after a few seconds?

945
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,260
PROFESSOR: No, they never do.

946
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,510
It's an excellent question.

947
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:12,530
They just answered a moment
ago one side, right?

948
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,230
Why don't they tell you, I just
told you the stuff on the

949
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,010
other side?

950
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:20,100
Because it's as if it
couldn't exist.

951
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,930
It's a little bit analogous
to the patient

952
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,390
whose arm isn't moving.

953
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:25,010
And you go, do you
have any problem?

954
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,690
And they go, no, I don't
have any problem.

955
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:29,020
It's as if there couldn't
be a problem.

956
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,630
What are you talking
about, right?

957
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:33,000
So it overcomes all their
knowledge and all their

958
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,120
intelligence.

959
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,140
It's as if I forced you to guess
in detail what's in the

960
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,200
back of the room if something
new was there.

961
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,310
And you go, there's no way.

962
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:41,860
I can't see.

963
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:45,180
I have no eyes in the
back of my head.

964
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,030
It's sort of like that.

965
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,120
It's as if the left half
couldn't exist.

966
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,590
The contradiction they
could note--

967
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,430
just a moment ago I told you
the other one-- they don't

968
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:56,000
notice it because something
about this neglect swallows up

969
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,350
all of your judgment.

970
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:01,110
It's beautifully phrased by some
neurologist as, it's as

971
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:03,840
if the left half could
not exist.

972
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,990
Whenever you're thinking
left, it doesn't exist.

973
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:10,650
And ironically, you have to
think left for that to work.

974
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:11,510
That's the amazing thing.

975
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:13,410
You have to go, I'm
in the middle.

976
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:13,970
There's a left.

977
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:14,520
There's a right.

978
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,630
Now, the left doesn't exist.

979
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,000
And it couldn't exist.

980
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,320
And every hint I get that it
does exist, like there's food

981
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,995
on that side or the pages
usually go all the way here

982
00:38:24,995 --> 00:38:28,110
and makes the sentences make
sense, it all disappears on

983
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:30,200
you because it couldn't
possibly exist.

984
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,700
And the neat thing about
that is it's striking

985
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,380
neurologically.

986
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,810
But that means in our own heads
as we go around, we're

987
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:39,330
constructing the world this way,
building up two separate

988
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:42,230
sides of our brain that are
gluing together a picture of

989
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,560
the world around us.

990
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,620
And these patients lose
that glue on one

991
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,370
side of their brain.

992
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:48,410
Is that OK?

993
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:49,160
Here's another version.

994
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,800
It's less flashy, but
it's the same idea.

995
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,120
Now, neglect can't
get small enough.

996
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,650
If you make something
very tiny, then you

997
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:57,810
don't ignore the left.

998
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:59,700
Once it gets tiny enough,
you can't do it.

999
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,690
So they took advantage
of that.

1000
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:02,680
And they show cloud like
stimulus of these.

1001
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,350
But they didn't show
them like this.

1002
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:05,880
They only had a slit.

1003
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:10,090
So you only saw the cloud
a bit at a time.

1004
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:12,650
And you see one cloud, and then
you see another cloud.

1005
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,870
Perhaps you'd see this cloud
go by, and you see

1006
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:15,720
this cloud go by.

1007
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,580
And your job was to say were
they identical clouds or not?

1008
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,550
And if they were not identical,
on which side do

1009
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,210
they differ?

1010
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:26,340
So because of all your visual
experiences through the slit--

1011
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:29,850
which is too small for
neglect to happen--

1012
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:32,380
what you do is you create in
your mind's eye what does that

1013
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:35,720
whole cloud look like as it
passed through the slit in

1014
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,990
your mind's eye?

1015
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:38,210
And then, you see another one.

1016
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,690
And you put that up in
your mind's eye.

1017
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:41,410
And you compare these two
things that are in your

1018
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:43,510
imagination in your
mind's eyes.

1019
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:46,280
And what happens is if these two
things differ on the left

1020
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:51,830
side, the patients rarely can
make that distinction.

1021
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:53,260
It's not because they
can't see it.

1022
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:55,110
It's always in that
narrow slit.

1023
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:57,620
But once they put the pieces
together, they put it up in

1024
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:00,580
their mind, the left half
disappears on them in their

1025
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:03,420
mind's eyes.

1026
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:09,060
So here's an experimental
approach to think about what

1027
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,660
might be going wrong
in these patients.

1028
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:15,250
So they used a very simple task,
which is when a light

1029
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,520
comes on, you push a button.

1030
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,740
That's all the task is.

1031
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:20,030
Any light comes on,
you push a button.

1032
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,440
And sometimes, they'll
put an arrow.

1033
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,700
And sometimes, you have
no information.

1034
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,740
The light comes on on the
left or the right.

1035
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,910
And sometimes, they'll put on
an arrow in the middle that

1036
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:31,445
will warn you whether the light
is likely to come on in

1037
00:40:31,445 --> 00:40:33,230
the left or the right.

1038
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,800
So sometimes, you have
neutral things.

1039
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,970
You get a cross in the middle.

1040
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:37,220
Then, a light comes on.

1041
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,030
You don't have to say
left and right.

1042
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,820
You just push a button when
one of those goes on.

1043
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:42,250
Sometimes, he gets an error
that's called valid that, 80%

1044
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:45,002
of the time if it's pointing
this way, it will turn out on

1045
00:40:45,002 --> 00:40:47,150
that side, 80% it will
turn on this side.

1046
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,970
So 80% of the time,
it's honest.

1047
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:51,170
And 20% of the time,
it's dishonest.

1048
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:53,610
So here's what it looks like.

1049
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:56,840
You're looking here at
a computer display.

1050
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,010
That thing disappears.

1051
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:01,060
And then, either an
x is here or here.

1052
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:01,730
And you push a button.

1053
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:02,320
That's all.

1054
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,910
Or a light comes on, and
you just push a button.

1055
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:04,410
That's all.

1056
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:07,420
If it came on on the left or
the right, I push button.

1057
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:10,600
When an arrow appears, 80% of
the time it's warning you

1058
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,130
where that light will appear.

1059
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:18,600
20%, it's dishonest and it
appears on the opposite side.

1060
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,620
So you will know, how good an
experimental psychologist you

1061
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:24,610
are right now, if I ask you
which condition do you think

1062
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:28,110
you're the fastest to push the
button, when you have an arrow

1063
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,930
that's truly telling you where
the light will come on, an

1064
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:33,610
arrow that's misleading
you, or an x

1065
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:34,430
that tells you nothing?

1066
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:37,430
Which do you think you'll
be fastest?

1067
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:38,450
PROFESSOR: Where the arrow's
pointing, right?

1068
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:40,290
Like, here's the answer,
over here!

1069
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,620
OK, thank you very much.

1070
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:44,820
Which do you think you'll
be slowest on?

1071
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,390
The dishonest arrow, right?

1072
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:48,510
The arrow says, look over
here, look over here!

1073
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,520
And you're looking over there.

1074
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,130
And you go, oh no!

1075
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:50,890
It came on the other side.

1076
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:52,960
You lied to me!

1077
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,790
And the x is the middle.

1078
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:54,720
And here's the data.

1079
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,740
And it's a very simple
experiment, right?

1080
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,610
How fast are you?

1081
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:59,220
This is reaction time just
to push a button

1082
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,370
when it comes on.

1083
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:03,010
Here's the neutral condition
in the middle.

1084
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:06,730
You're a little bit faster
if it's an honest arrow.

1085
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:07,930
You're a little bit
slower if it's a

1086
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:10,350
dishonest, misleading arrow.

1087
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:13,920
So now, you do this
exact experiment.

1088
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,800
And I'll show you the data.

1089
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,850
And then, I'll simplify it for
you with patients who have

1090
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:22,590
right sided damage, left
sided neglect.

1091
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:25,790
And you can see as you look at
these lines that the arrow can

1092
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:27,750
be honest or dishonest,
and it can be on the

1093
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,400
left or right side.

1094
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,040
Now, if you were always bad on
the neglected side, you go,

1095
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,170
well, that's not
a big surprise.

1096
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:34,450
But here's a surprise.

1097
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:36,550
Patients were only bad--

1098
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:40,950
the times were way up here only
when they had a dishonest

1099
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:43,970
arrow that sent them into
their good side.

1100
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:45,490
That's when they were
really bad.

1101
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:47,130
So let's take a look
at this again.

1102
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:48,780
So here's the bad side.

1103
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,070
Here's the good side.

1104
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:53,330
When that arrow comes on
that's honest, good.

1105
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:57,990
When an arrow comes on that's
honest this way, they do fine.

1106
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:59,400
That's their bad field,
but they do fine.

1107
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,810
Tiny bit slower, but
just a tiny bit.

1108
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:04,800
Arrow comes on that moves them
into their bad field but

1109
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,930
really the light is on
here, they do fine.

1110
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:10,970
But if an arrow sends them into
their good field, then

1111
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:14,295
they're really, really slow
to get back here.

1112
00:43:14,295 --> 00:43:17,210
So Posner argued that when you
move your attention in the

1113
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:20,150
world, you have three steps
you have to do.

1114
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:22,270
You have to disengage your
attention from where you're

1115
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:23,710
paying attention,
just logically.

1116
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:25,340
I'm paying attention
here right now.

1117
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:26,420
I'm going to pay attention
over here.

1118
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:29,600
I have to pull myself up from
here, move my attention over

1119
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,540
here, and then focus here.

1120
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:34,300
So you disengage, get out from
where you are, move to where

1121
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,920
you need to go, and land
and then focus

1122
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,300
what you want to do.

1123
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:40,600
And the only condition where
they're bad is where they have

1124
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,680
to get their attention out of
the good field as if once

1125
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,460
they're in that good field, once
their mind is landed in

1126
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,660
that good field, they're
in quicksand.

1127
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:51,100
And it's going to be really hard
to get their attention to

1128
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,470
move into the bad field.

1129
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:54,520
So think about this.

1130
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,930
The clocks are perfect for this
because when you draw a

1131
00:43:57,930 --> 00:43:59,390
clock mostly--

1132
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:00,900
think about that as
intuitively--

1133
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,460
if I was to ask you to draw the
numbers on a clock, you

1134
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,320
start with a 12 typically.

1135
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,070
Then, what's the next
one you would draw?

1136
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:11,180
One, because that's how we're
taught to do clocks.

1137
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:13,330
Disaster if you have neglect.

1138
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:15,110
You're in the good field.

1139
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:18,550
Now, the left half of the clock
has disappeared on you

1140
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:21,950
because the clock has made you
land your attention on the

1141
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,260
good field.

1142
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,730
And now, you can't
pull out of it.

1143
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:29,350
But what happens if you only
have to draw 8 o'clock?

1144
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:31,930
Your attention never got moved
into the good field.

1145
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:34,200
It's just starting from
middle, so to speak.

1146
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,980
And this very same patient can
draw the 8 o'clock or 10

1147
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:38,220
o'clock pretty well.

1148
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,710
Does that makes sense?

1149
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:43,340
Because they never got stuck
in the good field.

1150
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,400
They only moved into
the bad field.

1151
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,340
They can move into
the bad field.

1152
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:51,040
And so if their eyes are
closed, that's better.

1153
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,260
They get less stuck.

1154
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,630
And now, we understand
this thing.

1155
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:56,210
Why is it these patients, if
both fingers are moving--

1156
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:58,230
because once their attention is
drawn into the good field,

1157
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:00,160
it's as if the bad field
disappeared on them.

1158
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,370
But if they only get stimulated
in the bad field,

1159
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:08,820
so right side here, then they're
OK because they never

1160
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:11,580
paid that much attention
to the good field.

1161
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:12,445
So this is a nice experiment.

1162
00:45:12,445 --> 00:45:14,240
It shows you what
is the problem.

1163
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,100
The problem is once you're
paying attention to the good

1164
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:20,730
field, the normal, healthy
field, it's so powerful

1165
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:22,500
compared to the weakened
representation here, that you

1166
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,440
never leave it because it just
seems like everything.

1167
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,980

1168
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:29,420
Now, here's a clever one.

1169
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:32,620
Again, this shows you how much
of attention is created by our

1170
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:36,570
minds as opposed to just
simply defined by the

1171
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:37,410
environment.

1172
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:41,350
So what if you show a display
to somebody with neglect and

1173
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:45,850
then rotate the display right
in front of them?

1174
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:47,860
So initially, the neglect is
going to be on the left side.

1175
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:50,520
But imagine the thing is turning
over like this, right

1176
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,460
in front of them.

1177
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:55,590
Will the neglect travel with
the initial assignment?

1178
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:57,790
So this is from Marlene
Behrmann, a very clever

1179
00:45:57,790 --> 00:45:58,370
experiment.

1180
00:45:58,370 --> 00:45:59,530
They have to pay attention
if the light

1181
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:00,930
comes on here or here.

1182
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:03,180
But what they do is while the
experiment's going on, right

1183
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:06,000
in front of you, it slowly
rotates over to here.

1184
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,300
And sure enough, then
the light comes on.

1185
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:13,180
Sure enough, the neglect now
moves into the good field

1186
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:15,509
because once you've assigned
left and right, you

1187
00:46:15,509 --> 00:46:17,300
know this is left.

1188
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:18,840
So OK, you turn it over.

1189
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,340
That's still really left.

1190
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:22,340
But think how weird that is.

1191
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:23,790
The mind is deciding that.

1192
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:26,720
In an absolute sense, this
thing is on the right.

1193
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,600
But the mind said, this
is the leftward one.

1194
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,780
And you can flip it over, but
you're not tricking me.

1195
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:33,940
I know it's on the left, and
I'm considering it the

1196
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:35,360
leftward one.

1197
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,370
The mind is deciding what
counts as left and

1198
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:40,830
right, not the world.

1199
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:44,370
And what other kinds of
information is being processed

1200
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:47,190
that's not reaching
attention levels?

1201
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:50,070
So here's a cute experiment.

1202
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:53,930
They would say to these
patients, any difference

1203
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:55,200
between these two things?

1204
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,940
No.

1205
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,920
But if you had to live in one of
these houses, which one do

1206
00:46:58,920 --> 00:46:59,580
you think you'd live?

1207
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:00,170
Well, I don't know.

1208
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:00,800
They're pretty much the same.

1209
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,460
Why would I pick one?

1210
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:02,810
Well, pick one!

1211
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:04,900
They go, ah, this looks like a
little better place to live if

1212
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:06,280
I have to pick one.

1213
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,690
Which vase do you want?

1214
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:08,070
I don't know.

1215
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:08,880
They look the same.

1216
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:09,590
You have to pick.

1217
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:11,350
I pick this one.

1218
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:13,180
Which glass to drink from?

1219
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:14,140
You have to pick.

1220
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:14,430
Pick this one.

1221
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:17,640
So they consciously are not
aware of what's going on here

1222
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,560
when there's information to
the opposite side to draw

1223
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,410
their attention.

1224
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:22,570
But something in their mind
somewhere is picking up

1225
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:23,670
information.

1226
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:25,870
So the last question-- and I'll
show you a final video--

1227
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:26,690
is this.

1228
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:29,450
What kind of information is
picked up in the neglected

1229
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:33,700
field as you decide, some part
of your mind, to neglect it?

1230
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:38,240
So imagine if I showed
you two forks versus

1231
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,490
a fork and a spoon.

1232
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:42,520

1233
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:45,710
In order for that to make a
difference whether you report

1234
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:47,890
both are present-- so again,
if you have a right sided

1235
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:50,480
lesion, you might tend not to
report this fork or not to

1236
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,250
report this key.

1237
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:55,650
If you just don't report either
one, OK, left is left

1238
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:56,870
and you're bad at reporting
that one.

1239
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:58,650
There's something competing
in the good field.

1240
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:02,560
Your attention gets drawn
here, hard to disengage.

1241
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:06,690
But if it makes a difference
what this thing is, that means

1242
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:09,920
that your mind kind of
knows what it is.

1243
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,980
And your mind is saying, well,
if it's a key, that's

1244
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:15,930
different enough that I can
still pay attention to it.

1245
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:19,240
But if it's another fork, those
are really similar.

1246
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,820
And now, my mind is really
sucked into this fork.

1247
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:24,020
But in order for that to make a
difference, do you see that

1248
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:26,650
you have to know somewhere in
your mind what's different on

1249
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:28,680
the left for that to affect
your performance?

1250
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,880
So now, we'll see a video of
a patient, the last one.

1251
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:36,270
This is a neurologist, Bob
Rafal, and a patient.

1252
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:39,150
It's a hugely nice thing of the
patients, most of all, but

1253
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:41,590
also the physicians to make
these tapes available for

1254
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:42,840
teaching purposes.

1255
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:48,920

1256
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,380
So you understand--

1257
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:52,420
just review for one month
and we're done--

1258
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:55,470
that when the same object came
up, did he pretty much notice

1259
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:57,730
the one on the bad side and
the right side for him?

1260
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:58,600
No.

1261
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,840
Same object, he almost
always said it's one.

1262
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,850
If they're different objects, he
typically reported slightly

1263
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:06,560
sluggishly the one
on his bad side.

1264
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:10,340
That means part of his mind has
to know what the object is

1265
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:14,700
so that he ignores it if it's
identical and he reports it if

1266
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:15,300
it's different.

1267
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,390
Well, you have to know
what it is to base

1268
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:18,660
your answer on that.

1269
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:22,490
Yet, the logic of neglect is
that if they're identical,

1270
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:24,710
then he's going to ignore the
one that he spotted on the

1271
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:28,300
left in part of his mind but
squashed from his awareness on

1272
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,085
the other side.

1273
00:49:29,085 --> 00:49:30,335
OK, thanks very much.

1274
00:49:30,335 --> 00:49:49,930
