PROFESSOR JOHN GABRIELI:
Good afternoon.

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,030

11
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,490
So last time we talked about
neuropsychiatric disorder.

12
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,720
And I just want to remind you
that we talked about it in a

13
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,880
couple of context
of challenges.

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,500
That historically, different
cultures at different times

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,870
have interpreted unusual
behavior in

16
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,470
very different ways.

17
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:56,310
From trephination, where you
have to release evil spirits,

18
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:02,370
to possession, to what we would
now consider brutal

19
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,430
patterns of taking
people away from

20
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,740
society who behave unusually.

21
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,230
And that even in recent times,
things like in the Soviet

22
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,720
Union, the diagnosis of people
who protest at utilitarian

23
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,410
governments is a socially
defined diagnosis.

24
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,530
Obviously things like definition
of homosexuality is

25
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,200
a psychiatric disorder until
about 20 years ago.

26
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,160
It was a socially defined
disorder.

27
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,630
So there's a lot
of challenges.

28
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,150
On the other hand, there's a lot
of people suffering with a

29
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,430
huge range of neuropsychiatric
disorders.

30
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,110
So we're going to talk some
more about that today.

31
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:40,890
Think a little bit more about
issues of treatment, talk a

32
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,840
bit about depression,
and ADHD.

33
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,260
And I think of depression and
ADHD, attention deficit

34
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:51,360
hyperactivity disorder, as
kind of different as

35
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,110
schizophrenia.

36
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,860
So most of us, except for the
1% approximately who have

37
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,030
schizophrenia, don't
hear voices, right.

38
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,750
That's an unusual thing.

39
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,920
But all of us can be sad.

40
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,080
And many children are what we
would consider to be a bit

41
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,200
hyperactive, compared to a
teenager or an adult, right.

42
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,160
They won't sit still quietly in
a large classroom like this

43
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,370
for very long.

44
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,580
And so when we talk about
disorders like these.

45
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,686
These are in some ways
exaggerations, or extensions,

46
00:02:20,686 --> 00:02:23,460
of what we consider typical
everyday behavior.

47
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,580
But moving into a realm that
makes life difficult for those

48
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,620
who get the diagnosis.

49
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,100
So when it comes to treatment,
there's sort of two giant

50
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,170
classes of them.

51
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,700
One of them is behavioral
treatment.

52
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,550
Broadly speaking, you could
call them talk therapies.

53
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:40,240
And the other one is medical
treatment with drugs.

54
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,650
Within psychotherapy, which
really covers all of the talk

55
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,230
therapies, people sometimes
make a distinction between

56
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:50,935
psychoanalysis and cognitive
behavioral therapy, or CBT.

57
00:02:50,935 --> 00:02:53,470

58
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,140
So what is psychological
therapy?

59
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,910
So you might have a sense that
there's a lot of organization,

60
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,030
and rules, and regulations
about this.

61
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,040
But the truth of the matter is
that psychotherapy is a social

62
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,960
interaction in which a trained
professional tries to help

63
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,890
another person behave and
feel differently.

64
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,920
There's really no boundaries
on that.

65
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,160
OK.

66
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,530
There's no official rules.

67
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,020
There's more and less official
channels we're used to.

68
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,000
But it can be a very wide
sources of this.

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,470
And if you flip open--

70
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,450
this is an archaic thing--
yellow pages.

71
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,460
I realize a few years ago
people, yellow pages.

72
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,850
But they used to have things
called phones and phone books

73
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,420
that were tethered
to the wall.

74
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,300
And this is where you would
look for information about

75
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,870
people who list themselves as
providing psychotherapy.

76
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,980
All you have to do is put your
name in that listing, even

77
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,840
easier on the internet maybe.

78
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,560
A psychiatrist, the big
difference between

79
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,110
psychiatrist in one practical
sense and psychologist is

80
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,440
psychiatrist of course,
go to medical school.

81
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,350
And they have prescription
privileges.

82
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,290
They can write prescriptions
for drugs.

83
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:52,260
That's rare to nonexistent
currently among psychologists.

84
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,800
Psychoanalyst, here's Sigmund
Freud in the original

85
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,120
psychotherapy couch.

86
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,610
And I think we've barely
mentioned Freud so far in this

87
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,690
course, right?

88
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,530
Which is kind of a big
shock to many people.

89
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,200
You might have thought coming
into this course that there'd

90
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,870
be Freud, Freud, Freud.

91
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,880
And you know, that we would be
sitting there and that we'd be

92
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,670
discussing ideas about
Freudian theory.

93
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,630
I'll come back to that
in a moment.

94
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,560
Clinical psychologists can
provide psychotherapy.

95
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,269
Counseling psychologists in
schools, clinical social

96
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:26,970
workers, clergy, peer groups,
self-help books.

97
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,540
So let me just return to Freud
just for a moment.

98
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,070
Because intellectually, I think
most people will agree

99
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,100
that Freud was a giant mind.

100
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,740
And that in many ways, the
complexity of the modern human

101
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,630
mind, the idea that we're made
up of different parts,

102
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,580
different feelings, that we're
not just one simple operation

103
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,050
machine, but that we have
conflicts, different feelings,

104
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,560
and thoughts, and patterns
all within us.

105
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,650
Freud probably articulated that
thought more powerfully

106
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,910
than anybody else in many ways,
as a modern way in which

107
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,020
we view people, right.

108
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,330
People are not just
simple things.

109
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,840
They're complicated things, full
of tensions and desires.

110
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,420
They're all mixed together.

111
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,720
At the same time, the specific
ideas that Freud articulated

112
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,480
using psychodynamic theories
like free association,

113
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,250
resistance, transference,
interpretation, trying to have

114
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,250
a corrective emotional
experience, where you go back

115
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,360
to your youth and
you figure out

116
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,360
something bad that happened.

117
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,250
And if you can somehow grapple
with that, that will let you

118
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:28,030
be free of the consequences
of that early experience.

119
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,740
Almost none of that has
withstood the scrutiny of

120
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,550
practical science.

121
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,180
A lot of it, you don't
even know how you

122
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,910
could begin to test.

123
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,050
Now for those of you who become
physicians, and the

124
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,790
rest of you will be patients,
it's amazing how much of

125
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,690
medicine is not science-based.

126
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,510
It's amazing.

127
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,940
So you hear the cry all the time
in medicine, we need to

128
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,920
have science, or evidence-based
medicine.

129
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,090
And you might have thought,
well, what

130
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,000
else are they doing?

131
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,380
OK.

132
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,570
And the answer is they're
treated as best they can and

133
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,420
what works, works.

134
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,150
A lot of stuff they don't
understand exactly when and

135
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,900
why it works.

136
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,520
But they apply what they can.

137
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,310
There's a patient in distress.

138
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:08,170
Freudian ideas are everything
that you know about ids, and

139
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,530
electric complexes, and all
that kinds of stuff.

140
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:14,620
Hard to prove that they exist
in any scientific sense.

141
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,830
So weirdly, Freud is in many
ways marginalized in the

142
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,820
current scientific psychology.

143
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,030
That doesn't mean he wasn't a
creative mind that influenced

144
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:26,200
the way people think about the
human mind, and treating the

145
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,380
human mind.

146
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,060
But the specific ideas he has
are in many ways at the edge

147
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,350
of the field.

148
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:38,060
So more central to the field
is work called cognitive

149
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,470
behavioral therapy, or CBT.

150
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,330
This is Aaron Beck,
who's maybe the

151
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,960
foremost figure in that.

152
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,450
And that CBT was developed to
be exactly the opposite in

153
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,420
many senses of psychoanalysis.

154
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,170
So similar because it's about
behavior, and about the

155
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:54,310
interaction between a clinician
and a person seeking

156
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,380
a sort of happier, healthier
approach to things.

157
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,290
But the Woody Allen version of
psychotherapy, where you go

158
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:05,530
for 40 years weekly to your
psychiatrist on the west side

159
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,200
and talk through your
problems, OK.

160
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,880
That idea, people said, well,
that's fine if you do that.

161
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,780
But is that really what we mean
by treating somebody?

162
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:17,130
So Beck said, in things like
anxiety or depression, people

163
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:20,080
have dysfunctional beliefs that
the world is threatening,

164
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,720
that the world is hopeless.

165
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,210
These are sort of logical
thinking errors that you can

166
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,710
work yourself out of to make
yourself less depressed or

167
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,010
less anxious.

168
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,790
That you should focus not on
childhood causes of what

169
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,250
happened, but on current
problems you face day-to-day

170
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,610
and how to grapple with them.

171
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:39,190
Develop strategies that don't
make you get down and

172
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,510
depressed, or fearful
and anxious.

173
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,220
And that it should
be time limited.

174
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,720
Eight weeks or something, from
beginning to end period, not

175
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,900
an endless review of your life
and roots of your life.

176
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,960
And so people are like that
because of part, it's easy to

177
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,630
test in research studies.

178
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,980
It's been shown to be pretty
effective, pretty much on a

179
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,220
par with medications
in most studies.

180
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,910
And in some cases, better.

181
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,350
And a psychoanalysis
could go forever.

182
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,490
It's hard to experimentally
test that in many ways.

183
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,170
So there was questions about
whether psychotherapy works.

184
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,480
And if you're kind of a
scientist, you kind of like

185
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,080
biological stuff like pills,
not talking, right.

186
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,040
Although talk is
very powerful.

187
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,230
And now, and early on,
people say, well,

188
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,190
maybe it's all baloney.

189
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,350
And I would say that starting
around 1980 from this review,

190
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,130
people said, no, there's
a lot to it.

191
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,040
Although not everything
we wish it did.

192
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,610
So they performed
a meta-analysis.

193
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,130
You may have heard of these
kinds of things.

194
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,659
Where it was a quantitative
method for averaging results

195
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:36,159
of a large number of
different studies.

196
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,890
The ideas is that statistically,
if you combined

197
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,039
many different studies, you
might have a sort of an

198
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,890
overall picture.

199
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,100
It's not just describing them,
but taking their actual

200
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,820
statistics and combining them.

201
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,440
Looking for the effect size,
something about the consistent

202
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,040
size of, in this case, a
psychotherapy treatment.

203
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,000
And then asking what happens
in the terms

204
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,290
of the effect size.

205
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,430
And you come out with a picture

206
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,840
like this in the study.

207
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,720
That you have an average effect
side of a 0.7 that is

208
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,310
treated people.

209
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,870
This is getting better
this way.

210
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,610
We're on average better across
many different studies.

211
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,270
So the treatment seemed
to move people

212
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,310
in the right direction.

213
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:13,730
And that furthermore, about half
receiving psychotherapy,

214
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,730
the average person was better
off than 80% of the people who

215
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:17,370
didn't get it.

216
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,940
So not everybody benefits
greatly.

217
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,680
But many people benefit some.

218
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,740
About 10% got worse.

219
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,076
So this number says only
a few get worse.

220
00:09:26,076 --> 00:09:29,120
A weirdly different thing, was
that people have always want

221
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,590
to develop very clear ideas
about which forms, of many

222
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:35,360
possible forms of behavioral
therapy are really powerful

223
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,630
for which difficulty, or
which kind of person.

224
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,790
It makes sense, right?

225
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,580
That the different problem
you're facing and the kind of

226
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,760
person you are, a different
kind of talk therapy,

227
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,420
different kind of CBT would
be powerful for you.

228
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,020
And that's been incredibly
hard to

229
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,310
demonstrate in most cases.

230
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,330
Shockingly hard to
demonstrate.

231
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,680
And part of that comes from
these kinds of studies.

232
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,610
So the best of these kinds
of studies have random

233
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,780
assignments and to different
kinds of treatment.

234
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,010
For psychotherapy, you might
have a wait list.

235
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,930
And you could be blinded as to
getting a good or bad version.

236
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,450
So again, here's another
meta-analysis.

237
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,900
And here's the kind
of big surprise.

238
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,450
Again in this next
meta-analysis, about 2:1

239
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,820
chance of improving, versus
control, if you sit there and

240
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,460
don't do anything.

241
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,560
So that's again, a good way to
go if you're in distress.

242
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,610
Here's kind of a surprise,
credentials don't matter,

243
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:26,000
Ph.D., M.D., no degree.

244
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,970
There might be something about
the kind of person who's a

245
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,610
more or less effective
therapists.

246
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,230
That's been hard to
scientifically demonstrate.

247
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,570
The degree you have has never
correlated with the

248
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,210
effectiveness of
the treatment.

249
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,110
Here's another big surprise,
the experience of the

250
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,450
therapist didn't matter.

251
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:43,700
Beginning, middle, end of
career, seen a lot of

252
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,400
patients, not seen a lot of
patients, that doesn't

253
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,620
consistently matter.

254
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,970
The type of therapy doesn't
consistently matter.

255
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:53,220
The length of therapy doesn't
matter in any way that people

256
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,910
have been able to show
scientifically.

257
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:58,660
What seems to matter is talking
to somebody who

258
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,560
listens to you on a
consistent basis.

259
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:01,870
Yeah?

260
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,702
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

261
00:11:04,702 --> 00:11:06,280
PROFESSOR JOHN GABRIELI: That's
for all these kinds of

262
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:06,940
things, right.

263
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,810
So on the one hand, you wouldn't
want to push it to an

264
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,610
absurdest thing because there
are humans involved.

265
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,130
You wouldn't want to say, well,
just for fun, let's take

266
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:16,180
somebody's who like a
three-year-old and send them

267
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,480
out to see what they
can do, right.

268
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,400
So I mean, there's a real
person involved

269
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,650
here in real distress.

270
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,010
But whenever they've
done these kinds of

271
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:22,950
things, they adjusted--

272
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,600
And CBT is the most consistently
studied because

273
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,960
it's very organized.

274
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,080
Psychotherapy, so many people
do so differently.

275
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,120
It's very hard to study.

276
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,760
And CBT is time-limited.

277
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,560
So that approach seems more
practical in some senses to

278
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,140
people's minds.

279
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,560
So most of the research on
behavioral therapy is focused

280
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,940
on CBT, but not exclusively.

281
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,090
But people never been able to
show that these things matter.

282
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,910
Maybe there is something about
the bedside manner so to

283
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,750
speak, of the clinitioner or the
person who talks with you.

284
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:56,150
But that's never been extracted
rigorously.

285
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,190
And then the other approach of
course is many different kinds

286
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:01,280
of medications that you read
about or hear about or

287
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,920
experience all the time.

288
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,560
It turned out, let me just say
it were, to be extraordinarily

289
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,560
hard to develop medications
for psychiatric diseases.

290
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,170
There's been a number that
have mostly been

291
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,880
discovered by accident.

292
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,260
Most of these were medications
developed for something else,

293
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,920
they kind of stumbled
on as useful

294
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,810
for psychiatric disorders.

295
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,990
In the last 20 years as people
have developed drugs more

296
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:25,510
systematically, it's been
brutally hard to develop drugs

297
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,640
for psychiatric disorders.

298
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,330
There's hardly been any major
new ones in the last 10 years.

299
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,970
And many pharmaceutical
companies are now abandoning

300
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,580
their current research programs
because they just

301
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,380
don't feel they're making
any traction on it.

302
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,840
So it's been really,
really hard.

303
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,000
I mean the mind and brain
is just so complicated.

304
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,650
And so you get all kinds of
partly political debates about

305
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,810
people who are concerned about
what's right for children.

306
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,940
Are we giving kids
too many drugs?

307
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,140
Of course, you're never
going to have a

308
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,570
scientific answer to that.

309
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,120
Some kids probably get
too many drugs.

310
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,230
Some kids probably
don't get enough.

311
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,530
We'll come back and
talk about ADHD.

312
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:06,800
So let's people let's pick for
a moment one disorder.

313
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,740
And then we'll pick OCD,
obsessive compulsive disorder.

314
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:14,060
So it's a kind of an anxiety
disorder that features

315
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,010
obsessions, recurrent
unwanted thoughts.

316
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,660
People are drawn to patterns
of thought that they don't

317
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,620
want to over and over again.

318
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,290
So the obsessions are mental
patterns of thought.

319
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,780
The compulsions are physical
repetitive behaviors, like

320
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,530
endless hand-washing, counting,

321
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,380
checking, and cleaning.

322
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,190
Done with such intensity and
ferocity that the person's

323
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,730
really trapped by these.

324
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:38,060
So let me show you one example
of an individual patient

325
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,070
describing her experience.

326
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,620
So the thing with these
disorders is we sometimes say

327
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,610
somebody's a little OCD because
they like to be extra

328
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:53,060
careful to brush their teeth
four times a day.

329
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,590
But in these cases, these

330
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,120
individuals are really trapped.

331
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,150
I mean they have a hard time
leaving their house, a hard

332
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:01,900
time functioning socially,
hard time getting jobs.

333
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,960
So people wonder, what's the
most helpful treatment?

334
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,350
And here's a example of a study
looking at how many

335
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,170
symptoms you have with OCD.

336
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:14,650
And these are individuals who
get, in blue, placebo.

337
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,920
So it's good to be low.

338
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,350
In green, a medication that's
used for the disorder.

339
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,860
And then these colors are
getting behavioral treatment,

340
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,480
or behavioral treatment
plus medication.

341
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,760
So at least in this context
for example, behavioral

342
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,705
treatment is more effective by
itself than the medication.

343
00:14:30,705 --> 00:14:33,970
It would be easy to tell you
oh, there's a rule for

344
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,200
different disorders, that it's
behavioral treatment or

345
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:36,810
medication.

346
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,600
But it turns out on average,
it just vary considerably

347
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,250
depending on the medication,
depending on the particular

348
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,380
patients you see.

349
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,055
There's no real understanding
yet of which patient should

350
00:14:46,055 --> 00:14:49,430
get which treatment under
what circumstances.

351
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,530
And here is some evidence
suggesting that if you get

352
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,790
medication only, this is the
percent who relapsed.

353
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,050
So a concern is there's active
treatment phase .

354
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,240
And how many people slide back
into the difficulty,

355
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,450
medication-only.

356
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:03,350
About half the people are
relapsing about a year later.

357
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,660
But if they get this sort of
behavioral treatment, there

358
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,000
sort of seems to be more
sustained benefits.

359
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,060
So people are thinking that
might be important.

360
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,850
And then people wonder, if we
treat your mind by behavioral

361
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:19,780
therapy, if we treat your brain
by drugs, now we're

362
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,210
going to reject that
distinction.

363
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,690
OK.

364
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,970
When I talk to you, if you
happen to remember anything I

365
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:26,440
say, I'm changing your brain.

366
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,220
OK.

367
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:31,170
Talk, or experience, or
thoughts, or imagination

368
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:34,180
change your brain as
much as any medical

369
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,190
substance does, right.

370
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:38,130
So it's a wrong way to think,
like the drugs change the

371
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,070
brain and the talk
changes the mind.

372
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,280
To change your mind is
to change your brain.

373
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,760
So but any case, you could ask
whether these forms of

374
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,090
treatment, in what ways are they
similar or dissimilar?

375
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:49,780
So here's PET scans of
patients with OCD

376
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,350
pre and post treatment.

377
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,180
And you can see that there's
sort of activation in the

378
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:58,030
basal ganglia in the caudate
that looks pretty similar

379
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:01,580
across the treatments, as if
both treatments were working

380
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:05,470
on that over activation
of the basal ganglia.

381
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:08,770
On the other hand, here's
looking at CBT and drug

382
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,550
treatment for depression.

383
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,830
And you can see these pictures
with these blue areas, and

384
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:16,000
these with these red areas, the
brain changes in response

385
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,420
to treatment, look
very different.

386
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,240
So there's no simple answer
about whether behavioral

387
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,060
therapy and drug therapy change
the same or different

388
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,150
things to help people.

389
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:29,450
Depends on the disorder,
depends on the drug.

390
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,510
And we just have a lot more
to learn about that.

391
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:34,380
But both of those things affect
the brain and can be

392
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,250
effective to help people.

393
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,720
So let's focus on depression
a little bit.

394
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,070
These are people with depression
who feel fearful,

395
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,510
gloomy, helpless, hopeless
in an extreme way.

396
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:46,450
So it's difficult to get out of
bed, difficult to do work,

397
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,800
relate to people.

398
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,940
Literature, Hamlet's description
of how weary,

399
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,830
stale, flat, and unprofitable
seem to me all the uses of

400
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:56,390
this world, describes often what
people with depression

401
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,390
roughly describe their
experiences like.

402
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,780
A typical episode,
it varies widely.

403
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,599
It's about 4 to 12 months
if untreated of intense

404
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,680
depression.

405
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:10,220
A pervasive dysphoria, just
sort of inability to feel

406
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,200
pleasure and intense
mental pain,

407
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,599
generalized loss of interest.

408
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:18,089
It's estimated to sometimes
affected some 5% of the

409
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:19,020
world's population.

410
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,300
That's a huge number
of individuals.

411
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,180
Average age of onset is 30.

412
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:28,390
But it goes across wide ages,
often unnoticed in children.

413
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,750
People are picking this up
more than they used to.

414
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,740
They used to think there's a
thought that children can't

415
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,380
really be depressed.

416
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,310
It's hard to know why that
happened exactly.

417
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:39,770
Psychiatric ideas are typically
developed in adults.

418
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,270
And it takes a while
for the field to

419
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,570
recognize them in children.

420
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,200
But it's rare to have a first
depressive episode after 60.

421
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,815
It's rare to have gone your life
and then get depression

422
00:17:48,815 --> 00:17:51,360
in older age.

423
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,480
Kind of mysteriously at the
moment, women have depression

424
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,040
at two or three times the rate
of men in the United States,

425
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,730
and pretty much throughout
the world at a two

426
00:17:58,730 --> 00:17:59,660
to threefold increase.

427
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,470
That's a pretty big one.

428
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,690
We'll talk later about ADHD.

429
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,875
There the numbers
kind of reverse.

430
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:08,130
It's 2 to 3 times more frequent
in boys than girls.

431
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,270
And about 70% of people who
will have one episode of

432
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,110
depression will have another
one later on.

433
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,990

434
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:19,720
So the diagnosis in the DSM book
requires at least three

435
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,020
of the following for a period.

436
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,170
Now what I wanted to give you
a feeling if you think about

437
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:26,230
this, you know you are the
doctor talking to somebody.

438
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,510
And you know, disturbed sleep,
but how disturbed

439
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,260
does it have to be?

440
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,770
Diminished appetite, but
how diminish, right?

441
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:32,590
Loss of energy?

442
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,850
Well, we all have periods where
we're more sluggish or

443
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,640
more focused, right?

444
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,590
I mean so usually depression,
these things are so extreme.

445
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,540
It's very obvious.

446
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,070
Sometimes it's at the edge.

447
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:44,090
And there's a range
of these things.

448
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,830
We know there's a genetic
predisposition.

449
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:49,950
If you have identical twins
50%, dizygotic 10%.

450
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,610
But we know there's
environmental factors.

451
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:55,820
So it's very hard to figure
out whether diseases are

452
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,700
getting more or less
common over time.

453
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,760
Because especially in
psychiatric diseases, the

454
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,350
criteria that defines those
diseased change over time.

455
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,725
So you don't know which it
is, sensitivity to it.

456
00:19:06,725 --> 00:19:08,420
You know, 30 years ago teachers

457
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,320
never heard of autism.

458
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,850
Now every teacher in
kindergarten is watching out

459
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:14,900
for autism.

460
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,470
So it's spotted much more
quickly and consistently.

461
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,250
So people say it's going up.

462
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,280
Is it really going up?

463
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,230
Is it being detected
more often?

464
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,680
It's very hard to tell
those things apart.

465
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,180
But where evidence is available,
since 1940 there's

466
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,980
nearly a 10-year drop in the
average age of the first

467
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,030
instance of depression.

468
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:35,550
So is this 10-year drop that
people are getting better at

469
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,870
spotting it at adolescents,
instead of seeing an

470
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:41,130
adolescent or child as simply
moody, they're recognizing

471
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,220
depression?

472
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:46,030
Or is the increased pressures
in childhood driving

473
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,860
depression up at
an earlier age?

474
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,330
Very hard to tell.

475
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:52,950

476
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,320
So here's a video clip of some
patients describing their

477
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:01,470
experience in depression

478
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:05,190
So people have been trying to
understand by experiments,

479
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:09,170
what are the thought patterns
that are promoting depression?

480
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,440
One approach has been
this dot probe test.

481
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,650
We've talked about
that before.

482
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,420
I'll remind you in a moment
what that is.

483
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:19,130
But basically, it's to
experimentally test the idea

484
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:23,100
that there's a sort of cycle
of negative thought in

485
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,580
depression that reinforces
itself--

486
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:29,240
That you pay attention
to sad or bad things.

487
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,820
The more you think about bad
things, the worse you feel.

488
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,570
The worse you feel, the more
you think about bad things.

489
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,710
And this is sort of you know,
a downward spiral of

490
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,150
gloominess.

491
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,210
And another question that people
are very interested in

492
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:43,270
is, when you see these kind of
psychological mechanisms that

493
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:46,790
may contribute to depression,
are they there for somebody

494
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:49,600
who has never yet been
depressed, but it's a risk

495
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,660
factor for becoming depressed?

496
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,060
Or is it really a consequence
of the depression, right?

497
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,530
If you pay more attention to sad
things is that a risk for

498
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:00,220
becoming depressed
first time ever?

499
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,960
Or is that already part
of the disease process

500
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,020
itself once its hit?

501
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,120
So here's a dot probe test.

502
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,360
We talked about it before
in regards to aging.

503
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,480
You see two pictures.

504
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,480
A neutral one and a happy one.

505
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,730
They disappear.

506
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,390
A dot appears behind
one or the other.

507
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,820
And you push a button to
indicate which side it's on.

508
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,720
All you're doing is indicating
which side it's on.

509
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,280
Or you might get another pair
of faces with a negative

510
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,470
expression and a neutral
expression.

511
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:30,860
Beneath one of them, sometimes
it's a neutral,

512
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,890
sometime it's negative.

513
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,310
A dot appears.

514
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,830
And then you can look at the
response times, how quickly

515
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,390
people responded to the
dot depending on

516
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:38,970
where the face was.

517
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:43,260
And the idea is, the faster you
respond to a dot, the more

518
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:48,640
your attention was drawn to
a positive, neutral, or a

519
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,580
negative face, right.

520
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,830
Because if your attention is
sitting there already when the

521
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,960
dot appears, boom, you're
ready to go.

522
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,840
If your attention is somewhere
else, you'll

523
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,340
have a slower response.

524
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,440
And sure enough, in patients
with depression, specifically

525
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,010
for sad faces, they have
this bias response.

526
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:06,400
They tend to respond quickly
when the dot appears where the

527
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,880
negative face just has been.

528
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,460
So it's a way that there was
sort of the attention, even

529
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,720
for such a trivial thing is
drawn to the negative.

530
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,290
It sits on the negative.

531
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:19,680
And so now you can ask the
question, what about girls who

532
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,420
were born into families with
a history of depression?

533
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:27,090
So they're in a general way at
genetic risk for depression.

534
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:30,690
But they have never been
depressed themselves.

535
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,730
So now we can ask the question,
does this mode of

536
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:36,200
thinking, of dwelling on the
negative is it apparent in

537
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,190
these girls even before they
ever have depression?

538
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,600
And not all of them will.

539
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,450
But you don't yet which ones
will and which ones won't.

540
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:47,060
And sure enough, if looking at
sad or happy faces, and here

541
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:50,600
it gets pretty opposite, for the
young girls who have a low

542
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,220
likelihood of having depression,
no family history,

543
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,850
they tend to dwell on
the happy faces.

544
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,480
And for the girls who were
born in a family with

545
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,680
depression, they tend to dwell
on the negative faces.

546
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,280
So you can see this mechanism
of focusing on the negative,

547
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,250
dwelling on the negative already
even before the child

548
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:12,040
has ever a episode
of depression.

549
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,730
So just for a moment let's
discuss, does that mean it's

550
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:15,980
genetic or environmental?

551
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:23,980

552
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,280
Who are these girls who have
a high risk for getting

553
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,090
depression?

554
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,450
What does high mean?

555
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,820
Sorry to put you on the spot.

556
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,150
What does high mean?

557
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,370
They're in a family where they
have a parent with depression.

558
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,010
OK.

559
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:39,890
So you can't tell that maybe
having a parent with

560
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:42,430
depression ups the child's
focus on the negative.

561
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,400
Because they've had some
difficult things to deal with

562
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,570
in their family.

563
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:48,320
Maybe they have genes that draw
them to negative things,

564
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,210
or maybe both.

565
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,930
You can't tell that apart from
these kinds of studies.

566
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:54,440

567
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,190
Every once in while there's
sort of a success story in

568
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,140
brain sciences.

569
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:03,380
And why it's terribly important
is this, to this

570
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:06,300
day, as one of the speaker said,
there's people who think

571
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,455
psychiatric disorders are
just for sissies.

572
00:24:08,455 --> 00:24:10,090
That you just stop
being depressed.

573
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,940
Just don't listen to those
voices, right.

574
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,730
Just stop washing your hands.

575
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:17,570
And what's very confusing about
this message is for

576
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:20,760
people for example, who are
addicted to substances or have

577
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,420
alcoholism, we ask them to stop
drinking and stop taking

578
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,900
drugs, with support.

579
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,905
But we say it's, we think
it's somewhere in

580
00:24:27,905 --> 00:24:29,260
you to stop, right.

581
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,810
So with the right support,
we think it's

582
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,280
somewhere in you to stop.

583
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,095
So it's kind of hard.

584
00:24:34,095 --> 00:24:35,180
Where is that line, right?

585
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:38,900
CBT is getting people to find
ways to think so they're not

586
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,080
anxious or not depressed.

587
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,490
Again, we think it's
in them with the

588
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:42,460
right kind of support.

589
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,810
So on the one hand we ask
people to get themselves

590
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:46,520
healthier with support, right.

591
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,540
So it's kind of tricky.

592
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,410
Where is the line of
responsibility?

593
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:51,710
But I think one of the triumphs
of modern brain

594
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:55,210
imaging is to make visible the
brain basis of psychiatric

595
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:57,520
disorders on average.

596
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,675
So because there's no broken
arm, no broken leg, no tumor

597
00:25:00,675 --> 00:25:02,730
or anything like that, right.

598
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,110
That promotes discussion,
or consideration, is our

599
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:08,500
psychiatric disorders real
brain differences?

600
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,830
And I can also tell you that
unfortunately, we're not

601
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:14,860
anywhere near where a house
can put up a picture of

602
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,730
somebody's brain and say, oh,
this person's certainly has

603
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:21,870
depression, or schizophrenia,
or ADHD, or dyslexia, or any

604
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,480
difficulty that you know of.

605
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,110
Nobody can say that on the basis
of a single brain scan

606
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,150
for a single person.

607
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:27,750
We want to.

608
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,120
We're not there yet.

609
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,570
But we can see on average
differences between people who

610
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:34,010
have a diagnosis and
people who don't.

611
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:36,380
So here's a PET, positron
emission tomography, top of

612
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,960
the brain, bottom
of the brain.

613
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,790
They found less activation in
this so called subgenual

614
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,650
anterior cingulate.

615
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:45,110
The anterior cingulate is this
cortex that sits over the

616
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,450
corpus callosum.

617
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:49,540
And here in this bottom part
of the anterior cingulate,

618
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:53,180
less activation in patients
with depression

619
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,590
than control subjects.

620
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:58,870
And then, looking at structure
now, physical volume.

621
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:03,100
Also reduced volume in these
areas, in patients with both

622
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,540
unipolar and bipolar, in
this case, depression.

623
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,050
So now we have both
a structural

624
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,340
difference on average.

625
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,740
And a functional difference
on average.

626
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,160
Sometimes in psychiatry there'd
be a brain banks.

627
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,990
When patients passed
away, they'd donate

628
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:17,700
their brains to research.

629
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,175
And people said, let's go look
in this area in people who

630
00:26:20,175 --> 00:26:23,060
have passed away so we can look
at the cellular level of

631
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:23,800
what's going on there.

632
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,160
We can't see with brain imaging

633
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,440
anything close to cells.

634
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,270
But with post-mortem
analysis we can.

635
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,440
And there was a big surprise.

636
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,870
The big surprise was when they
looked in this region, there

637
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:37,720
was a reduced number of cells,
which goes with the reduced

638
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,050
the volume, and the reduced
activation.

639
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:42,310
But it was in the neurons,
it was the glial.

640
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,280
And you go glial?

641
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,840
We haven't talked about
glial for a long time.

642
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,200
You know neurons are the stuff
that compute the mind.

643
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,260
We all agree with that.

644
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,320
Glial are essential for
brain function.

645
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,050
So we don't understand
what that means.

646
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:55,350
That these patients would have
an equal number of neurons but

647
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,660
a reduced number of glial.

648
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,240
We just don't know
what that means.

649
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,340
But it was a big surprise.

650
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:03,710
And over time I think maybe
we'll think about that.

651
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,840
And furthermore, imaging
studies looking at the

652
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,300
anterior cingulate found that
if you looked at the

653
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,340
pre-treatment activity in
this brain region--

654
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,440
I'll show another example
in a moment--

655
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,410
you could see not only changes
that occur with treatment, but

656
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:19,540
that differences predicted which
patients would benefit

657
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,710
more or less for treatment.

658
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:23,480
So all these conversion areas
about the importance of the

659
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,840
anterior cingulate cortex in
depression although nobody

660
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,730
thinks that's the whole story.

661
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:32,230
That the anterior cingulate is
part of a network of areas

662
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:36,190
that are compromised
in depression.

663
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,720
And another thing that I think
is sort of an exciting

664
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,210
direction is each dot here
is an individual person.

665
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:44,380
Here's how much they improved.

666
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,810
Better is down here.

667
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,270
This is the patients who
improved the most with

668
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:50,270
treatment, the least
with CBT treatment.

669
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,850
And this is the initial
activation.

670
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:54,560
So it's telling you maybe that
these are the patients who

671
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,490
really should get CBT.

672
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:57,910
And maybe these are
the patients who

673
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,390
didn't respond so much.

674
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,910
And maybe they should get, by
the initial brain measure,

675
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,440
some other form of treatment.

676
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,340
So that's I think an exciting
areas where we could develop

677
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,950
enough understanding of
diversity among patients to

678
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:11,370
understand which patient might
benefit for which treatment.

679
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,050
But we're just at
the beginning of

680
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:15,580
that kind of knowledge.

681
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:19,180
So what about treatments
for depression?

682
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,230
In 2005, that's some years ago
now, but there's an estimated

683
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:23,110
27 million people in the US.

684
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:26,270
There's $10billion now
and more in sales.

685
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:29,380
That's to drugs or CBT forms
of treatment of depression,

686
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,360
the most common forms
of treatment.

687
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,770
Even with these treatments--

688
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:34,770
so here's the message.

689
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:37,220
Everybody agrees I think and
reasonably, that if you know

690
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,570
somebody with depression, or
you're depressed yourself, or

691
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,800
anxiety, but we're talking about
depression, getting help

692
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,540
is a good idea.

693
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,380
Many people get helped.

694
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,100
But the help is not nearly
what we wish

695
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,150
it were in the field.

696
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:50,590
So in depression, about
half of patients

697
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,270
don't achieve remission.

698
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:55,790
They still are depressed
even after medicine

699
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,490
or behavioral treatment.

700
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:59,720
And even among those who improve
a lot, there's still

701
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,820
residual symptoms.

702
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,770
It's not as if patients
typically or often escape

703
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:04,870
entirely that.

704
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:06,970
But they can improve a lot.

705
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:09,130
But the other thing is since
nobody knows which approach to

706
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:12,110
take with which patient by any
scientific evidence, it's all

707
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:12,900
trial and error.

708
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,310
So finding a good
treatment for a

709
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,630
person could take months.

710
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,810
And by then some people just
give up and don't come back.

711
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,810
Because in the throes of the
diseases, or they just figure

712
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,020
they're not going
to be helped.

713
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,400
It's all hit and miss.

714
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,760
I have a colleague in CSAIL
the computer science

715
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,660
department.

716
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,180
And we're doing research
with her.

717
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:31,230
And we say, you know, if you
go to a doctor now with

718
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:35,140
depression, or anxiety, or
social anxiety disorder, it's

719
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,600
almost completely random whether
they assign you to one

720
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,900
treatment or another within
some broad constraints.

721
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,830
There's no scientific basis
for knowing what drug you

722
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:46,920
should get, or a drug plus
CBT, or CBT only.

723
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,170
It's completely random.

724
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,660
It's depending on the
physician's background and

725
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,660
intuitions.

726
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,600
There's no scientific basis
for knowing that.

727
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,510
So there's a lot to
be discovered.

728
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,720
So sometimes people are trying
to say, well, let's compare

729
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,180
placebo treatments to a
medicine treatment, to

730
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,850
cognitive behavioral therapy.

731
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:07,390
Here's responding to treatment,
improving.

732
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,850
So better than placebo
or both drugs, about

733
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:12,530
eight weeks, and CBT.

734
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:14,810
And then at 16 weeks there's
even more of a gain.

735
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:19,140
And they look very similar on
average across patients.

736
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,860
And if you look over time now,
after the treatment is over,

737
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,750
at how many people sort of what
the long-term picture is

738
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,260
because you care about that.

739
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,850
I mean there's two things,
getting people out of crises

740
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:31,090
and then keeping your
head above water.

741
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:33,770
It seems like the group that
maintains the best response

742
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:37,500
are the people who had the
CBT over longer periods.

743
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,560
So you might say, well
why don't we just

744
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,120
give everybody CBT?

745
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,050
And part of it is not everybody
responds to that.

746
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,530
Some patients for example, with
severe depression are

747
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:45,830
talking about suicide.

748
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:48,840
You don't feel like you can wait
8 weeks or 16 weeks to

749
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,760
let a CBT process happen.

750
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,340
Some patients just don't have
the energy to go to sessions

751
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,500
and work on things.

752
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,460
And you need to rescue
them from that.

753
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:01,000
So there's all kinds of issues
about what kinds of treatment

754
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,215
ultimately are practical and
effective for patients.

755
00:31:03,215 --> 00:31:05,870

756
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:10,120
So in clinical trials when
they try a drug.

757
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,090
And I'll focus on drugs
for the moment.

758
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,520
There's a random assignment.

759
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,870
Patients with the diagnosis are
assigned either to or a

760
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,870
placebo or a drug.

761
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:20,580
The physicians are not supposed
to know what it is.

762
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,580
Response means just getting
better, which is valuable.

763
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:26,800
Remission means, that you don't
qualify for having the

764
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,440
disease anymore.

765
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,410
How people decide whether
you have depression?

766
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:32,400
They take a full history.

767
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,220
But they'll often use some
sort of rating scale.

768
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,550
One of the most common is a
Hamilton to say how severely

769
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,680
depressed are you.

770
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,750
So they can document
it at beginning.

771
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,120
Then give that to
you at the end.

772
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,470
And see how severely depressed
at the end.

773
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,880
So one thing to know that's
really interesting, and really

774
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,880
a problem from the field is
there's incredibly strong

775
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,060
placebo responses.

776
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:56,920
In many studies the placebo
responses rival the response

777
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,850
of the drug itself.

778
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:01,160
And people have had huge debates
to this day about what

779
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,630
that means.

780
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:02,880
And it's not well understood.

781
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,600

782
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,120
Some people say nobody is
getting better, that the

783
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,920
entire thing is regression to
the mean from study entry.

784
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,810
And what does that mean?

785
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:16,570
Well when people have a drug
trials for depression, they

786
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:19,490
say we want to treat people with
substantial depression.

787
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,080
That makes sense, right?

788
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,130
So you get people who are
substantially depressed.

789
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:27,640
Depression is inherently
a fluctuating disorder.

790
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,360
So from your understanding of
regression to the mean, what

791
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,280
happens to a patient when you
get them with a really bad

792
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,530
depression score?

793
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,560
What's likely to be
there score next

794
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,010
week, better or worse?

795
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:40,800
Better.

796
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,260
So you get people with really
low depression scores, you

797
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,150
just sit back, you don't
do anything.

798
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:48,980
And because it's a fluctuating
disorder, the chances are that

799
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:51,340
because you're getting them at
low points in, they're going

800
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,320
to get better next week.

801
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:52,750
OK.

802
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,390
That's not a treatment effect.

803
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:57,670
That's, you're getting at them
at a low moment by definition.

804
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:00,310
So some people say, wow, these
studies could be full of that.

805
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,900
We say, wow, look at
this drug effect.

806
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,900
Man, let's push it up.

807
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,240
Yeah, That's because you're
getting people

808
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,420
at their worst moment.

809
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,480
They're going to go back
to their average,

810
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,380
which will be better.

811
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,670
Or another really interesting
thing is could our brains have

812
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:15,280
incredibly powerful responses
to placebos?

813
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:19,930
Do we have in us naturally
occurring healing mechanisms?

814
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:22,780
That if we just really
believe in it, than

815
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,810
those can take over.

816
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:24,945
And could we harness that?

817
00:33:24,945 --> 00:33:27,330
Could we harness these
naturally occurring

818
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:30,110
self-healing capacities in
people's minds and brains to

819
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,960
make themselves better?

820
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,000
So this is a kind of typical
average results.

821
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,440
Drug, psychotherapy,
about the same.

822
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,160
Placebo, pretty close.

823
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,650
And here's the no
treatment group.

824
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:43,950
But even this, kind
of the picture has

825
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,120
been challenged recently.

826
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,420
And let me tell you what the
challenges have been and then

827
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,730
let me tell you what I take
as the takeaway message.

828
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:53,540
But it's not scientifically
certain.

829
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:56,300
So one person did a
meta-analysis and

830
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,940
he's totally arguing--

831
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,700
and let me tell you, the
argument's pretty clever.

832
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,150
There's no effect of
a drug at all.

833
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:05,010
That typically, you get
about 75% of a drug

834
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,020
effect from the placebo.

835
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:06,620
That's huge.

836
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:10,250
75% from an inert substance,
sugar or something like that.

837
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,060
OK.

838
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:14,610
75% in treating a severe
psychiatric disorder.

839
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,820
And he says that that small
difference, that

840
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,300
25% is due to this.

841
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,760
And who even thinks of this
until you read this, if you

842
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,889
haven't been involved in a
drug study, that apparent

843
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:24,820
differences are due to patients
realizing they have

844
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,449
the active drug from
the side effects.

845
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:27,670
OK.

846
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:30,020
So most studies give
you the drug.

847
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:35,380
Most drugs that treat things
have unpleasant side effects.

848
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,100
Because they're potent
things, OK, that

849
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,650
are perfectly targeted.

850
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:40,340
So they're saying oh,
it's double blind.

851
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,900
You tell this patient,
here's your pills.

852
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,630
You don't know if they're
placebo or drug.

853
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,310
And here's your pills.

854
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,929
You don't know if they're
placebo or drugs.

855
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:47,440
But patient's are reasonably
smart.

856
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,400
Many have been through
treatment before.

857
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,590
And they know if they're feeling
nauseous, and yucky,

858
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,570
and all kinds of other stuff,
they got the drug.

859
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:57,210
And if they take it and they
don't feel anything funny,

860
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:58,950
they got the sugar placebo.

861
00:34:58,950 --> 00:34:59,760
Does that make sense?

862
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,520
Because they figure out--

863
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,250
and 80% of the time they're
accurate, whether they got the

864
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,420
inert placebo or the drug.

865
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:10,050
Because this side effects tell
them that, not the drug effect

866
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:12,250
on the mind.

867
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,670
And that in the few studies
where they give you up a

868
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:17,110
placebo that has peripheral
effects, that make you

869
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:20,020
nauseous like the drug, then
in those couple of studies,

870
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,130
there's just been a couple,
there's no difference between

871
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:23,370
placebo and drug.

872
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:28,110
So here's a position that the
entire thing is placebo.

873
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:30,660
And an argument from this guy
that we should tell patients,

874
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,100
it's all placebo.

875
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,470
Now why do you think that it's
not necessarily a good idea to

876
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,900
tell patients even if it were
scientifically true?

877
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,370
Yeah?

878
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:39,568
AUDIENCE: Because if you
tell them it's a

879
00:35:39,568 --> 00:35:40,196
placebo it could ruin--

880
00:35:40,196 --> 00:35:41,140
PROFESSOR JOHN GABRIELI: Yeah.

881
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,680
There's a pretty good chance
you've ruined it.

882
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:46,350
If you hand them the pills and
you go, look, who know.

883
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,100
It's all sugar.

884
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,880
But you know give it
a go for a person

885
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,810
who's in misery, right.

886
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:52,380
So they have to kind
of believe.

887
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,560
And it's kind of interesting.

888
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,210
What is the biology
of that belief?

889
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:55,810
Right.

890
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:58,070
So that's one side
of the story.

891
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:01,050
Another slightly less drastic
interpretation, but also

892
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:05,106
pretty strong, is that in recent
meta-analysis is that

893
00:36:05,106 --> 00:36:08,930
the drug effect of a placebo
only occurs for the most

894
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:11,760
severe depressions, the most
severe depressions.

895
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,870
And the Depression Center even
considered severe or moderate,

896
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,780
where you do want to help
people, there's no difference

897
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:19,670
between the placebo
and the drugs.

898
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:23,150
So my only fear in telling you
this is the last thing you

899
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:25,320
want to do if in your life, or
somebody you care about,

900
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,830
there's depression or anything
like that, get them help.

901
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:28,700
Because there are helped.

902
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,840
And if it's placebo,
that's OK too.

903
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,320
And if it's some unreputable
person without a degree but

904
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,350
they're really good at talking
to people, that's good too.

905
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:37,090
OK.

906
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,230
The evidence is overwhelming.

907
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:41,130
That getting help helps
many people.

908
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:42,640
And not getting help
out people at

909
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,690
greater and greater risks.

910
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:44,490
It's overwhelming.

911
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:46,800
Getting help is a really
good thing.

912
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,460
It's just that we don't
understand how the help works.

913
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:52,300
And we know it doesn't help
nearly powerfully enough on a

914
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,650
consistent basis.

915
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:58,860
So now we're going to switch
from depression to ADHD, a

916
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,280
disease of childhood.

917
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,980
These are children who have
inattention, hyperactive in

918
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:07,000
80% of cases, impulsive, moving
around, and jumpy.

919
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,500
The diagnosis, like everything,
is by exclusion.

920
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,430
They make sure that there's not
some other problem in the

921
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,320
child's life that's making
them inattentive or

922
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:13,930
impossible.

923
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,370
For example, like
abuse at home.

924
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:19,570
Its prevalence is 2
million or more.

925
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,700
It's tripled since 1981,
increased 2.5 times since '90.

926
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,010
So sort of like the discussions
you hear now about

927
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:29,660
autism, there was fantastic
debates about ADHD.

928
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,300
Does it exist at all?

929
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,750
Are people just medicating kids
to keep them lined up in

930
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:37,890
classrooms, quietly listening
to lectures like me?

931
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,730
Is there a real problem?

932
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:41,420
And there's incredibly
polarized

933
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:44,170
debates about these things.

934
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:46,530
So how does the clinician
make the diagnosis?

935
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,140
They look at the child.

936
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,340
They talk to parents,
teachers.

937
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,580
And they sort of fill out

938
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,300
questionnaires and have a list.

939
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,820
And I'll show you the kind of
a list the clinician has to

940
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:58,570
work against.

941
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,520
Depending on studies, and this
is kind of an interesting

942
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:05,620
number, ranges from about
2% to about 15%.

943
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,560
And you can say, well how could
it possibly do that?

944
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,330
Why can't researchers
get it right?

945
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,000
OK.

946
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,180
You could take a 1/2 a percent
off, or two or whatever it is.

947
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,670
And again, it depends
so much of your

948
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:19,130
criteria for the diagnosis.

949
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,220
Part of it too is over time
these things change as you

950
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,480
have different versions
of DSM.

951
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,410
And I mentioned also countries,
professions,

952
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:30,820
overnight in the same German
population doubled as DSM book

953
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,400
got revised and changed
its criteria.

954
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,592
OK.

955
00:38:33,592 --> 00:38:35,160
Is this the correct criteria?

956
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,780
Are these the correct
criteria?

957
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,660
And how would you know if you
had the correct criteria?

958
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,440
How would you know if
you've got it right?

959
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,490
People just have to
have consensus as

960
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:43,550
best they can guess.

961
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:46,050
Because there's no objective
evidence beyond reasonable

962
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,310
interpretation.

963
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:50,300
So about 3-5% of school
age children.

964
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,360
And the reason that people take
it seriously beyond these

965
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:56,640
conceptual debates is that
children with ADHD that is not

966
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,970
treated struggle a lot.

967
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:04,580
To a huge variation of course,
but it predicts anti-social

968
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:07,390
behavior, substance abuse,
adverse occupational social

969
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:07,780
adjustments.

970
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:10,340
There are people with ADHD who
are phenomenally successful.

971
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,550
There's probably several of you
in the class who have been

972
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:15,020
diagnosed with that in
any group like this.

973
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:18,170
So it's not the certain thing,
but on average if you don't

974
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:21,330
have other talents, and
situations, and support, it's

975
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:24,460
a big risk factor for doing
badly in life by the ways that

976
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,390
most people want to do well.

977
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:29,200
The most common, but not the
only treatment, is a Ritalin

978
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,140
or methylphenidate.

979
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,160
The Ritalin is the commercial
name, methylphedidate the

980
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,510
generic name.

981
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,080
We know there's a genetic
piece about this.

982
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,640
You've heard it so many times.

983
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,340
7 times higher rate within
families, about a 0.76

984
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:43,100
heritability in twin studies.

985
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,790
Some candidate genes have been
identified and involved in the

986
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:47,430
dopaminergic systems
of the brain.

987
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:49,890
But like with all
neuropsychiatric diseases, in

988
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:51,320
kind of a weak way.

989
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,120
It's not like there's a
gene, if you have it,

990
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,000
you have the disorder.

991
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,990
Is just a little higher on
average in populations.

992
00:39:58,990 --> 00:39:59,310
OK.

993
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:01,620
So here's the question,
a kid comes in to you.

994
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,520
You're the doctor.

995
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,650
And it's quite interesting to
talk to doctors about this.

996
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,810
Because in many medical settings
with the current

997
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:10,550
economic environment, doctors
are incredibly encouraged, and

998
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:13,220
by for example, their salaries,
to see patients

999
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,800
really fast.

1000
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,110
The faster they see them, the
more the health systems says,

1001
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,360
yeah, we're productive.

1002
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,280

1003
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,160
So here's what they have
to decide, do you had

1004
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:24,820
inattention?

1005
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,810
Because inattention was one
of the big criteria.

1006
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:28,790
You have to have at least six
for at least six months to

1007
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:32,200
agree that it's maladaptive
and age inappropriate.

1008
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,350
Careless mistakes in school or
productivity, I'm sure none of

1009
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,840
us ever make careless
mistakes, right.

1010
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,060
Difficulty sustaining attention
in tasks or play,

1011
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,240
does not seem to listen when
spoken to directly, not follow

1012
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:44,180
instructions to finish tasks,
difficult organizing tasks and

1013
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:44,550
activities.

1014
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:47,310
Avoids, listen to this one,
avoids tasks engaging

1015
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:50,090
sustained mental effort, OK.

1016
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:52,290
Loses things, easily distracted
by extraneous

1017
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:54,080
stimuli, forgetful in
daily activities.

1018
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,710
What five-year-old is
not describable

1019
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:57,870
in these ways, right?

1020
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,410
So you see how challenging
it is?

1021
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:01,070
And it's not to take
it lightly.

1022
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:03,380
Because the kids who really
meet this, really

1023
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,210
struggle over time.

1024
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:06,320
There's been many longitudinal
studies.

1025
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,530
That on average, children who
meet these criteria will

1026
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:12,310
struggle in many ways.

1027
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:13,260
But look at all of these.

1028
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,810
There's nothing here like
hearing a voice, right?

1029
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:17,520
It's just like a kid.

1030
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,970
But a little more of
it for your age.

1031
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:24,610
Hyperactivity, you fidget
or squirm in your seat.

1032
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,050
You leave your seat
in the classroom.

1033
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,290
You run about or climb
excessively.

1034
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:30,210
You have difficulty
playing quietly.

1035
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:31,370
You talk excessively.

1036
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:33,350
Blurts out answers before
questions are completed.

1037
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:35,220
So these are kids who are
tough on teachers in

1038
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,470
classrooms.

1039
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:38,600

1040
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,020
The symptoms have to be present
before the age of

1041
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:44,650
seven, persistent in two or
more settings, at home and

1042
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:46,650
school for example, typically.

1043
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:49,630
And then not because you don't
hear well, or because you have

1044
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:52,290
allergies, or you have other
psychiatric disorders.

1045
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:54,540
And sometimes people talk about
both, inattention and

1046
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,730
hyperactivity, or the
combined type.

1047
00:41:56,730 --> 00:42:00,510
There is a thought that the more
frequent finding in boys

1048
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:03,000
is because boys are more
frequently hyperactive.

1049
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,410
So they're trouble making
in a classroom.

1050
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:05,290
They're jumping up and down.

1051
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:06,610
They're not listening
to the teacher.

1052
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:10,400
And the girls might be more on
average inattentive, quiet and

1053
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,860
dreamy, not taking stuff in.

1054
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,900
That's not a problem for
classroom management.

1055
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,540
So there's a thought the girls
might be under diagnosed

1056
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:21,120
because of the way it's
expressed in boys and girls.

1057
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,690
But there's a huge source
of evidence that if left

1058
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:26,720
completely untreated, rates of
depression, anxiety, substance

1059
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,820
abuse, academic failure, work
problems, family problems,

1060
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:31,265
emotional distress are much
higher in children where

1061
00:42:31,265 --> 00:42:34,560
there's no attempt to treat
or manage ADHD.

1062
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,430
There's a huge amount of
evidence for this.

1063
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:40,790
So one of the sort of most
famous studies in

1064
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:46,000
developmental psychiatry of
directly comparing individuals

1065
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,570
on behavioral and
drug treatments.

1066
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:50,790
It was a study called
the MTA study.

1067
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:53,590
It was done in many different
sites all put together with a

1068
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:57,150
huge number of children, 14
months, they got medication

1069
00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:01,370
management alone, behavioral
treatment alone, a combination

1070
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,950
of both, or routine
community care.

1071
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:04,800
So they said, what happens
when we give you better

1072
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,360
behavioral treatment, or more
careful medical management on

1073
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:11,010
the drugs, or you go back to
your standard community care?

1074
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:13,610
And what people found was
this, that medication

1075
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:16,536
management alone--

1076
00:43:16,536 --> 00:43:18,380
Here's what they did in
those conditions.

1077
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,890
They saw a doctor monthly
for 30 minutes.

1078
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:23,400
They would move the drugged
amount up or down.

1079
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,090
They would titrate it if it
seemed to be sedating the

1080
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:27,460
child too much, they'd
make it less.

1081
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,570
If it was not working enough,
make it more.

1082
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:31,390
And they will talk a lot with
a child and the parent.

1083
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:32,630
So that was the medication
management.

1084
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:34,820
More active than you typically
get people get at medical

1085
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,950
interactions.

1086
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:39,110
Behavioral treatments involved
an 8-week summer camp, or you

1087
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:40,560
got the two of them together.

1088
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,610
Or you were sent back to your
community and got the regular

1089
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:47,010
care from a regular doctor that
people typically get.

1090
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:50,450
So and the big outcomes were
that the best thing was to

1091
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:52,350
have the medical management
alone, or a

1092
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:55,050
combination of the two.

1093
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:57,850
And in some cases, you would get
lower doses of medications

1094
00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:00,280
if you got the behavioral
treatment.

1095
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:03,160
So you could say, and for many
years I heard lecturers who

1096
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,530
were expert in this field
saying, the definitive thing

1097
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:08,410
is the medication pretty
much does it all.

1098
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:11,120
Maybe the behavioral treatment
had something, the behavioral

1099
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,790
treatment by itself
didn't add much.

1100
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:14,750
This was what everybody
was taught.

1101
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:18,080
But they kept following
these people and

1102
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:18,760
here's what they found.

1103
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,180
Eight years later after the
study was over, no difference

1104
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:23,020
in which group you were in.

1105
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:27,380
About 60% of kids stopped taking
medication, the family

1106
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:29,640
decided to stop, or the doctor
decided to stop.

1107
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,890
And there's no difference
between those who did or did

1108
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:36,240
not stop taking medication, in
terms of difficulties in life.

1109
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,320
So now this is very
complicated.

1110
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,450
Because people always say like,
what is the long-term

1111
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:42,020
effects of taking Ritalin
in children?

1112
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:43,790
What is the long-term effects?

1113
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:47,750
And you go well, you
could say the first

1114
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:48,760
interpretation is this.

1115
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,740
Well, since it didn't make any
difference, the drug has no

1116
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,420
effect at all, right.

1117
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:54,890
You take the drug, you don't
take the drug, you have the

1118
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:56,280
same outcome.

1119
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,660
14-months was something.

1120
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,780
But eight years, it
doesn't matter.

1121
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,480
But of course, who's more likely
to stop taking the

1122
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,000
medication?

1123
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,100
Kids who are doing better or
kids who are doing worse?

1124
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:09,030
Who's more likely to
stop probably?

1125
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:10,880
On average, kids who are
doing better, right.

1126
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,590
So maybe what you're really--
maybe no difference is some

1127
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:14,960
kids were improving
for other reasons.

1128
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,370
And so really, the kids who got
the medications caught up

1129
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:19,690
with them because of
the medications.

1130
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:21,080
And you can't tell those
two things apart.

1131
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:24,030
So it's just incredibly hard
to know with certainty what

1132
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:26,690
the right thing to do is
in any long-term view.

1133
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:29,300
Because you can control for
14-months what people do, if

1134
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,810
they're willing to
let you do that.

1135
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:32,090
But you can't control
it over years.

1136
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:34,260
They go back to their own
complicated lives.

1137
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,430
And sorting out what the
treatment did, versus the rest

1138
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:37,990
of their life is really hard.

1139
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:40,060
So Charlie, if we could
do the VCR movie.

1140
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:44,110
Here's a example of a kid
with ADHD and some

1141
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:45,360
discussion about that.

1142
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:48,082

1143
00:45:48,082 --> 00:45:50,300
You know, amazingly I can tell
you that even though they're

1144
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:54,190
as good as it can do, there is
no behavioral test you can

1145
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:57,830
give like this that's better
than 50/50 at separating an

1146
00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:00,310
ADHD child from other
children.

1147
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:02,390
So you could be part
of the story.

1148
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:04,960
But many, many, many children
will not be identified this

1149
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,540
way even though they're having
real problems at

1150
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:07,400
school and at home.

1151
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,020
I want to say two things
about the video game.

1152
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:11,880
People, as they noted
here, sometimes ADHD

1153
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,180
diagnoses are tough.

1154
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:16,570
Because when kids come into a
new situation, a doctor's

1155
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:18,490
office, a new doctor,
an evaluation,

1156
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:19,690
it gets their attention.

1157
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:23,090
And they look more
focused, OK.

1158
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:25,430
And people have noticed that
kids with ADHD seem to do

1159
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:28,750
quite well when they have an
entertaining video game, which

1160
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:31,400
is easier to enjoy, right,
than most things.

1161
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,540
So they actually did the study
to ask how long does an ADHD

1162
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:37,400
kid play a video game versus
a kid without ADHD.

1163
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:40,420
And when they're both playing
video games, still the ADHD

1164
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:42,740
kid plays for less long.

1165
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:44,330
So it's not that it
takes it away.

1166
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:46,545
But it in many ways, obfuscates
the difference.

1167
00:46:46,545 --> 00:46:50,750

1168
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:55,670
So one interesting question
is what is the right dose?

1169
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:58,580
Because we said the treatments
where they titrated the dose,

1170
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:00,980
where you went to a doctor
frequently and they said let's

1171
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:03,220
push it up, let's push it
down, let's get the dose

1172
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,700
that's right for the child.

1173
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,010
What is that number?

1174
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:09,660
So here's a paper all the
way back from 1977.

1175
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:13,030
Here's placebo, here's a small
dose, here's a large dose.

1176
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:14,690
And they measured three
different things.

1177
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:17,670
They measured how well
you did in terms

1178
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:19,330
of the teacher ratings.

1179
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:21,130
So a teacher say, how's
the kid doing?

1180
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:23,160
That's the open bars, OK.

1181
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,320
So the teacher said, here's
how the kid's doing.

1182
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,690
They go, well, this
is even better.

1183
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:29,880
And they go this is
even the best, OK.

1184
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,280
So the teachers are saying,
the more drug the better.

1185
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:35,460
Here's an objective measure of
learning performance by those

1186
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,130
children, the same children.

1187
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:39,320
Better, worse.

1188
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,820
So you see, we go back to the
ideas that came out of the

1189
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:46,160
prefrontal lobotomies,
completely different topic.

1190
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,550
Everybody pretty much in the
field agrees that these drugs

1191
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:50,550
help these kids on
average, OK.

1192
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:52,980
But think about the
complications of what the

1193
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,290
right dose is.

1194
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:56,890
For the teacher, the biggest
dose is best.

1195
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:59,090
And why do you think that's
likely to be?

1196
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:00,640
For the teacher doing classroom

1197
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,610
management with the 30 kids?

1198
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:04,275
Why does a big dose seem best?

1199
00:48:04,275 --> 00:48:07,070

1200
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:07,370
Yeah?

1201
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:09,438
AUDIENCE: Because they want
the kids to be really

1202
00:48:09,438 --> 00:48:09,880
manageable.

1203
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:10,840
PROFESSOR JOHN GABRIELI:
Yes Yeah, yeah.

1204
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,810
You were going to say
the same thing.

1205
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:12,070
Yeah.

1206
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:14,600
For them it's the kid is not
fidgeting, not jumping around,

1207
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,250
distracting the other kids.

1208
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:19,690
So a slightly over-sedated
kid seems like a triumph.

1209
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:23,530
And it can be to a parent also,
like listening to me.

1210
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:26,060
But objective learning measures,
this is optimal.

1211
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:28,310
And this is overdosing.

1212
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:29,580
So I think we'd all agree.

1213
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:31,220
This is the one that matters
most of all.

1214
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:34,830
But you can see, you don't
often have this kind of

1215
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:35,220
measurement.

1216
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:37,470
Often the doctor says, what
does a teacher think?

1217
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:38,580
What does the parent think?

1218
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:41,160
And the kid will end up over
here because that's what seems

1219
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:45,690
most correct to the eyes of the
teacher or the parent, the

1220
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:48,170
biggest change in the
child's behavior.

1221
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:49,360
So for the last couple of
minutes I want to talk about

1222
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,470
brain imaging in regards
to ADHD.

1223
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,150
So we talked about the idea that
the cerebral cortex, you

1224
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:57,330
have too much of it, too many
neurons and over connected.

1225
00:48:57,330 --> 00:49:00,500
And that what it is to grow the
adult brain you have is to

1226
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:03,340
eliminate neurons and synapses
that are not

1227
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:04,670
functionally valuable.

1228
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:06,290
You're picking out
the most valuable

1229
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:09,040
players of your neurons.

1230
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,750
And so you can say there's a
peak age at which you go up

1231
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:12,420
and then you go down.

1232
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,640
And you consider that peak to
be a sort of milestone of

1233
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,840
development.

1234
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,383
And you can see here in the
dorsal lateral prefrontal of

1235
00:49:18,383 --> 00:49:20,410
the cortex, here's the
front of the brain.

1236
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:23,170
Here's the delay in
ADH children.

1237
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:28,120
They take an average two years
longer to reach that peak than

1238
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,290
do typically developing kids.

1239
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:33,120
But there's no difference
at all in primary

1240
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,890
somatosensory cortex.

1241
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:39,530
So you might imagine it on
systems that are the inputs of

1242
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:41,320
sensory stimulation
from the world, an

1243
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,580
ADHD child is typical.

1244
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:46,500
For parts of the brain that
regulate, like I'm not going

1245
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,870
to pay attention to that or I'm
going to focus on this.

1246
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:50,430
That's slower developing.

1247
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:53,060
And you could see how that might
lead to inattention or

1248
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:54,790
easy distractability.

1249
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:58,790
So a two-year delay in the
development on average of

1250
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:03,290
prefrontal cortex structure.

1251
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:04,600
I talked with you before,
and I'm just going to

1252
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,290
remind you of this.

1253
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:09,390
That if we look at reward
systems, anticipation of a

1254
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:12,580
reward coming up in a few
moments activates the nucleus

1255
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:14,170
accumbens in animals
and humans.

1256
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:16,880
This is in humans, anticipation
of a reward.

1257
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,490

1258
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:22,830
And the same system that's
measured here goes on to the

1259
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:25,220
medial prefrontal cortex.

1260
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:28,590
And that system turns on when
you get the reward.

1261
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:30,000
So one thing anticipates.

1262
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,740
And one thing responds when
you get the reward.

1263
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:35,120
And there's been some slightly
divergent studies in ADHD.

1264
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,570
But one suggestion
one is this.

1265
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:40,920
So here's the control subjects
anticipating the reward.

1266
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,800
Here's the ADHD individuals also
anticipating the reward

1267
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,390
but not showing any
activation.

1268
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:50,900
It's as if, now remember the
reward is this, you get a

1269
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:53,520
signal that tells you in a few
moments if you push a button,

1270
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,940
you're going to get $1.

1271
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:58,460
This is not like study now, and
if you complete college,

1272
00:50:58,460 --> 00:50:59,650
you get to go to
medical school.

1273
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:01,280
It's not delayed
gratification.

1274
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,776
It's anticipating reward coming
up in about 10 seconds.

1275
00:51:05,776 --> 00:51:07,860
And at least in these
patients, it

1276
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:09,290
doesn't drive the system.

1277
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:13,800
It's as if delayed gratification
were not having

1278
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,760
any attraction with
these brains.

1279
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:19,570
On the other hand, then you find
out if you got it or not,

1280
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:22,650
because sometimes they trick
you don't get it, orbital

1281
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:24,630
frontal response and
controls, and much

1282
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:25,890
more in ADHD patients.

1283
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:29,320
If this picture is true, or at
least true for some patients,

1284
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:34,840
imagine the consequences of
anticipating reward, but being

1285
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,800
overly responsive to whether
you got it or not.

1286
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,650
You'd be stimulus
bound, right.

1287
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:40,620
You couldn't hold
yourself back.

1288
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:44,640
It's not helping you develop
delayed gratification.

1289
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,600
And here's one more thing
that people ask,

1290
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,970
which is if you have--

1291
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:50,660
because now there's some
evidence about this-- if you

1292
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:54,730
give Ritalin for a while, does
it's slow the development of

1293
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:55,750
the cerebral cortex?

1294
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:57,180
And I won't go into
the details here.

1295
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,100
But he answers is it does not.

1296
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:01,700
So people are worried, like if
we keep giving Ritalin for

1297
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:04,130
some more years are we affecting
brain structure?

1298
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:05,560
And the evidence is clear.

1299
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,810
Objectives of it is
that it is not.

1300
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:10,220
So I think a lot of people feel
like if the medication's

1301
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:12,470
helpful, there's very little
evidence there's

1302
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:14,070
harmful side effects.

1303
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:15,680
Weirdly enough, Ritalin--

1304
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,220
and we'll come back to
this just in a --

1305
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:19,890
is one of the least problematic
medications in

1306
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:24,300
psychiatry, and frequently
helpful.

1307
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:28,520
So the last FMRI study I want
to show you is this.

1308
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,285
Let's say you gave Ritalin not
only to children with ADHD who

1309
00:52:31,285 --> 00:52:32,170
are taking it.

1310
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:35,410
But also typically developing
children who've never taken

1311
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:38,790
Ritalin because they're
typically developing.

1312
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:41,260
And how do their brains
respond to that?

1313
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:45,480
So here's some ADHD children,
and children without ADHD.

1314
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,750
And here's the tasks
they perform.

1315
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:51,680
Sometimes they push a button
every time a letter appears--

1316
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,670
they're having a whole bunch of
letters here, push, push,

1317
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:55,980
push, push.

1318
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:59,520
But they're told when an
X appears, don't push.

1319
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,880
So you're tricking
the subjects.

1320
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,860
Because you're getting
a habit going.

1321
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:03,910
What people call . prepotent
response.

1322
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:05,730
So it's push, push,
push, push.

1323
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:08,840
Oops, hold yourself back, OK.

1324
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,410
What people call no
go, don't go.

1325
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:13,170
And that's hard to
do for a kid.

1326
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:15,770
It's harder to do for somebody
to do with ADHD, to control

1327
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:18,740
the impulse to push.

1328
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:20,110
And so you measure brain.

1329
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:21,540
And here's the behavior.

1330
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:22,860
And then let me tell
you the issue.

1331
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:25,240
So here's the percent
of false alarms.

1332
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,640
This is when you pushed for the
X, you should have held

1333
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,230
yourself back.

1334
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:32,840
Here's the control, here's the
ADHD children, making more

1335
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,400
impulsive errors overall, harder
to control themselves

1336
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,590
and stop themselves from pushing
for that X. When

1337
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:42,480
they're off Ritalin they make
more mistakes when they're on.

1338
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:47,090
But look at these kids who have
no ADHD and never took it

1339
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:49,300
because they have no
reason to take it.

1340
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:50,060
They perform better.

1341
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,090
But look at the drug effect.

1342
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:54,090
Just the same size.

1343
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:56,600
And this is not the only study
that has found that giving

1344
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:00,400
typical children Ritalin, will
make them perform better on

1345
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,590
cognitively demanding tasks.

1346
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:06,160
They are typically not done so
well by children as by adults.

1347
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,910
So the psychiatrist we worked
with on the study said, wow,

1348
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:12,110
we used to think that if we gave
somebody Ritalin and they

1349
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:15,080
behaved better, we knew we
gave the right treatment.

1350
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,390
But it's not clear that these
kids aren't behaving better.

1351
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:18,540
OK.

1352
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:19,470
They have no problem.

1353
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:23,150
And there's no reason to give
them the medication.

1354
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:25,700
And let me step through this.

1355
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:28,230
If you look in the brains at
where the Ritalin's affecting

1356
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:31,490
things, and lots of the brain,
the control subjects, and ADHD

1357
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:33,240
children look alike.

1358
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,260
The only part of their brain
that looks really different is

1359
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:37,240
in the basal ganglia, part of
their brain that's involving

1360
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:40,320
in habits and impulse
controls.

1361
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:44,640
Also implicated in OCD that
we talked about before.

1362
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,280
It's an area that's full of
dopaminergic systems.

1363
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,090
It's an area that Ritalin
binds to.

1364
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:53,220
When you look inside the brain
in animals, and here what was

1365
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:53,860
found was this.

1366
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:56,010
So this is a behavioral
difference you saw before.

1367
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:58,690
So if you look in the basal
ganglia, here's the controlled

1368
00:54:58,690 --> 00:55:02,930
children off the medication,
and then on the medication.

1369
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:05,470
Here's the ADHD showing this
opposite response.

1370
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:08,360
So here's the only place where
the responses are different

1371
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:09,560
between the controlled children

1372
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,050
and the ADHD children.

1373
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:13,470
And you can see in a way the
medication is so-called

1374
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:14,680
normalizing the activation.

1375
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:19,540
So here's typical kids just
being themselves, no Ritalin.

1376
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:22,270
Here's children with
ADHD not treated.

1377
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:23,000
And now you can see.

1378
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,350
Now look how similar they
get with the treatment.

1379
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:26,010
OK.

1380
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:28,730
So in this part of the brain,
and its opposite effect when

1381
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:31,420
the typical children get the
drug, the activation go down,

1382
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:32,550
the ADHD children, it goes up.

1383
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:34,820
So this part of the brain seems
like it's an important

1384
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:35,850
part of the story.

1385
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:38,600
And also of how the medication
influences somebody.

1386
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,280
So last thing I want to talk
about for two minutes

1387
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:46,050
including the chapter in this,
or three minutes is the

1388
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:49,040
struggle that people have of,
what's the boundary between

1389
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,220
treating an outright
disease and

1390
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:53,810
manipulating normal variation?

1391
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:57,310
So for example, here's the
average height in the US of

1392
00:55:57,310 --> 00:55:58,850
men and women.

1393
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:03,560
Huge debate about whether people
who are on a very sort

1394
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,910
of, are projected to have
a very short stature in

1395
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:10,380
adulthood, should they get
growth hormone or not?

1396
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:12,330
One argument is no, why
even think about it?

1397
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:15,280
Some parents will feel like,
my kid might struggle.

1398
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,460
Give the kid a break.

1399
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:17,570
You can do something about it.

1400
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:20,680
You don't have to do that.

1401
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,130
How about sadness
and depression?

1402
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:25,965
If you're somewhat sad,
should they get CBT?

1403
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:28,270
Or do they have to be
and dark depression?

1404
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:31,530
Where's the boundary between
shyness and social anxiety?

1405
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:34,110
Or a kid doesn't follow
directions, when do you say

1406
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:37,060
that's a kid not paying
attention to ADHD?

1407
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:41,300
So one of the big surprises
has been that when people

1408
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,710
have--and you guys can
tell me in a moment.

1409
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:45,260
When people pole things,
you never know how

1410
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:47,070
accurate these are.

1411
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:50,460
In some polls 7% of university
students without ADHD say they

1412
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:52,890
take methylphenidate to help
them focus and concentrate on

1413
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:54,020
their studies.

1414
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:57,360
And even more disturbing to
scientists, in one study in

1415
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:01,340
nature, 20% percent of
scientists said they do it.

1416
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:05,140
So I'm not asking you
to turn yourself in.

1417
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:07,690
But this is my little poll of
undergraduates in the world

1418
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:10,460
out there, because that's what
I read in the magazines.

1419
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:15,260
So is there moderately
widespread use of it by people

1420
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:19,445
who are not prescribed
directly themselves?

1421
00:57:19,445 --> 00:57:20,695
Or is it pretty rare?

1422
00:57:20,695 --> 00:57:28,480

1423
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,870
Rare?

1424
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:33,660
It could be rare, you know.

1425
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:34,910
OK.

1426
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:36,550

1427
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:37,680
And then what is the
right thing?

1428
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:41,440
Where in all this will people
debate about this?

1429
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,180
I think there's no debate that
for people who are really

1430
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:44,670
suffering, you want
to help them.

1431
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:47,790
But where should the line be
drawn between you know,

1432
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:52,250
helping those in despair and
boosting those in the middle.

1433
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:54,230
So last example I want to give
you just for a minute is this

1434
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:58,960
chapter from a man who mistook
his wife for a hat.

1435
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,630
Because of this question about
boosting experience.

1436
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:04,150
So this is a woman of
90, Natasha Kay.

1437
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:05,180
She comes to the clinic.

1438
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:08,220
And after her 88th birthday
she began to change.

1439
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:09,045
She felt thrilled.

1440
00:58:09,045 --> 00:58:11,110
She was extremely well.

1441
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:14,030
People said see had changed from
being shy to flirtatious,

1442
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:16,720
giggling, telling
jokes at age 88.

1443
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,730
She had this huge
transformation.

1444
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:21,240
It turns out she has
syphilis, what she

1445
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,340
calls cupid's disease.

1446
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:26,160
But she's quite enjoying the
change in personality.

1447
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,760
She's disinhibited and having
a good time, OK.

1448
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:32,410
It's like the small bit of
alcohol that loosens you up

1449
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:35,340
but all the time without any
of the downside, right.

1450
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:36,820
And then they said well,
should we treat it?

1451
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:39,750
Because she got the disease at
an age when penicillin was not

1452
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:40,870
widely given.

1453
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:44,100
And they discover happily that
if they treat the penicillin

1454
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:45,610
it protects her medically.

1455
00:58:45,610 --> 00:58:48,250
But because the brain changed
from the neurosyphilis has

1456
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:52,080
occurred, she remains very
happy all the time.

1457
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:55,790
So you know, if somebody could
give you a drug that could

1458
00:58:55,790 --> 00:59:01,760
make you very happy all the
time, bad idea, good idea?

1459
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,030
Anyway, so you could
think about it.

1460
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:04,280
Thanks very much.

1461
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:46,793
