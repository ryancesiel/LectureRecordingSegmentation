00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:31,970

10
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,532
PROFESSOR: OK, good afternoon.

11
00:00:33,532 --> 00:00:36,970

12
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,540
So today we're going to
talk about learning.

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:50,590
So what can you do now that you
couldn't do as an infant,

14
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,490
very simply?

15
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,300
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

16
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,530
PROFESSOR: Talk, that's
a good one.

17
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,860
Language, that's pretty
good, right?

18
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,050
Anything else that you
couldn't do, yeah?

19
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,070
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

20
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,700
PROFESSOR: Yeah, we don't
actually know what the

21
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,330
internal mental life of
an infant's like.

22
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,830
But it doesn't seem like they
remember many very specific

23
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:07,990
things about their lives.

24
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,450
You do.

25
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,160
But you know it's a lot more
than, you know a ton of stuff,

26
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,860
a lot of facts, right, things
about the world, the values

27
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,820
you hold, about your family,
your culture, the country or

28
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,650
countries you've grown up in.

29
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:24,650
You just know a ton compared
to an infant.

30
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,010
And there's only two ways
that you know this.

31
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:30,470
It's either in your genes when
you're born or you learned it

32
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:30,960
through life.

33
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,420
And so we're going to talk today
about how scientific

34
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,720
psychology tries to
approach learning.

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,820
And in a remarkable thing about
learning is we often

36
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,980
think, well, we're learning
lessons or whatever.

37
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,150
We're learning material.

38
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,790
But the important part of
learning the way we think

39
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,350
about it is that it allows us
to predict the future on the

40
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,700
basis of the past, right?

41
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,750
We want to learn lessons in life
to know what's desirable,

42
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,790
what's dangerous, what's a
smart way to do things so

43
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,880
we're more effective.

44
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,080
We choose what we want to do
better in the future to learn

45
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,390
from the past and predict
the future.

46
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,630
It imbues our word
with meaning.

47
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,830
For an infant, not much
means much, right?

48
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,930
They just look around.

49
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,160
Who knows what anything means.

50
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,700
Words, gestures, facial
expressions, there's not much

51
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,720
meaning of the world
out there.

52
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,860
For you, the world is full of
meaning, history, social

53
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,610
interactions, everything that
you're thinking about.

54
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,950
So how do we acquire the
meanings of things in the

55
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,590
world that matter to us?

56
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,930
And it's also had an interesting
kind of a give and

57
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,790
take with how we learn about
learning in scientific

58
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:29,930
psychology and sort
of historically.

59
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,290
I'll just touch a tiny
bit on that.

60
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,200
And we'll talk about three
aspects of learning today:

61
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,150
classical conditioning, operant
conditioning, and then

62
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,000
various ways in which there are
limits to conditioning.

63
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,420
Thank you, Todd.

64
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,800
So let's start with sort of one
of the most famous figures

65
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,780
in all of conditioning or
learning, Ivan Pavlov, who

66
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,160
actually won a Nobel Prize,
not for his studies of

67
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,470
learning, but for his sort of
groundbreaking studies for the

68
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,000
reflexes of digestion.

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,260
He worked out a lot of the
fundamentals of how, in

70
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:04,000
mammals, your stomach breaks
down food and that how food in

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,500
the mouth provokes specific
salivation that begins the

72
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,640
process by which food is
decomposed and then digested

73
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,870
in your stomach, the
fundamentals of really how we

74
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,310
live, right, eat to live.

75
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,985
And he was very interested in
salivation reflexes, what is

76
00:03:17,985 --> 00:03:21,090
it that drives that first bit of
breaking down food in your

77
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,590
mouth with saliva?

78
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:27,690
And Pavlov was a pretty intense
researcher, as you

79
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,360
might be used to at MIT.

80
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,930
There's a famous story where a
graduate student came somewhat

81
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,850
late to the lab and said,
but Professor, there's a

82
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,350
revolution going on with
shooting in the streets.

83
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,330
This is in Russia.

84
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,080
And he said, what difference
does it make when you've got

85
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,160
work to do in the laboratory?

86
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,560
Next time there's a revolution,
get up earlier; so

87
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,840
anyway, not an easygoing
supervisor.

88
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,480
He would do experiments a little
rough in dogs, like cut

89
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,790
the esophagus, the path by which
food goes from the mouth

90
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,300
to the stomach, to understand
the role of the esophagus.

91
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,570
And he found that, even in those
animals, when he placed

92
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,370
food in the dog's mouth, he
expected, as a fundamental

93
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,940
biologist studying how digestion
works, that nothing

94
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,670
would happen.

95
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,580
But he noticed not only would
the dog salivate, even though

96
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,090
the food will never make it to
the stomach, but furthermore

97
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,680
the stomach juices, the gastric
juices that break down

98
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,810
food, also were released within
the stomach even though

99
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,610
the food would never
get there.

100
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,720
And then he got interested in
how it is that these things

101
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,340
are driven if they're not driven
simply as a direct

102
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,060
response to the arrival
of the food.

103
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,890
How is it that the mere sight
of the food or the sight of

104
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,950
the person bringing the food
would drive the salivation and

105
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,060
what he called psychic
secretions?

106
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:38,900
Because he was a biologist.

107
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,560
So he expected, basically, you
put the food in the mouth.

108
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,390
There's some chemistry between
the food and salivation.

109
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,010
And here he's finding, just
seeing food, just seeing the

110
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,080
person who would bring the
food, was driving these

111
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,460
fundamental biological
functions.

112
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,300
So there's a kind of experiment
that he would set

113
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,360
up where the dog
would be there.

114
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,030
And he would be measuring the
amount of salivation in some

115
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,790
way or another.

116
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,550
And in these kinds of
experiments-- and I'll go

117
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,480
through this language
a couple times--

118
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,165
in conditioning they've come up
with a sort of vocabulary

119
00:05:07,165 --> 00:05:09,350
to describe the pieces of things
that go into this kind

120
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,210
of learning.

121
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,690
So there's an unconditioned
stimulus, which is food.

122
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:13,790
I mean you start with that.

123
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,080
You want to eat food.

124
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,820
And there's an unconditioned
response, which is you

125
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,510
salivate when you see the food
or if it's in your mouth.

126
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,330
That's the beginning.

127
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,930
Then you're going to add
what's initially

128
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,270
a meaningless stimulus.

129
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,830
In this case, it could
be anything.

130
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,100
But in this case, we'll
say it's a bell.

131
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,920
You ring a bell before
the food comes.

132
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,800
And you're going to get to
a conditioned response.

133
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,020
The animal will say, well, the
bell predicts the food.

134
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,410
And I'll salivate to
the bell itself.

135
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,460
Even though I'll never eat the
bell, I learned that it

136
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,930
predicts the food is coming.

137
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,940
And so you've created
a new association.

138
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,980
You learned something new about
the world, that a bell

139
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,120
signals something that
drives salivation.

140
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,640
So the two things are sort of
occurring next to each other

141
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,630
in time or what Aristotle talked
about as the law of

142
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,340
contiguity.

143
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:56,320
The animal learns that the bell
predicts the food coming.

144
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,860
And so here's the basic idea.

145
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,750
At first, the tone does not
drive salivation, right?

146
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,780
There's no reason to salivate
when you hear tone by itself.

147
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,660
But as the animal discovers
that the tone predicts the

148
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,630
food, the tone predicts the
food, the tone predicts the

149
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:11,290
food, then all of a sudden the
animal starts to learn that

150
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:15,020
simply the tone alone will
drive the salivation.

151
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,040
Now this stimulus
is conditioned.

152
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,160
And you have a conditioned
response that wasn't there to

153
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,060
start with.

154
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:21,870
It's very simple, right?

155
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,590
You learn the two
are associated.

156
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:27,440
And now you begin to have a
biological response to the

157
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,890
tone alone.

158
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,760
And typically what happens is
here's a learning curve.

159
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,090
Here's how often perhaps
you salivate.

160
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,810
And across trials you learn
more and more of that.

161
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:42,310
And you finally plateau at some
level of performance.

162
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,540
So a neat thing about Pavlov is,
although there weren't a

163
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,700
lot of movies at his time, there
is a little bit of film

164
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,500
of him and his actual dogs.

165
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,195
So here's Pavlov's
actual dogs.

166
00:06:52,195 --> 00:07:04,240

167
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,170
So we said conditioning is
going to do two magical

168
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:06,850
things, right?

169
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,380
It's going to let us predict
the future on the

170
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,260
basis of the past.

171
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,670
And it is a very simple
experiment.

172
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:15,910
Now the bell predicts the food
coming up and the salivation.

173
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,700
And it imbues the world
with meaning.

174
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,780
In a sense, the bell now means,
here's dinner, right?

175
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,030
The bell is not just a bell.

176
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,425
It's something with meaning
and significance.

177
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:26,856

178
00:07:26,856 --> 00:07:30,650
These are another example of
classical conditioning.

179
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,350
And it's got some sophisticated
properties.

180
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,990
You could go, well, balloons
popping water in your face,

181
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,200
food for dinner, that's
pretty basic stuff.

182
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,610
But here are some sophisticated
properties of

183
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,490
these as learning mechanisms.

184
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:46,600
So one was already talked about,
extinction, that, if

185
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,940
the bell continues to ring and
no food arrives, the learning

186
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,000
gets weakened, weakened,
and disappears.

187
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,590
So you can learn something.

188
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,380
And you can unlearn something
because it's no longer an

189
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,900
effective predictor
of the future.

190
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,990
Generalization is kind
of cued also.

191
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,680
So imagine the frequency of the
stimulus is this, just the

192
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,790
specific frequency
of the tone.

193
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:13,250
Well, if the tone is a little
bit different, you might still

194
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,810
think food is coming, right?

195
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:18,810
So it's not that you learn
the precise thing.

196
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,900
You'll still respond if it's
a pretty similar tone.

197
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,620
And as the tone gets more and
more different, the response

198
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,090
gets weaker and weaker, right?

199
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,020
So that's smart generalization.

200
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,490
I stay pretty close
to the tone.

201
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,470
I go for it.

202
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,970
I get further away,
eh, not so sure.

203
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,370
It's not all or none.

204
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:36,610
It's reasonably graded and
sensitive to the specifics of

205
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,200
the situation.

206
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,559
There's also one fascinating
thing, which is your acquired

207
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,150
conditioned response is
extinguished because you're

208
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,950
only hearing the bell and
there's no more food coming.

209
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:53,290
But when you come back in, you
often have a kind of preserved

210
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,900
recovery function of that CS.

211
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,050
It's like it's lurking
in you somewhere.

212
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:00,480
It's like I have a mental note
that this bell might mean

213
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,250
food, even though it
was extinguished.

214
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,590
It's still pretty interesting
stimulus.

215
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:07,300
So you'd have some easily
spontaneous recovery of these

216
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,290
kinds of learned conditioning.

217
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,990
It can also be sophisticated
in other ways.

218
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,270
And let me give you a
couple of examples.

219
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,970
You can learn to discriminate
between two things.

220
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,670
We've only talked about one
thing so far, bell, food.

221
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,920
But what if you have a black
patch, for example, that

222
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,570
predicts food coming, and a gray
one that predicts it's

223
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,990
not coming, you can distinguish
between those two.

224
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,720
You can get second order
conditioning.

225
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,080
And let me show you that.

226
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,940
The dog learns that the
bell predicts food.

227
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,180
Now, there's no food presented
for a while.

228
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,330
But there's a black patch
presented that you see

229
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,720
presented with the tone.

230
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,740
Because you know the tone
predicts food, the animal

231
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,740
figures, well, maybe this
is a pretty good hint

232
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,840
that food is coming.

233
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,740
And after a while, it begins to
salivate to this one, even

234
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:54,620
though it was never directly
paired with the food itself.

235
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,550
So it's learning.

236
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:59,340
It's a transitive inference
that it's making.

237
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,490
If the bell predicts it and the
square goes with the bell,

238
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,570
at some point I'll start
salivating for the square

239
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,120
because that sounds like a
pretty good candidate for

240
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,970
predicting the future.

241
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,590
So that's pretty sophisticated,
too.

242
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,990
You don't even have
food in this part.

243
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,730
But it's even more sophisticated
than that.

244
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,290
So look at these two things.

245
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,850
And you can think about, I'm
going to let you think about

246
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:18,820
this for a moment.

247
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,110
Here are two groups
of animals.

248
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:20,810
Or it could be people.

249
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,950
It would work just
the same way.

250
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,610
So here's the conditioned
stimulus and the unconditioned

251
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:28,360
stimulus, for example, a bell
and the food, the bell and the

252
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,920
food, the bell and the food.

253
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,600
One group only gets
bell, food, bell,

254
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,940
food kinds of pairings.

255
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,520
The other group gets
the same pairings.

256
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:41,750
But in between, they'll have a
random food reward, two random

257
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,130
bells, a random food,
random bell.

258
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,830
Now, the pairings
are identical.

259
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,560
That's what's shown in orange.

260
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,410
This group will learn better
and faster, more strongly,

261
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,290
than this group.

262
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,380
Even though they've had the
identical number of pairings.

263
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,210
Why will this group
learn more slowly?

264
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,560
Why will, even though they have
an identical number of

265
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,470
times that they got the
tone and the food, the

266
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,090
tone and the food--

267
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:04,385
Yeah?

268
00:11:04,385 --> 00:11:07,190
AUDIENCE: Is there a little bit
of extinction between--

269
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,090
PROFESSOR: It's an idea that
is an extinction between--

270
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:09,970
I think that's a good idea.

271
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,940
So that's a very good answer,
the extinction between--

272
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,650
because, when you get this
CS alone, you're

273
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,770
fighting the learning.

274
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:20,170
But it's telling you the
system is smart, right?

275
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:23,420
Because what it's kind of doing
is saying, look, eh, CS

276
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,550
alone, not always a reliable
predictor.

277
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,560
So I'll learn it.

278
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,010
But I'm not going to believe
it so strongly, right?

279
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,780
It's basically because you're
sticking extinction in between

280
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,410
those, right?

281
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,460
You're also having some trials
with the food that aren't

282
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,000
predicted either, right?

283
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,300
So it's like the animal or you
are learning what's a really

284
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,660
excellent signal.

285
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,750
And if there's other stuff in
there that gives the signal

286
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,180
not the same predictive power
for the future you learn more

287
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,360
slowly unless certainly
that relationship.

288
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:49,650
OK?

289
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,385
So that's pretty smart, too.

290
00:11:51,385 --> 00:11:55,440
Here's another way in
which it's smart.

291
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,745
And I'll tell you
the phenomenon.

292
00:11:56,745 --> 00:12:00,360
And you think about why you
think learning might work this

293
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,940
way in animals and people.

294
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,110
So pretend there's a tone that
predicts food just like we've

295
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,280
been talking about all
the way through.

296
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,600
Food stops.

297
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,850
And now you get a tone and a
light, a tone and a light, a

298
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:12,250
tone and a light.

299
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,840
The tone predicts it's food.

300
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,800
You're getting this
part, again,

301
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,850
without food being presented.

302
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,870
And now you get the
light alone.

303
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,340
OK?

304
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:24,440
Or everything's the same.

305
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,620
But there isn't the initial
learning with the tone.

306
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,230

307
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,250
And then in the end you're
tested for the lights.

308
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,890
And what happens is there's less
conditioning to the light

309
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:37,280
here than here, even though
you've seen a light an exact

310
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,570
even number of times.

311
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:44,170
Why is the conditioning to
the light weaker here?

312
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,920
Why is it weaker
here than here?

313
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,960

314
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,260
This is an information problem
for the brain to solve about

315
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:57,480
the truth of the world.

316
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,740
Well, our interpretation
is this.

317
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,250
Tone, food, tone, food, you
go, good, I got it.

318
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,530
Easy, right?

319
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:06,290
Now you get tone and light
together for a while.

320
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,930
And you go, OK, I know the
tone is really important.

321
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,100
The light, I don't know.

322
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,580
The tone was perfectly good.

323
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,760
The light seems redundant,
informationally redundant.

324
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,500
So now when it's a light alone,
you don't have so much

325
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:19,920
conditioning.

326
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,150
Because you didn't care about
the light so much.

327
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,580
The food had all the information
you needed.

328
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,250
The light was informationally
redundant, right?

329
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,880
It was superfluous.

330
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,590
Here you only got trained with
the tone and the lights.

331
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:33,490
So you never made a bet on
what's the critical thing.

332
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,210
They both predicted evenly.

333
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,650
So when the light comes by
itself, that was always

334
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,430
something that seemed like a
pretty good signal equally

335
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,760
good to the tone.

336
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,935
So that's very sophisticated
that the animal learning it or

337
00:13:44,935 --> 00:13:46,930
the human learning it is
deciding what's the

338
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,880
information that's diagnostic
and what's the information

339
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,520
that's redundant.

340
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,560
And it's conditioning
across that, right?

341
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,700
So it's not just very
simple reflexes.

342
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,950
It's sophisticated learning.

343
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:59,260

344
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,720
So now I'm going to
switch gears.

345
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,640
So we're going to have a
demonstration that involves

346
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:07,660
the opposite of fearful things
like spraying water and

347
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,610
popping balloons.

348
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,390
But I can't tell you too
much about this.

349
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:14,620
But I can tell you it'll
be pretty pleasant.

350
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,010
But I need somebody who's
willing to step out of the

351
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,740
room for a moment to do this.

352
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,545
OK, thanks.

353
00:14:20,545 --> 00:14:22,630
Yeah, yeah, you can safely
take off your jacket now.

354
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:28,090

355
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,050
And what's your name?

356
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:30,730
AUDIENCE: I'm Sam.

357
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,270
PROFESSOR: Sam, OK.

358
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,300
Try not to listen
if possible, OK?

359
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,550
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

360
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,596

361
00:14:37,596 --> 00:14:40,780
PROFESSOR: So you guys are
going to help me perform

362
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,580
instrumental conditioning.

363
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,430
And then we'll discuss
what that is.

364
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:48,470
Our job is to have Sam come over
here and pick this up.

365
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,230
OK?

366
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:54,490
Your job, as Sam comes in for
every action he takes, a step

367
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,100
this way, you played this game
as a kid, or an arm going in

368
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,230
the right direction, applaud if
he's doing something that

369
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,460
gets him closer to the goal of
picking up the brain and

370
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,225
withhold your applause if he's
doing something that's taking

371
00:15:06,225 --> 00:15:07,170
him away from that.

372
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:07,790
Is that OK?

373
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,040
All right, OK.

374
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,530

375
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:15,610
So we're going to discuss what
instrumental conditioning is.

376
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,740
And then we're going to slightly
think philosophically

377
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,610
about whether this is how you
learn to do everything.

378
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:24,710
You get to choose who the
applause comes from, your

379
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:29,530
parents, your family, your
friends, medical schools and

380
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,790
law schools and graduate
schools.

381
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,570
You get to choose who the
applause comes from, about how

382
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:37,600
much of our lives is responding
to the applause

383
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,630
that we care about.

384
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,170
So we'll start more simply,
less philosophically.

385
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:41,880
Let's think about this.

386
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,120
The examples we talked so far in
classical conditioning all

387
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,900
build on what feels like a basic
reflex, salivating for

388
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,550
food, flinching for
water, right?

389
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:55,310
So if we ask somebody, why do
you work hard, there's not to

390
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,780
be very good explanation in
terms of those initial

391
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,240
reflexes, right?

392
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,010
You're not flinching.

393
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:02,820
You're not looking for
food or water.

394
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,680
And yet much of our life is
involved in endeavors that we

395
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,850
learn where there's no primary
reflex that we

396
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,400
can see in the story.

397
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,320
And so operant or instrumental
conditioning, those two words

398
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,320
are interchangeable, is the way
that psychologists have

399
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,250
tried to understand those
forms of learning.

400
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,990
And it began something
like this.

401
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:24,060
And this is from Thorndike.

402
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,810
He put a cat into
a puzzle box.

403
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,250
I'll show you what the box looks
like or a sketch of it.

404
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,890
The cat had to unlatch a door
by pulling a latch.

405
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,370
So here's, the cat's
in a box like this.

406
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:37,250
To get out, which cat wants to
get out, he or she has to push

407
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,590
this, which will
push the latch.

408
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,950
Now, that's not obvious
to a cat.

409
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,570
It wouldn't be necessarily
obvious to a person but

410
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,670
definitely not obvious
to a cat.

411
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,650
And the animal learned it by
trial and error sort of like

412
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,830
Sam did, right?

413
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:53,510
And where is the unconditioned
stimulus?

414
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:56,230
There's no salivation or
any reward like that.

415
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:00,090
So Thorndike proposed that
people and animals learn

416
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,550
things by the consequence
of their response.

417
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,970
And the Law of Effect says the
consequence of a response

418
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,540
determines whether it is
strengthened or weakened.

419
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,339
You can be rewarded.

420
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:09,520
That will strengthen
a response.

421
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,349
You can have no reward.

422
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:11,010
That will weaken it.

423
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:11,930
You can be punished.

424
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,790
That will greatly weaken
the response.

425
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:15,859
So here's the cat.

426
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:17,500
Here's an example of a cat.

427
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,260
At first, it takes a long time
for the cat to get out of

428
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,520
there as it tries different
things.

429
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,240
But over repeated trials,
the cat can get out

430
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,440
really, really fast.

431
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:30,080
And how Thorndike, by
observation and thinking,

432
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,330
thought about it was at the
beginning the animal

433
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,100
wants to get out.

434
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,670
It has no idea how
it gets out.

435
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,470
So it does everything it can.

436
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,700
It scratches at the bars.

437
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,750
It pushes at the ceiling.

438
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,520
It digs through the floor.

439
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,360
It howls.

440
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,300
And at some moment, it
presses a lever.

441
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,300
And that's good, right?

442
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,950
So here's different things the
animal starts with thinking

443
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,110
might be good ideas.

444
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,030
But because it discovers with
repeated efforts, repeated

445
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,250
trials, that pressing the lever

446
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,390
works, these get weakened.

447
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,480
This gets strengthened.

448
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,010
So the consequence of a response
determines whether

449
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,900
it's strengthened or weakened.

450
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,450
And now there's no salivating
or reflex or

451
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,280
anything like that.

452
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,780
You can learn then
almost anything.

453
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,450

454
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:11,420
So this was picked up
a lot in the US.

455
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,670
John Watson is a famous name.

456
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:18,410
You'll see kind of a haunting
film of him performing this

457
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,730
kinds of stuff with infants in
a kind of a way that we would

458
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,980
never allow ethically now.

459
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,530
It's not horrible.

460
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,590
But it's pretty bad.

461
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,790
But it's a famous thing.

462
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,790
And you'll just get a feeling
of the power of this.

463
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:31,870
Behaviorism, that if you study
behavior, instead of going for

464
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:35,200
things like unobservable
thoughts, that you would just

465
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,350
do observable actions.

466
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,310
And you wouldn't make inferences
about the mind that

467
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,420
you can't measure.

468
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,600
You make a stimulus.

469
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,760
You measure the response.

470
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,400
And that's it.

471
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,480
No fundamental differences
between animals and humans,

472
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,570
and you make laws that describe
the relationships

473
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:50,260
between stimulating the
environment and physical

474
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,980
behaviors that you can observe
or responses out in the world

475
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,830
that an organism has.

476
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,010
So I'll come back to
this a little bit.

477
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,620
But one of the ways he wanted
to show that anybody could

478
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,920
learn anything, because right
now, don't forget, the way we

479
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,920
set this up, anybody
can learn anything.

480
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,060
You can applaud anything,
right?

481
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:12,230
So you can teach anybody
anything by this perspective.

482
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,010
And he wanted to show that
he could teach an infant

483
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,500
initially, whose name
was Little Albert.

484
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,040
That was his cover name.

485
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,255
Nobody actually knows his real
name or what happened to him.

486
00:19:22,255 --> 00:19:24,501
Well, nothing horrible happened
to this person we

487
00:19:24,501 --> 00:19:25,130
know about.

488
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:28,200
And now you would never do
an experiment like this.

489
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,310
You have this in your notes.

490
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:33,530
This is a long version of the
movies taken of this actual

491
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:35,900
sort of experiment that
we wouldn't do now.

492
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,590
And I'll show you a short
version in a couple minutes

493
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,475
where he got an infant to become
afraid of a rabbit that

494
00:19:40,475 --> 00:19:44,130
the infant previously
was not afraid of.

495
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,180
And then the other huge name
in this is B.F. Skinner who

496
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:50,810
worked at Harvard, consequence
of a response, again, creates

497
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:52,380
the responses that we
make in the world.

498
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,310
And his sense response is not
just the laboratory one but

499
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,762
things we do in the world with
each other and to each other.

500
00:19:58,762 --> 00:20:01,240
And so the classical
conditioning, the

501
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,130
CS elicits the CR.

502
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,520
The conditioned stimulus, the
bell, elicits the conditioned

503
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,820
response, salivation.

504
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,820
But in instrumental conditioning
CRs are omitted.

505
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,410
And you can do really anything
that's in the range of what an

506
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,160
organism can do.

507
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,410
And then he could show kind of
impressively how you might

508
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,550
imagine a chain of these
things would

509
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,440
lead to complex behaviors.

510
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,010
So he would teach pigeons and
other animals to first to

511
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,500
click to get a pellet, then
where to click it, then to

512
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,370
where to face before
you click it.

513
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,670
And he would just keep adding
little pieces, shape the

514
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:34,560
pieces up from the first step
to the second step, until he

515
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,120
got pretty complex behaviors.

516
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,050
OK, so now I'm going to show a
slightly longer clip that has

517
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,580
in it these kinds of experiments
and Little Albert.

518
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,700

519
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:54,180
It's kind of cool because in the
sense that we can actually

520
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,260
see films of these sort of
historical things, which often

521
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,995
we don't get to do in various
science fields.

522
00:20:57,995 --> 00:21:07,800

523
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:13,330
So let's talk about that
for just one moment.

524
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:16,315
So we can talk about primary
reinforcers like food, thrist,

525
00:21:16,315 --> 00:21:18,830
or pain, things that go with
life, right, pain, not being

526
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,300
injured, food, and thirst.

527
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,820
We can talk about secondary
reinforcers that we know a lot

528
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:28,520
about, money, attention of
other people, praise from

529
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,820
other people, admissions to
places you want to be admitted

530
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,000
to, promotions when you
want to get them.

531
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,020
There can be positive
or negative rewards.

532
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,890
And I'm going talk
about one thing.

533
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:42,280
But just for a moment the
behaviorists said anybody can

534
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,390
learn anything, right?

535
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:46,260
We'll come back to that.

536
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:50,050
So that's been a big debate
whether anything can be

537
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,890
equally learned with
any other thing.

538
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:56,180
And the other thing that's
striking is B.F. Skinner

539
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,070
particularly said that we have
an illusion of free will, that

540
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,760
all we are, are learning
these things.

541
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,330
And we might as well get over
our illusion of free will.

542
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:07,590
Scientifically, it's very hard
for even the best scientific

543
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,120
psychologists to tell
you whether free

544
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,270
will exists or not.

545
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,290
That's not something that's
easy for us to begin to

546
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,440
imagine how to measure.

547
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,230
These kinds of learning
things are very

548
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,160
impressive in many ways.

549
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,410
And we'll talk about
some of that.

550
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,940

551
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:27,610
So let me talk to you about one
way in which, for example,

552
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:31,120
casinos get people to come back
often and other things in

553
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,930
life, without giving you
money every time.

554
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:36,220
Because then they wouldn't
make money, right?

555
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,320
So your book talks about a
number of examples of this.

556
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,070
But I'll just pick one,
partial reinforcement.

557
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:44,290
So this means when do you get,
in these animals, when do you

558
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,160
get a reward?

559
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,070
Every time or only
1/3 of the time?

560
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:52,290
So of course, you learn faster
if you get a reward every time

561
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,350
than if it's 1/3 of the time.

562
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,020
You're not quite as impressed
and excited.

563
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,510
But here's the interesting
thing.

564
00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:00,080
If you stop giving the reward,
these animals will go on for

565
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,390
quite a while before
they extinguish.

566
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,590
These animals will extinguish
right away and stop

567
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,330
responding.

568
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:10,360
Why will these animals keep
behaving for a time, even

569
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,210
though you've entirely
stopped the rewards?

570
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:14,560
Yeah?

571
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,760
AUDIENCE: Since they only got it
30% of the time anyway, it

572
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,040
seems plausible to them that
it would go a couple more

573
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,380
times without them getting it.

574
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,630
PROFESSOR: Yes, since they
only got, the answer was,

575
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:26,760
which was right, they only got
it 30% of the time, so the

576
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,010
first one or two nonpayments,
right, they're going to go,

577
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:33,090
well, it's coming up next, OK,
in a couple more, OK, I'm

578
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:36,600
coming up soon until they
finally decide that the whole

579
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,270
thing is over, right?

580
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:41,000
So that's very interesting, the
different reinforcement

581
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,720
schedules, how they relate.

582
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,390
You might think, well, you
always learn better if you

583
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,150
reward more.

584
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,950
But in some cases, if you want
to get people to keep doing

585
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:51,810
stuff without direct reward,
partial reinforcement is

586
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:54,770
actually more powerful.

587
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,720
Now we're going to move into
dog experiments and then

588
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,340
directly to sort of
thinking about

589
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,260
people and our own lives.

590
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,910
So this is a famous, famous
experiment at the University

591
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,200
of Pennsylvania from Seligman.

592
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,460
In this case, he used dogs.

593
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,840
It's been done with many species
in many circumstances.

594
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,070
And he put them in a hammock.

595
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,430
So there's two dogs on two sides
of a thing that they

596
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,130
walked around.

597
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:16,170
And they don't see each other.

598
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:21,850
The dog, A, would periodically
get a shock.

599
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:25,670
And it could stop the shock by
pushing a panel near its nose.

600
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,560
As soon as the shock came,
it could turn its nose

601
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,390
and stop the shock.

602
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:33,930
Dog B on the other side of the
divider would get exactly the

603
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,910
same shock.

604
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:37,370
It would stop at exactly the
moment that the first dog

605
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:38,740
stopped it.

606
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:42,370
But dog B had no direct control,
equal number of

607
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:45,610
shocks, equal duration of
objective pain, if you want to

608
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:46,610
call it that way.

609
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,180
One animal has the capacity
to stop it.

610
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,000
The other does not.

611
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,060
So that's the first part
of the experiment.

612
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,840
And the second part of the
experiment they're put into a

613
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,090
shuttle box.

614
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:58,420

615
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:01,890
It's just a box with a big
divider in the middle.

616
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,510
And they're just hanging
out there.

617
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,510
And then they hear a tone.

618
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:07,450
At first, it means
nothing to them.

619
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:11,370
And then comes a shock on
the grid on the floor.

620
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:13,850
And at first, they don't
know what to do.

621
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,900
But then after a while, they
get smart like the cat.

622
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,120
And they jump over the divider
to the other side.

623
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,020
And it's all OK.

624
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,680
So you can imagine that when
they hear the tone pretty

625
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,860
quickly that what do
they learn to do?

626
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,860
Jump over the divider
and stop the pain.

627
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,040
And here's the remarkable
thing.

628
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,910
For the animals who had the
experience that pushing the

629
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:35,290
panel stopped the pain, they
learned that pretty quickly.

630
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:39,800
For the animals who could not
stop the pain initially, they

631
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,680
don't learn how to escape
when they could.

632
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,030
It's as if the animals in group
B, what they learned

633
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:48,580
about life, it's painful.

634
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,820
And you can't do anything
about it.

635
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:55,030
The animals in group A
learned pain happens.

636
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:58,560
But I can do something
about it.

637
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,190
So here's the animal.

638
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:02,030
At first, it doesn't
know what to do.

639
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:02,870
It's getting the shock.

640
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:06,400
But with trials, the animal
learns to jump and jump so

641
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,990
quickly that it doesn't have
almost any problem.

642
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:08,720
Here's a tone, boom.

643
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,710
It's out of there.

644
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,730
It learns to avoid the pain.

645
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:14,620
But what happens to the animals
who either had the

646
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,240
escapable shock or the ones?

647
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,400
The ones who could poke their
nose, they also learned this.

648
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,350
The ones who could jump over,
there's nothing preventing

649
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,780
them from learning that.

650
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,490
They just don't escape.

651
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:30,950
It's what Seligman called
learned helplessness, that the

652
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:34,550
animals learn, from the first
experience, their conclusion

653
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,350
was pain happens.

654
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,840
And I can't do anything
about it.

655
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,600
And then when they get in a
second situation where they

656
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,060
can do a lot about it, they
continue to feel helpless and

657
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,220
not do something about it.

658
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,620
It's like a deep lesson about
life, like when do you think

659
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,000
you can make your situation
better and when do you think

660
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,600
there's nothing I
can do about it?

661
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,140
It's just bad, bad, bad.

662
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,700

663
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,010
So there's ideas about that some
of this might be related

664
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:59,720
to people who struggle with
depression but also other

665
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,290
things in life.

666
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:03,820
So here's the idea from Seligman
as an explanation of

667
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,460
how we have resilience.

668
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:10,310
The idea is that we all get in
sometimes in small doses,

669
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,590
sometimes in tragically
large doses, difficult

670
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,940
things into our lives.

671
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,630
How do we explain those
difficulties that have

672
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,930
happened to us, the
setbacks we have?

673
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,780
Do we think they're
internal to us?

674
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,980
I'm the kind of person
who has bad luck.

675
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,050
I'm the kind of person that
these things happen to.

676
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,420
Or is it external?

677
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:29,440
Somebody gave me a test.

678
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,380
What can I do about that?

679
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,630
But next week the
test is over.

680
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:32,990
And life will be better.

681
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,730
Is it global or specific?

682
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,610
Does it just seem miserable
all over?

683
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:39,960
Or is it just one specific
squirt in the face that this

684
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,680
faculty member gave me?

685
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,210
Is it stable or unstable?

686
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:45,720
Are bad things just seeming
to happen all the time?

687
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,340
Or is it one occasion?

688
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,590
And you can imagine that people
who believe that bad

689
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,220
things are internal,
global, and stable

690
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,520
will learn to be helpless.

691
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,770
Everything seems dark
and hopeless.

692
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:59,330
People who believe that things
are external, specific, and

693
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:01,830
unstable think, the next
time I can do better.

694
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,840
I can bounce back from
this and do better.

695
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,470
And it's not only in terms of
the sort of spirit of people

696
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:09,740
and trying to get people to
bounce back from setbacks.

697
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,770
It's even things like
job applications.

698
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:14,050
Seligman did the
following bet.

699
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,840
I don't even know what
corresponds to it before.

700
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,290
But there used to be an era when
people would go knock on

701
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,670
doors and try to sell
you insurance.

702
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:20,590
We don't do that
anymore, right?

703
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,025
Because if somebody comes to our
door, knocks on our door,

704
00:28:22,025 --> 00:28:23,860
we're calling the police.

705
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,650
But when things were more
calm, you'd open

706
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:27,700
the door and talk.

707
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,240
Or they would give you cold
calls, which you don't get

708
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,340
much more anymore these days.

709
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:34,760
You guys, have you ever even
heard that phrase?

710
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,940
You'd work at some insurance
company.

711
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,590
And you'd go, here's some random
telephone numbers.

712
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,370
You call them up.

713
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:40,430
And you try to sell
them insurance.

714
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:42,150
Usually, you get abused
on the phone.

715
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:43,440
Or somebody slams the doors.

716
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,980
But these salespeople, they
make commissions.

717
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:45,850
And they keep going.

718
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,690
And he said, let
me get my test.

719
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,780
He gave a questionnaire whether
people interpret the

720
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,750
world one way or the other way,
the resilient way or the

721
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,190
learned helplessness way.

722
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:57,490
And you give your usual
interview way for picking

723
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:58,250
sales people.

724
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,230
And let me see who picks
a better salesperson.

725
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,810
And his questionnaire picked
a better salesperson.

726
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:06,340
Because if you have a sales job
where people often kick

727
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,970
you out and hang up on you, you
better be pretty external,

728
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:12,430
specific, and unstable in your
perception on things, right?

729
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:15,300
Because when you have 100 people
who hang up on you or

730
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,970
close the door on you for one
sale, you need to have a thick

731
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:20,500
resilient skin.

732
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,350
So there's lots of ways in which
I think this speaks to

733
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:27,680
how do we respond to the
setbacks in our lives.

734
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,120
So let me talk about some
limits to conditioning.

735
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,490
And some of these that I think
touch also on what are the

736
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:34,910
values by which we
lead our lives.

737
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:36,690
It's not going to be
telling you that.

738
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:39,550
But it'll make you think about
some of the mechanics of what

739
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,850
matters to you.

740
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:42,800
So let me slide back
for a moment.

741
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,050
So the behaviorists said
everybody can learn

742
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:45,520
everything.

743
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,790
Everybody can learn
everything.

744
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,720
In that sense, it was seen
as a very democratic and

745
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,510
egalitarian perspective.

746
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,020
Everybody can learn
everything.

747
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,270
It's just how you set up the
contingencies in the

748
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,380
environment.

749
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:59,920
And then Garcia did a famous
experiment where he had rats

750
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,940
get shocks or receive
lithium chloride,

751
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,830
which made them nauseous.

752
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:10,590
And they either had a bright
noisy stimulus.

753
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:13,770
Or they tasted some
sweet water.

754
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:17,030
And even though these things
were arbitrarily combined, the

755
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:21,990
rats learned, who received
shocked, learn to fear the

756
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:25,060
bright noise, the bright
light and the noise.

757
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,860
And the rats who got the lithium
chloride that made

758
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,360
them nauseous learned to
fear the sweet water.

759
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,520
Do you see why?

760
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,720
When we get nauseous, do we
think like, boy, it was noisy

761
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,150
last night?

762
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:37,310
Or do you think, when you wake
up in the morning and you feel

763
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,890
nauseous, what's the first
thing you think?

764
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:42,650
PROFESSOR: Yeah, something I
ate, right, we're prepared for

765
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:47,740
internal nausea to think
about food as a risk.

766
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,830
And if it's a shock, we're
prepared to think of

767
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,430
something out there.

768
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:54,560
So these animals instinctively,
not on the

769
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:59,730
basis of the training,
instinctively said, if I feel

770
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:02,660
a shock, it's probably related
to this bright noisy stimulus

771
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,880
that warns me.

772
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,460
If I feel nauseous, it's related
to the sugar water.

773
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,190
And they had these opposite
patterns of learning for the

774
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:14,780
stimuli as if these animals
were prepared to fear some

775
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:15,860
things and not others.

776
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,670
So it wasn't that everything
could be matched with

777
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:18,150
everything.

778
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:20,620
And in fact, with humans,
they've done things like show

779
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,680
you pictures either of
snakes and spiders

780
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,260
or flowers and mushrooms.

781
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,420
And then those predicted
a shock, a

782
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,900
small shock to humans.

783
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,820
And they measured your galvanic
skin response and

784
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,020
autonomic response.

785
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,950
When you think you're going to
get a shock, you start to get

786
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,790
a little sweaty.

787
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,170
And what they found was--

788
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:38,840
and this will not shock you--
they had better conditioning,

789
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,330
you more quickly and completely
learned that a

790
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:43,810
snake or a spider predicts
a shock than

791
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,740
a flower or a mushroom.

792
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:49,620
Even though, objectively, they
were just as predictive.

793
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:52,280
There's something about snakes
and spiders that gets us ready

794
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,660
for scary stuff.

795
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,830
And flowers and mushrooms, they
really have to punish us

796
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:59,820
before we think they're evil
signals so, again, a human

797
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,110
example of preparedness.

798
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,530
We don't learn everything
equally.

799
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:05,480
We are prepared to learn some
things and not others.

800
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:09,050
Same thing with Little Albert,
the child that you saw, that

801
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,320
kind of a film has
a funny status.

802
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,500
And we'll talk about a few
more things this semester

803
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,920
where that experiment,
why should that

804
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,520
experiment not be done?

805
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,890

806
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:20,420
Yeah?

807
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,430
AUDIENCE: Nobody knows what
happened to Little Albert.

808
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:25,640
PROFESSOR: Yeah, well, you would
never terrorize a child,

809
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,290
right, to scare the child.

810
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:31,860
So weirdly enough, though, these
studies remain in the

811
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,000
field because since we
can't do them again.

812
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,470
Because we know they're
not right to do.

813
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,330
We try to learn lessons
from them so

814
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:39,730
that we learn something.

815
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:42,190
The rat worked.

816
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,560
He got scared of a rat.

817
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,640
And then he got scared
of a bunny.

818
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,930
He got scared of
a cat, anything

819
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:48,390
animal, anything furry.

820
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:51,690
But if they gave him a wooden
block, that didn't work.

821
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:52,925
It's not everything.

822
00:32:52,925 --> 00:32:56,550
It has to be prepared
from that.

823
00:32:56,550 --> 00:33:02,440
Here's another one that also
challenges simple ideas of do

824
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,700
we always learn simply
to get a reward.

825
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,170
What kind of learning might
exist that's rewardless?

826
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:12,160
So there's three groups of
rats in a goal maze.

827
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,470
There's food rewards every
day for one group.

828
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,420
They're the happy group.

829
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,160
There's no rewards for
a grumbling group.

830
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,220
There's a third group that gets
no reward for 10 days.

831
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,630
And then it gets reward.

832
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:25,160
So reward all the time, reward
never, no reward for 10 days

833
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,260
and then you start to get
rewards all the time, and

834
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,930
here's what happens
to the learning.

835
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:31,950
If you look at this green line,
that's the food that

836
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:32,970
gets rewarded all the time.

837
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:37,010
So they make fewer errors
so they can

838
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:39,100
get to the food faster.

839
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,480
If you look at the group that's
never rewarded, this

840
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,515
yellow line, it's
pretty steady.

841
00:33:42,515 --> 00:33:45,510
It's like I'm hanging out,
no reason to go anywhere.

842
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,080
There's not much going on.

843
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,720
Look at the orange group.

844
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,120
For 10 days, up to here, they
look like the yellow line,

845
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,860
right, not getting rewarded.

846
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,090
I'm just going to
saunter around.

847
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:56,800
There's nothing interesting
to learn here.

848
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:01,030
But boom that first day that
it's rewarded, but just one

849
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,765
day of learning, they're
all caught up.

850
00:34:02,765 --> 00:34:04,470
They're all caught up.

851
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:07,000
So people call this latent
learning, that they were

852
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,340
really learning a lot about
their environment anyway, even

853
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,350
though it was of no
use at the moment.

854
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:15,540
And then the moment it became
valuable information, boom,

855
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,100
they're all caught up.

856
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,414
It's as if they learned
all this information.

857
00:34:18,414 --> 00:34:19,420
And it was ready to go.

858
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:22,510
Latent learning, the information
is stored up just

859
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,810
because they were in the
environment, even though it

860
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:24,800
was unrewarded.

861
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,980
And as we go around, we often
pick up stuff, even though

862
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,300
there's no direct reward.

863
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,460
And sometimes it turns
out to be useful.

864
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,670
People also love, humans,
including infants,

865
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:37,150
contingency, the idea that
we feel like we have

866
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,909
control over our world.

867
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:42,389
So here's a two-month-old
infant, very young infant, in

868
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:44,400
a little experiment where they
put the infant in a crib.

869
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,500
And above is a very colorful
colored mobile.

870
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,620
And in one version, when the
infant moves his or her head,

871
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,650
there's a switch
in the pillow.

872
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:54,810
The mobile moves.

873
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:56,429
And the infants are smiling
and cooing.

874
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:56,889
They love it.

875
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:57,570
This is awesome.

876
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:58,190
They move their head.

877
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:00,020
The thing moves, pretty
impressive for a two-month.

878
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,630
All they can do is wiggle
their head, right?

879
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:04,130
They're not walking
or anything.

880
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:08,740
They put another group of
infants in who have no switch.

881
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:12,940
And just periodically, they
turn on the mobile.

882
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,570
There's no smiling
and no cooing.

883
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,190
And they equate the number
of mobile turnings.

884
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,250
Why is that?

885
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,730
Well, if it's just because you
like the mobile turning, then

886
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:23,050
you should have both groups be
equaling cooing and smiling or

887
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:23,760
disinterested.

888
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,950
But there's something
fundamentally rewarding for

889
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:29,280
humans, even at the age of two,
to feel like they have

890
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,270
control over their environment
and their pleasures.

891
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,160
And that's not explained
by conditioning.

892
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,130
Nobody's getting
anything more.

893
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:37,690
They're both seeing the equal
number of interesting turns.

894
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:39,590
But one group feels like they're
controlling their

895
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,050
environment.

896
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:43,580
Here's another one that I'm
going to show you in an animal

897
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,890
experiment where you
can control things.

898
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:48,020
But you can imagine
in your own life.

899
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:51,260
In my life, I see this
all the time.

900
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:54,500
It's nice when something
pleasant happens in your life

901
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,590
and your situation gets better
in some way, right?

902
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,220
You get a better iPad, right?

903
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,840

904
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,970
But how hard is it emotionally
when something gets worse?

905
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:11,460
They take all your iPads away
or more serious things.

906
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:15,060
When things get worse, often
we feel pretty miserable.

907
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,560
And here's a neat
example of that.

908
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,400
So these are rats in an
experiment so everything's

909
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,250
controlled.

910
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,840
So here's one group of rats.

911
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,220
This is how quickly
they're running.

912
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,150
So it's good to be high.

913
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,060
One group of rats is
constantly getting

914
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,290
one pellet a day.

915
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:29,280
So they learn what to do.

916
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,650
And they're sort of hanging
out here doing well.

917
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:34,500
A second group of rats is the
luckiest group of all.

918
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,430
They get eight pellets.

919
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,940
And they learn more.

920
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,370
But they flatten out.

921
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:39,800
So you get more reward.

922
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,480
You drive the behavior more.

923
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,770
That's not unexpected.

924
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:45,930
The interesting thing are
the two contrast groups.

925
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:48,810
The contrast groups start
off with one or eight.

926
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:51,030
And then, after a couple days,
they're flipped around.

927
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,910
So some started with one.

928
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,370
Then they got eight pellets.

929
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:55,930
Others started with eight.

930
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:56,680
Then they got one.

931
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,920
Does that make sense?

932
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,110
So here's the contrast
group of eight.

933
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,026
They're learning one.

934
00:37:02,026 --> 00:37:05,230
They go eight, woo.

935
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,360
They're happy.

936
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,230
They're getting eight.

937
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,670
Life got good.

938
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:11,000
Look at the group for
whom life got worse.

939
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,990
I'm getting eight.

940
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:12,890
I'm getting eight.

941
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:13,720
I'm getting eight.

942
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,360
I'm getting one.

943
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,060
I'm getting one.

944
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:15,700
I'm getting one.

945
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,360
It really stinks.

946
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,350
They're actually worse than the
groups that got one all

947
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,920
along, right?

948
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,560
This is the lowest
line of all.

949
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,770
They're protesting.

950
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:26,420
This stinks.

951
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,140
I was getting eight.

952
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:27,890
Now I'm getting one.

953
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,120
What a rip off.

954
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,130
What kind of world
do I live in?

955
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:33,080
So the learning is
protesting that.

956
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,850
Now, by purely conditioning
one, why would

957
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:36,920
this group be worse?

958
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,340
They're still getting
a pellet.

959
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,610
But because they're interpreting
it as a world

960
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:45,570
that's going downhill, as a
worsening situation, they're

961
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:46,980
less prone to learn it.

962
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,520
They're sort of protesting in
their learning, things having

963
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,950
gotten worse in the world.

964
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:54,820

965
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,860
A really interesting theme along
the line of this reward,

966
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,810
an unbelievable one that has
gotten a lot of attention, is

967
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,500
delayed gratification.

968
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,380
If you think about it, and the
analysis is not purely

969
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,980
scientific but is a theme,
delayed gratification is a

970
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:11,550
spectacular part of your life,
right, especially if you go

971
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,630
through higher education.

972
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,700
Or maybe everything is
like this, right?

973
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,760
Do a good job in primary thing
and you'll get to a good

974
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,180
middle school.

975
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,740
Do a good job in middle school,
we'll get to a good

976
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,170
high school.

977
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:20,710
Do a good job in high school,
you get to MIT.

978
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:23,990
Do a good job at MIT, you go to
med school or law school or

979
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:25,120
become a teacher, whatever
you want to do.

980
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,240
A good job at that and you'll
get to this thing.

981
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,100
Do a good job of that, finally,
thank you very

982
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:29,890
much, you're 95.

983
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,140
And you're done.

984
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,960

985
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,640
I mean it's kind of like you
guys are waiting a long time

986
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,640
between the efforts you're
doing and what you might

987
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:43,410
consider a palpable reward.

988
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:45,950
So here's a fantastically
interesting study from Walter

989
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:48,310
Mischel done at Stanford
some years ago.

990
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:51,160
These children were four
to five years old.

991
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,490
There were about 600
that were studied.

992
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:55,110
They were mostly the children
of faculty and graduate

993
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:57,680
students at Stanford.

994
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,430
And they would come
into a room.

995
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,740
And the experiment, slightly
varied, was

996
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,490
basically like this.

997
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:03,530
They would sit in front
of either a cookie or

998
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:04,080
marshmallow.

999
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,400
They used different rewards.

1000
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,910
But imagine it's
a marshmallow.

1001
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:09,930
In the movie I'll show you,
it's Oreo cookies.

1002
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,890
And they were told this.

1003
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:16,170
And they tried to make this,
Walter Mischel who did the

1004
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:18,390
experiment describes how he
played with kids to try to get

1005
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:22,010
the marshmallow look
really awesome.

1006
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:24,620
And the kid would sit there,
the four or five-year-old.

1007
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,670
And they were told, I'm going
to leave the room now.

1008
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,860
And there's a bell here.

1009
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:30,970
If you really want to eat that
marshmallow, ring the bell and

1010
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,410
just eat it.

1011
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,200
But if you wait a while--

1012
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,800
they didn't tell them
it was 15 minutes.

1013
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,470
It was 15 minutes.

1014
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,050
I'll come back.

1015
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,410
And I'll give you two.

1016
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:41,680
Delayed gratification, I can
have one marshmallow now.

1017
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,750
Or if I hang in there for 15
minutes and don't touch it, I

1018
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,070
can get two.

1019
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:49,380
Let me tell you the results.

1020
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,230
And then let me show
a film of this.

1021
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,960
When I was looking on YouTube
and the internet and stuff,

1022
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,540
there's a lot of posed
movies out there.

1023
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:58,630
This is the only one I found
from Walter Mischel himself

1024
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,970
that's a real movie of real
kids really doing this.

1025
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:03,700
I don't know why all the ones
are posed out there.

1026
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,340
But here's something
astounding.

1027
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,640
So these are all pretty similar

1028
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,290
children, children of faculty.

1029
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:12,550
Children varied how long
they could wait.

1030
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:14,180
And if they took, for example,
the children who

1031
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,290
didn't wait very long.

1032
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:16,690
They could only wait
30 seconds until

1033
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:17,910
they ate the cookie.

1034
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,680
And they compared them to the
children who would wait for

1035
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,470
the full 15 minutes
to eat the cookie.

1036
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,470
These are four and
five-year-olds.

1037
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:27,230
When they looked at them at 18
and their SATs, the children

1038
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:30,800
who would wait 15 minutes scored
over 200 points higher,

1039
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,210
which you know is a lot.

1040
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:34,000
That was in the days we just
had two SAT tests.

1041
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,550
So it was 1,600.

1042
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:41,400
And by many, many measures
in terms of educational

1043
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,320
attainment, in terms of health,
and many measures, the

1044
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,890
longer you waited at age four
or five, the healthier you

1045
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:51,220
were, the better SAT scores you
were, the further you went

1046
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,790
in school, astounding
correlations

1047
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:56,380
with real life stuff.

1048
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,630
And people are stunned
by this.

1049
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,700
Partly, it's again, who
knows what goes into

1050
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,540
that at four or five.

1051
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,960
How much is the influence
of parents?

1052
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,330
How much is the influence
of cultures and genes?

1053
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,170
Who knows?

1054
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:09,010
But that fateful moment when
the child goes for the

1055
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:12,410
marshmallow or not correlates
with incredibly important

1056
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:14,370
outcomes in the future.

1057
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:16,050
So let's see.

1058
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,300
Here we go.

1059
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:24,070

1060
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:28,220
And you know, right, every
college I remember personally,

1061
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,325
it was always a battle,
like am I going

1062
00:41:30,325 --> 00:41:31,200
to have fun or study?

1063
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,220
Am I going to have
fun or study?

1064
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,600
There's so many chances
to have fun.

1065
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,100
And there's so many pressures
to study, right?

1066
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:39,480
Well, studying can be fun.

1067
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,030
Learning is fun.

1068
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,220
How about when rewards harm?

1069
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,290
Again, these are things that are
not strictly predicted by

1070
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:45,160
conditioning.

1071
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,660
I have three or four
more minutes.

1072
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:50,100
So rats love to run, if you had
a hamster or anything like

1073
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,540
that, they love running
wheels.

1074
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:56,030
What if you give them, every
time they run, a food reward?

1075
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:58,540
Then it turns out rats no
longer run for fun.

1076
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:01,870
They only run when the
food is given.

1077
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:04,350
If you start to extinguish,
they stop running.

1078
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:07,270
So what had been a natural thing
that seemed like a whole

1079
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:11,180
lot of fun, if it became the
price you pay for a reward,

1080
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,490
all a sudden becomes a chore.

1081
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:15,780

1082
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:20,870
A widely cited experiment
for Mark Lepper, he took

1083
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:24,220
preschoolers, so four-year-old
children, who love to draw.

1084
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:27,220
Lots of preschoolers
love to draw.

1085
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,760
Then they started to give
them, every time they

1086
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,300
drew, a gold star.

1087
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,950
Every time they got a reward.

1088
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,570
What happened when they stopped
given the gold stars?

1089
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:37,470
The kids stopped drawing.

1090
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:40,350
This is incredibly often cited
in incredibly interesting

1091
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:44,910
debates about whether children
in impoverished schools should

1092
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:48,710
be given cash rewards
for studying hard.

1093
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:50,630
There's lots of debates about
whether that's a good thing or

1094
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,420
not a good thing, an effective
thing or not

1095
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,560
an effective thing.

1096
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,640
This study is often cited for
arguing, if you make something

1097
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,330
that you should love, like
learning, purely rewarded, the

1098
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:04,250
minute the reward stops, it
becomes a complete chore.

1099
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,750
But we don't know how
that applies.

1100
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,710
Because we might read
about things like

1101
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:10,970
baseball player salaries.

1102
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:12,810
And it seems like there's a
pretty good relationship

1103
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:14,860
between performance
and salary.

1104
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:18,490
So it's not simply that
way in the world.

1105
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:21,240
We know that often rewards
are associated with high

1106
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,000
performance and promote
high performance.

1107
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,810
It's pretty complicated.

1108
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:29,050
The last slide is about a
fantastic debate that occurred

1109
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:32,140
here in many ways between B.F.
Skinner at Harvard and Noam

1110
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:36,970
Chomsky at MIT, which is, in
what sense is language learned

1111
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:39,060
by conditioning?

1112
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:41,290
So here's an example
against it.

1113
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:45,330
At one month, there's a switch
inside a rubber nipple hooked

1114
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:46,690
to a tape recorder.

1115
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:48,410
And when the baby sucked,
the tape plays.

1116
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:51,980
This allows the baby to
perform, to behave.

1117
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:55,480
And they would play syllables
from different languages.

1118
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:59,950
And they may or may not be
in their own languages.

1119
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:04,680
And by four days, babies
preferred the languages that

1120
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,670
they are exposed to.

1121
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:11,970
And one of the questions is,
people said, well, how do we

1122
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:13,980
get kids to learn language
from a behaviorist

1123
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:14,580
perspective?

1124
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:18,700
So one of the things that they
studied children, and they'll

1125
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,480
often, young children will say
wrong things like mama isn't a

1126
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,290
boy, he a girl.

1127
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:24,140
That's not good grammar,
right?

1128
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:26,500
And so there was an intuition
that parents would then go,

1129
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,340
that's not good grammar.

1130
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:28,700
And sometimes parents do that.

1131
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,020
But when they did studies
where they recorded long

1132
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:33,260
sessions with parents
doing this, parents

1133
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,690
almost never corrected.

1134
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:37,540
It was very rare.

1135
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,220
You may feel different
from your own record.

1136
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:43,100
But statistically, it's
very rare to collect.

1137
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,680
They often say that's right
or something like that.

1138
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,920
So how's the child picking up
language if nobody's giving

1139
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,580
them rewards in terms
of whether

1140
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:52,970
they're right or wrong?

1141
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:55,540
The idea is that we can say an
infinite number of sentences.

1142
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:59,580
Well, how can we possibly be
rewarded or conditioned for an

1143
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,820
infinite variety of sentences?

1144
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:02,070
How could that work?

1145
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:04,360

1146
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,240
And finally, the phenomenon of
overgeneralizing, you may know

1147
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,680
that children will
overgeneralize things.

1148
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:14,700
Because we usually end E-D to
make a verb past tense, right?

1149
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:18,100

1150
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,360
But some verbs don't
work that way.

1151
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,110
So you would say, my teacher
held the rabbit.

1152
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:24,300
Children often make these
overgeneralized rules.

1153
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,560
They say, my teacher
holded the rabbit.

1154
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,740
So obviously, they're learning a
rule and then applying it to

1155
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:32,040
an instance that they
never hear.

1156
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,570
Because almost no
adult says that.

1157
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:36,520
So they must be producing that,
not on the basis of

1158
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:40,100
conditioning, but Chomsky argued
on the basis of sort of

1159
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:45,670
genetically prepotent ways in
which we learn language, rules

1160
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:47,660
that we develop and figure out
language in the world.

1161
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:50,500
I will say that, for those of
you happen to be interested in

1162
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:54,690
this topic, there's been a
striking pushback on that in

1163
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:57,460
what people call statistical
learning.

1164
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:02,770
So as much as this seemed like
a done deal 10 years ago, it

1165
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:05,290
turns out the truth might be
somewhere in the middle with

1166
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:08,480
some genetic prepotentiziation
but also a lot of learning

1167
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,430
from your environment both.

1168
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:15,940
So you can think, as you leave
here, what are the applause

1169
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,150
that you listen to?

1170
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,880
Where's your free will and your
choice of what goals you

1171
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,690
pursue and what matters
to you?

1172
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:25,370
And how does the world attempt
to teach you things that you

1173
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:27,050
learn about what you
want to do and why

1174
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:28,300
you want to do them?

1175
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:42,112
