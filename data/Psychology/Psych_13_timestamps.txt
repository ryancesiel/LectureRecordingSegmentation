00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:28,860

10
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,140
PROFESSOR: In a way, I would
say most of this course up

11
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,920
until today, or maybe the memory
lecture, was about how

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,310
brilliant the human
mind and brain is.

13
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,520
How the visual system is so
brilliant nobody can make a

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,910
machine that sees so well.

15
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,260
We didn't talk too much
about physical action.

16
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,820
But how we move in the world,
how we act upon the world,

17
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,320
there's no robot that can
compete with you.

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,260
Language is far beyond computers
to be nearly as

19
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,410
sophisticated as you are,
as a five-year-old is.

20
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,400
So in all those domains, we
mostly think about in terms of

21
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,280
psychology or brain function,
how is it that we're endowed

22
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,680
with such amazing capacities?

23
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,760
When it comes to thinking, one
of the highest forms of human

24
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,200
activity, thinking, hard problem
solving, edges of

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,120
creativity, that kinds of thing,
it's something we have

26
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,690
a huge respect for, something we
wish for, something that we

27
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,990
know is a very, very
valuable tool.

28
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,650
But psychologists have
emphasized the

29
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,400
traps we can fall in.

30
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,510
I mean in a way what's easy
for us is what the brain

31
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,010
empowers in us.

32
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,410
It's easy for us to recognize
objects or faces

33
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,580
or move in the world.

34
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,270
When we feel something is hard,
like thinking hard, for

35
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,840
problem sets or global warming
or other things that are hard

36
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,960
to think about, then we know
that we're sort of leaving the

37
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,830
apparatus that's easy for us
and we're entering into a

38
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:51,980
hazardous, difficult form
of our mental lives.

39
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,520
So, I'm going to show you
a video for a moment.

40
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,840
Because the other fun thing is,
and maybe this is true of

41
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,430
all of us in different ways, all
the time, we often don't

42
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,040
recognize, we often don't
recognize when we're thinking

43
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,000
not as well as we might.

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,080
So this is a trap.

45
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,590
So I'm going to show you, the
original punking TV show, this

46
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,540
was called Candid Camera.

47
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,170
It's pretty old.

48
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,535
So this is a clip from there.

49
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:19,090
And here's a couple people asked
to do a school problem,

50
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,350
7/8 divided by 3/4 and
how many square

51
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,840
feet in a square yard?

52
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,940
And what's kind of funny about
it in my mind is, not only

53
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,120
that the people are wrong, but
how wrong they are and how

54
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,539
much they don't realize
sometimes how wrong they are.

55
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:40,250

56
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:46,040
I mean what's impressive about
this is that not only are the

57
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,580
people wrong, but they don't
say like, I forget.

58
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,740
They just start to give answers,
throwing out numbers.

59
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,970
And so how different are
all of us in that?

60
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,800
So some of these again
are on the internet.

61
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,540
And this is an MIT audience,
which is about the hardest

62
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,530
audience to pull this off.

63
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,430
And at Stanford, I could pull
this off much better.

64
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,440
So some of these won't go as
easily as they might for other

65
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,240
typical audiences.

66
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,210
Here we go.

67
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,110
Two train stations are a
hundred miles apart.

68
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,130
At 2:00 PM one Saturday
afternoon, the two trains

69
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,900
start toward each other,
one from each station.

70
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,366
One travels at 60 miles
an hour, the other

71
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:19,080
at 40 miles an hour.

72
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,920
Just as the trains pulls out
of their stations, a bird

73
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,260
springs into the air in front of
the first train, and flies

74
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,480
ahead to the front
of the second.

75
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,530
When the bird reaches the
second, it turns back, without

76
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,180
losing any speed, and
flies directly

77
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:28,970
toward the first step.

78
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,630
Doesn't this remind you of all
the high school physics

79
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,120
problems you had earlier?

80
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,710
Where's the frictionless
pulley?

81
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,720
The bird continues to fly back
and forth between the trains

82
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,730
at 80 miles an hour.

83
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,210
How many miles will the
bird have flown

84
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:41,000
before the trains meet?

85
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,230
It's a little bit of a trick.

86
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:47,000
Because the answer is told to
you directly, pretty much.

87
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,450
So 100 miles apart.

88
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,635
How long will it take for the
trains to reach each other, if

89
00:03:51,635 --> 00:03:54,630
one is 60 miles an hour and
one is 40 miles an hour?

90
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,130
AUDIENCE: Hour.

91
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,720
PROFESSOR: Hour.

92
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,220
So how many miles an hour
does the bird fly?

93
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,250
AUDIENCE: 80.

94
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,500
Easier than you think.

95
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,280

96
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,020
So those are the kinds of ones I
just showed that people kind

97
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,750
of get themselves into
their thinking cap.

98
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,130
And it's a trick.

99
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,900
Here we go.

100
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,010
I need somebody who is willing
to, at their chair,

101
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,260
just call out words.

102
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:22,120

103
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,410
Thank you very much.

104
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:23,990
Here we go.

105
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,440
In English, many words are
pronounced somewhat

106
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,170
differently depending on the
way they are spelled.

107
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,330
But here we go.

108
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,270
Can you give me a synonym for
people or family, a word that

109
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,630
people would often
say for that?

110
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,410
I'll give you one.

111
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,590
Folk.

112
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,810
Now, I know this is
a history quiz.

113
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,020
But I'll help you.

114
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,000
I wouldn't know the answer
to this, necessarily.

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,940
Can you give me the name of an
American president at the time

116
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,690
of the Mexican War?

117
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,240
And I'll give you a hint.

118
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,595
It rhymes with folk.

119
00:04:48,595 --> 00:04:49,240
AUDIENCE: Polk.

120
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:49,940
PROFESSOR: Polk.

121
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,020
Everybody can help.

122
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,650
Everybody help.

123
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,330
One, two, three.

124
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,620
Can you give me the name of the
word that means egg white?

125
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,564
AUDIENCE: Yolk.

126
00:04:56,564 --> 00:04:58,520
PROFESSOR: Aha.

127
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:58,960
No.

128
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,380
Is the yolk, the egg white?

129
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,050

130
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:03,530
I know.

131
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,580
It's a pretty hilarious course.

132
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,240
Thank you.

133
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,690
So this is an example
of what people

134
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,880
call functional fixedness.

135
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,990
Your mind is going
a certain way.

136
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,470
And you're on a certain pace.

137
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,280
And all of a sudden when you
need to put the mental break

138
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,710
on, your habit of thought takes
you a slightly wrong

139
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,190
direction, on a very
superficial test.

140
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,110
Thank you very much.

141
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,330
Here's an experiment.

142
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,470
In 10 minutes, only about 39%
of people solve this.

143
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,020
You go into a room like this.

144
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,470
The strings are too far apart.

145
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,810
You have stuff around here.

146
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,670
And your job to tie the
strings together.

147
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,920
What do you do?

148
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,870

149
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,750
AUDIENCE: Stand on the chair?

150
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,620
PROFESSOR: Standing on the chair
is an interesting one.

151
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,830
Let's pretend it doesn't work.

152
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,770
It wouldn't.

153
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,020
It would get you up, but they'd
be far apart still.

154
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:50,660
It could.

155
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,400
Let's pretend it doesn't.

156
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,660
You'd have to be there,
to be convinced.

157
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:54,930
You know what I mean.

158
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,180
It mean depends on the angle.

159
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,610

160
00:05:58,610 --> 00:05:59,790
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

161
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,115
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

162
00:06:00,115 --> 00:06:01,340
AUDIENCE: Tie it to the end.

163
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,930
PROFESSOR: Ah.

164
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,490
So you're one of the 39%.

165
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,850
So the idea is, if you tie for
example, the pliers onto the

166
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:12,680
thing and get it swinging, you
could catch it, right?

167
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,770
So why don't people come up with
that answer very easily?

168
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:21,390
PROFESSOR: Because what
are pliers for?

169
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,180
Pliering.

170
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,840
They're not for swinging
ropes.

171
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,820
So again, the word they use
is functional fixedness.

172
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,680
You know what a plier is for.

173
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,390
It doesn't seem like a good
candidate to do this job.

174
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:35,830
Here's another one.

175
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,270
You walk into a room and there's
a door that's closed

176
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,180
behind you.

177
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,430
And you see these things
on a table.

178
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,310
And you're asked, could
you support this

179
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,290
candle on the door?

180
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:49,780
About 23% of people
get this, in 1945.

181
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,590
What do you do?

182
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,220
This is just like all
the spy movies.

183
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,944
Yes?

184
00:06:55,944 --> 00:06:57,194
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

185
00:06:57,194 --> 00:06:59,450

186
00:06:59,450 --> 00:06:59,875
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

187
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,515
AUDIENCE: Put the tacks through
the width of the door.

188
00:07:01,515 --> 00:07:02,570
PROFESSOR: Yeah, through
the width of door

189
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,790
would be pretty good.

190
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,380
It's not really supporting
the candle, but it

191
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,230
could get the job done.

192
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,130
That's not a bad thought.

193
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,350
These are all good thoughts.

194
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,090
If it were me, I wouldn't
be close.

195
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,300
So that's better than I do.

196
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:11,980
Yeah?

197
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,740
AUDIENCE: Take out the tacks
and then tack the base.

198
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,300
PROFESSOR: Have you
see this before?

199
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:16,690
No.

200
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:17,410
Excellent.

201
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:21,060
As I tell you, MIT's audience
is not an easy audience.

202
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,230
The idea is that you dump the
tacks, and then stick the tack

203
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,900
into the back of
the empty box.

204
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,820
Nice platform for a candle.

205
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,520
Why don't most people
think about that?

206
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,650
Because what's the
job of the box?

207
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,060
To hold the tacks.

208
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,610
My job is to figure
out this problem.

209
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,820
You hang on to the tacks.

210
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,330
And in fact if they do the same
experiment, but just put

211
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:48,070
the tacks next to the
box, a lot of people

212
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,350
get it right away.

213
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,650
Because now that box, it's
yearning to support something.

214
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:53,570
It no longer has a job.

215
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,360
It's an unemployed box that you
can stick onto the door

216
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,530
and support this.

217
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:01,140
Your mind just gets stuck with
thinking the box is a holder.

218
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,390
It's not a platform.

219
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,870

220
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,810
This is the original-- and
you've seen this so

221
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:07,370
many times by now.

222
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,860
This is one of the original,
thinking outside of the box

223
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,500
things, where you're supposed to
connect the dots with four

224
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,065
straight lines without
lifting a pencil.

225
00:08:14,065 --> 00:08:21,440

226
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,140
Some of you know this.

227
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,430
Some of you are figuring
out on the spot.

228
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,830
But I'll just show you.

229
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,155
So there's an answer.

230
00:08:28,155 --> 00:08:30,840
The other ones are similar.

231
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,140
Why do so many people
get stuck in this

232
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,600
and not get it done?

233
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,980
Because they don't
like this part.

234
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,760
And they don't like this
part, because it's

235
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,520
drawing outside the box.

236
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,350
They're always looking for the
connections within the box.

237
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,870
And it seems cheating in some
sense to draw outside the box.

238
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,740
There's an intuition, like with
the box with the tacks,

239
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,610
that you're supposed
to stay in there.

240
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:54,450
So if they get no information
in this study, practically

241
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,140
nobody solved it,
in a given time.

242
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,830
If they get a hint, you
can draw outside the

243
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,470
square, that helps.

244
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,080
But then, outside the square
puts again, the first line.

245
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,280
They're still only half
the time getting it.

246
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,740
Because you've got to go
outside a second time.

247
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,420
So it gets a lot of information
to get comfortable

248
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,470
with finding a way to do this
that's completely within the

249
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,410
rules, but not the way you
intuitively feel might be the

250
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,840
right way to do it.

251
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,170
So those are all examples of
functional fixedness, where

252
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,620
you have a certain belief about
what's going on and it's

253
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,670
hard to overcome that to solve
a problem in a novel way.

254
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,950
Another thing that people think
about as the way to

255
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,130
overcome some of these problems
of thinking about

256
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:36,790
problems is different
representations that let you

257
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,850
take a different look at
a problem to be solved.

258
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,700
So picture a large
piece of paper, a

259
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,050
hundredth of an inch thick.

260
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,690
Now, in your imagination,
fold it once.

261
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:44,770
You have two layers.

262
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,620
Continue to fold it on
itself 50 times.

263
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,120
It's true that's it's impossible
to fold it in

264
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,270
place, such a piece of
paper, 50 times.

265
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,350
But for the sake of the problem,
imagining that you

266
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,712
can, about how thick would the
50-times-folded paper be?

267
00:09:55,712 --> 00:09:57,640
And everybody's first intuition
is, well, how thick

268
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,430
can a piece of paper be?

269
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,370
Of course, this is a
hypothetical problem, not an

270
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,130
actual paper problem.

271
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,660
But if you do the
math, it's big.

272
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:08,800

273
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,150
So here's another one.

274
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:14,160

275
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,620
One morning, exactly at sunrise,
a Buddhist monk began

276
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,980
to climb a tall mountain.

277
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,075
A narrow path no more than a
foot or two wide, spiraled

278
00:10:20,075 --> 00:10:21,430
around the mountain
to a glittering

279
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:22,520
temple at the summit.

280
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,690
The monk ascended at various
rates of speed, stopping many

281
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,240
times along the way to rest
and eat dried fruit he

282
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,710
carried with him.

283
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,370
He reached the temple shortly
before sunset.

284
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,350
After several days of fasting
and meditation, he began his

285
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,920
journey back along the same
path, starting it at sunrise

286
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,630
and again walking at variable
speeds, with many

287
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,910
pauses along the way.

288
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,710
His average speed descending
was, of course, greater than

289
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,280
his average climbing speed.

290
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,700
Show that there's a spot along
the path that the monk will

291
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,320
occupy on both trips
at precisely the

292
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,020
same time of day.

293
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,050
So that sounds moderately
hard.

294
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,610
But if you draw the
picture, so we

295
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:51,630
went and get an equation.

296
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,860
Now, we have a pictorial
representation.

297
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:57,010
You can see there has to be some
moment of the ascending

298
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,450
and descending path that
cross in time.

299
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,820
You don't know what
it's going to be.

300
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,600
But there has to be some
moment in time.

301
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,700
And maybe that's obvious.

302
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,840
But for a lot of people it seems
stunningly complicated

303
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,025
that you could even
demonstrate that

304
00:11:07,025 --> 00:11:09,040
in any way at all.

305
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,880
Here's one you could
think about.

306
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,620
Suppose you are a doctor faced
with a patient who has a

307
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,190
malignant tumor in
his stomach.

308
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,340
It's impossible to operate on
the tumor, but unless the

309
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,440
tumor is destroyed the
patient will die.

310
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,660
There's a kind of ray that can
be used to destroy the tumor.

311
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,860
If the rays reach the tumor all
at once, with sufficiently

312
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,680
high intensity, the tumor
will be destroyed.

313
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,350
Unfortunately, at this high
intensity the healthy tissue

314
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,240
that the rays pass through,
will also be destroyed.

315
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,860
At lower intensity, the rays
are harmless to healthy

316
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,570
tissue, but they don't affect
the tumor either.

317
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,860
What type of procedure might be
used to destroy the tumor

318
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,910
with the rays, and at the same
time avoid destroying the

319
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,820
healthy tissue?

320
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,050
Now, if you know the answer to
this, don't jump right up.

321
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,820
Give other people a few
moments to puzzle.

322
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:53,370

323
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:57,760
About 10% of people solve this
in a small unit of time,

324
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,010
before the Internet.

325
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,800

326
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,180
And so, what's the answer
though, for those of you?

327
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,950
Yeah, I see some
hands, I think.

328
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:08,270
Go ahead.

329
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,920
Did you want to say?

330
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

331
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:10,530
PROFESSOR: No.

332
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,385
Exactly at the spot, sir.

333
00:12:11,385 --> 00:12:12,780
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

334
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,430
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

335
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:17,350
Have several weak ones aimed
to converge at the tumor.

336
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,290
I saw your hands.

337
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,170
So the idea is to have several
different rays, each of which

338
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,740
are weak enough not to
destroy the tissue.

339
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,930
But when they converge spatially
at the tumor, they

340
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,400
would sum enough to
destroy the tumor.

341
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,840
That's the problem-solving
answer to this.

342
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,990
So knowing that, here's another
kind of a problem.

343
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,390
A dictator ruled a small country
from a fortress.

344
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,750
The fortress was situated in the
middle of the country and

345
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,420
many roads radiated
outward from it,

346
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,670
like spokes in a wheel.

347
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,740
A great general vowed to capture
the fortress and free

348
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,080
the country of the dictator.

349
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,810
The general knew that if the
entire army could attack the

350
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,320
fortress at once, it
could be captured.

351
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,300
But a spy reported that the
dictator had planted mines on

352
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,380
each of the roads.

353
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,630
The mines were set so that small
bodies of men could pass

354
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:58,180
over them safely, since dictator
needed to be able to

355
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,000
move troops and workers about.

356
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,610
However, any large force would
detonate the mines.

357
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,320
Not only would this blow up
the road, but the dictator

358
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,860
would destroy many villages
in retaliation.

359
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,050
A full-scale, direct attack
on the fortress seemed

360
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,250
impossible.

361
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,270
Does this problem remind you of
the other problem, I mean

362
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,190
back-to-back, like this?

363
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,130
He divided his army up
into small groups.

364
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,520
Now, they're small enough per
path into the castle.

365
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,320
And they converge on the
castle, like the X-rays

366
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,260
converged on the tumor.

367
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,000
So this is reasoning
by analogy.

368
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,170
We have problem solving
approach.

369
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,000
Divide your resources
spatially.

370
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,270
Have them meet at the same time,
and converge in a way

371
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,310
that's effective.

372
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,750
So what you might call the deep
structure of the problem

373
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,760
is the same, with the surface
story being different.

374
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,280
One is tumors and treatments.

375
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,690
But there's a strict analogy.

376
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,400
Capturing the castle is like
destroying the tumor.

377
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,290
The fortress is like the tumor
that you want to get to.

378
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,710
The army is like the
rays and the

379
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,250
general is like the doctor.

380
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,650
So if it is back-to-back like
this, where I just said,

381
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,280
here's a problem.

382
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,430
And here's a problem
just like that.

383
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:01,300
Everybody says, well, send the
troops on the different paths

384
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,660
and have them converge
at the same time.

385
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,590
If you don't say that though, if
you don't tell people this

386
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,010
is the same, use
the same rule.

387
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:11,160
If you don't tell people that,
only about a third come up

388
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,460
with it spontaneously.

389
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,920
If you just make a little bit
of an effort not to make it

390
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,610
completely obvious that
it's the same problem.

391
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:18,860
You just wait a little bit.

392
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,990

393
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:25,030
So the surface differences,
the war story versus the

394
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:29,120
medical story, will mostly throw
people from recognizing

395
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,220
the analogies.

396
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:33,320
People recognize surface
analogies all the time.

397
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,690
If we have war in the Middle
East now, from the US

398
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:40,240
perspective there's analogies
to Vietnam, a war and a war.

399
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,540
But other kinds of analogies
across situations, people have

400
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,740
a hard time mapping, if the
surfaces look different.

401
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,140
And here's an example where they
gave people two problems

402
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,410
of a certain kind.

403
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,720
And they said as part of the
experiment, and here's a

404
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,800
classroom demonstration.

405
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,620
If it's immediate, they
sort of get it.

406
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:03,390
But if they wait just a little
bit, and they move from one

407
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:07,640
room to another room, they don't
apply the rule at all.

408
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,230
So it's very tricky.

409
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,970
We would like to think well,
gee, we know all kinds of

410
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,040
things about the world, that
we can bring in a mental

411
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,380
toolkit to solve problems,
all kinds of ideas.

412
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,690
But if the problem doesn't look
the same as the prior

413
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:22,070
problem, people have a hard
time spontaneously saying,

414
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,900
there's an answer I know, and
I can apply it to the

415
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,520
situation, unless it's really,
really obvious.

416
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,230
People don't transfer deep
solutions very easily across

417
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,480
what looks like different
situations.

418
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,150

419
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,020
Something different.

420
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,530
The instructors in a flight
school adopted a policy of

421
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,990
consistent, positive
reinforcement, recommended by

422
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,780
psychologists.

423
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,150
And we know we're very
suspicious about

424
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,320
psychologists, right?

425
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,580
But you have to imagine the
instructor went to some

426
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,350
classroom and somebody said,
positive reinforcement

427
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,800
is the way to go.

428
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,480
They verbally reinforced each
successful execution of a

429
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,820
flight maneuver.

430
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,710
After some experience with this
training approach, the

431
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:59,020
instructors claimed that
contrary to psychological

432
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:03,980
doctrine, high praise for good
execution of complex maneuvers

433
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,480
typically result in a decrement
of performance on

434
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,880
the next try.

435
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,920
Are they correct?

436
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,360
So you understand, you have to
have in your mind all the

437
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,550
military movies where
there's a really

438
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,140
tough sergeant training.

439
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,860
The other one that yells at
you to make you succeed.

440
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,830
But for half the movie, you
don't know if the sergeant

441
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,770
will break you or make you
into a better woman or a

442
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,000
better man.

443
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,970
So he's barking orders.

444
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,940
And some psychologist says,
well, you should really think

445
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,520
about saying nice things to
these people, because that's

446
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,150
encouraging.

447
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,760
Errgh.

448
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,820
Somebody does a flight
maneuver and does

449
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,427
a really good job.

450
00:16:32,427 --> 00:16:33,870
And he goes, that's awesome.

451
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,400
And then the person goes
up and does worse.

452
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,990
And he goes aargh, you're
all terrible.

453
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,170
So what's happening?

454
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,420
Yeah.

455
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:49,470

456
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:53,110
AUDIENCE: It must-- the person
typically does really well.

457
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:56,470
Doing really well one time isn't
indicative of really

458
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:56,950
well the next time.

459
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,100
PROFESSOR: It's even worse
than that, right.

460
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,040
So all of us have in us a
range of performance.

461
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,660
We know that.

462
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:05,430
If you do sports, if you do
research, if you do anything,

463
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,680
some days we're at
our average.

464
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,920
Some days, we're not so good.

465
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,480
Some days, we go wow, that
was pretty good.

466
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,910
We all have a range of
performance that's possible,

467
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,970
our average performance, our
best days, our worst days.

468
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,700
So you just went up
and you did an

469
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,700
awesome flight maneuver.

470
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,919
Is that your average one or
is that a peak example?

471
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:28,530

472
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,330
It's a peak example.

473
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,070
Statistically, what's the
likelihood of your next one

474
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:35,020
going to be, better or worse?

475
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,270
Worse.

476
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,210

477
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,930
You can't always be at your
best, because you'd sort of go

478
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:43,440
into infinite excellence.

479
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,840
You have a range
of performance.

480
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,500

481
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,800
In the NBA, what's a
really good score?

482
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,090
30 points is really good.

483
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,700
That's the average though,
of the best players.

484
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,530
They don't go out and go,
I got 30 tonight.

485
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:56,600
And tomorrow, I'll get 32.

486
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,770
And by the end of the season,
I have like 180

487
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,320
points every game.

488
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,690
Even if you're on the
Miami Heat, you have

489
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,190
to do a good job.

490
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:08,800
So do you understand?

491
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,920
So here's another example.

492
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,340
Parents of very famous,
successful kids, are they

493
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,680
mostly super-famous and
super-successful?

494
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,800
Or do we mostly read about them
and go whoa, that's a

495
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,050
tough deal, what
happened there?

496
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,365
What's your impression?

497
00:18:23,365 --> 00:18:27,200

498
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,630
Let's ask this question--

499
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,950
and if you are facing
these burdens.

500
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:34,155
If your parent wins a Nobel
Prize, what's the odds that

501
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:36,450
you win a Nobel Prize.

502
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:36,785
Small.

503
00:18:36,785 --> 00:18:39,530
And they go oh, the
underachieving kid.

504
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:42,110
All the pressure from the parent
to do really well, with

505
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,710
a Nobel Laureate
as your parent.

506
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,960
Well, maybe.

507
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,360
Maybe your parent is berating
from kindergarten on saying,

508
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,820
if you don't eat your peas and
carrots, you won't win a Nobel

509
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,380
Prize, like I. That's
a possibility.

510
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,180
We can't rule it out.

511
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,490
But if somebody in your family
wins a Nobel Prize, what's the

512
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:58,630
odds that other people in your
family will win that.

513
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:58,950
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

514
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,320
So we call that regression
to the mean.

515
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,380
If you have an outstanding
example, a person who wins a

516
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:09,210
Nobel Prize, everybody around
them is not likely to win.

517
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:12,870
If you have an outstanding day
at what you do, like a really

518
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:17,120
good day, the next day is
likely to be worse, just

519
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,080
statistically.

520
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,000
So what's happening with
this flight instructor?

521
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,160
This is a very powerful and
important idea, that

522
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,830
intuitively often, what's
happening with the flight

523
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,440
instructor?

524
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,050
Of course if the guy does
awesome, he's going to do

525
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:30,700
worse the next time, every
single time, practically,

526
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,620
statistically.

527
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:35,200
So we can think about this,
regression to the mean.

528
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,770
Here's a standard

529
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,640
distribution, bell-shaped curve.

530
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,560
Here's the mean of whatever
you do, how well you shoot

531
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,785
baskets, how well you study for
a test, how well you wrote

532
00:19:41,785 --> 00:19:45,680
a paper, how well you helped a
friend who needed consoling.

533
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,930
You pick your thing.

534
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,610
Some days you do a medium job.

535
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:50,540
You're average.

536
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:54,150
Some days you really impress
yourself with how you did.

537
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,270
And some days, you're pretty
shocked at what a miserable

538
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,630
day you had.

539
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,710
Does that makes sense?

540
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,230
So if you had an awesome outing,
by average, the next

541
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:06,220
outing is going to be less good,
regression to the mean.

542
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,790

543
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,570
So one place that this has been
done over and over and

544
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,290
over again, and somebody
help me out here.

545
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,570
This could happen
in any sport.

546
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:19,270
But especially in basketball,
people talk about a hot hand.

547
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,050
So some of you are sports
enthusiasts.

548
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,130
Probably some of you are not.

549
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:25,250
So a sports enthusiast, will
you please help me describe

550
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:30,410
what a hot hand is
in basketball?

551
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,320
Help the rest of the class.

552
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:31,812
Oh, thanks.

553
00:20:31,812 --> 00:20:34,887
AUDIENCE: You think you're on a
hot streak just because you

554
00:20:34,887 --> 00:20:36,240
made a couple baskets in row.

555
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,536
But they do the statistics and
then it ends up being that

556
00:20:38,536 --> 00:20:41,652
they're just overconfident in
their shots, since they are

557
00:20:41,652 --> 00:20:45,550
shooting more shots
in the end.

558
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:45,641
PROFESSOR: So people
have a saying --

559
00:20:45,641 --> 00:20:47,920
If you watch a basketball game,
it's incredibly how

560
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,790
often the announcer will
say, oh, player x, he

561
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,370
or she is on a tear.

562
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:54,350
They're so hot.

563
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,570
Pass that ball to that person.

564
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,600
They're so hot.

565
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,510
They shoot a three-pointer.

566
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,540
And they come down and they
shoot a three-pointer.

567
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,970
And they say, why are
you passing the

568
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:00,620
ball to that person?

569
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,100
They're so hot.

570
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,610
And some players are known as
streaky players, who go out

571
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:09,160
and have just awesome nights.

572
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,650
You hear this in the sports
all the time.

573
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,790
I can't tell you, the end of
a close March Madness game,

574
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,400
they're always saying,
pass it to this guy.

575
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,580
Because this guy is on a
streak in this game.

576
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,180

577
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,550
So they can do the statistics.

578
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,020
How would you do the
statistic to know

579
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,700
whether streaks actually--

580
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,170
streaks exist.

581
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,610
Sometimes you do two baskets
in a row or five.

582
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:30,870
Or you miss five in a row.

583
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:33,520
There are runs, like
heads and tails.

584
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,380
But the question we're asking
is, if you made a shot, does

585
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,460
that an increase in any short
run, the probability that

586
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,870
you'll make the next shot?

587
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:41,660
That would be the streak.

588
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,780
That would be the hot shooter.

589
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,180
So you can go do statistics.

590
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:44,930
And they did it.

591
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,540
Psychologists have done it on
many teams, in many leagues.

592
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,440
They did every single shot of a
Cornell basketball team, the

593
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,070
entire season.

594
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,500
But they've done it on
many other teams.

595
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,670
There is no such thing
as a hot streak.

596
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:55,920
There is no such thing
as a hot streak.

597
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,090
Of course, you have small runs,
where people have a lot

598
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,500
of good shots.

599
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,280
Another day, they'll have
a lot of bad shots.

600
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,740
But the probability of making
any one shot is no higher or

601
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,140
lower, given the probability
that you made the prior shot.

602
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,850
They're completely
independent.

603
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:11,430
And nobody can find statistical
support for any

604
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,900
kind of streaks in sports,
except of course you have huge

605
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,420
distributions.

606
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,910
So sometimes a person
will have an

607
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,775
exceptionally good or bad night.

608
00:22:17,775 --> 00:22:20,570

609
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:21,910
So this is kind of like that.

610
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,140
And you will get this.

611
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,290
Suppose that you have a normal
penny with a head and a tail.

612
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:26,130
You toss it six times.

613
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,460
Which is these outcomes
is most likely?

614
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,860

615
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,690
All the same.

616
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,350
You're absolutely right.

617
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:42,980
But why do people tend not to
like a), mostly, who haven't

618
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,280
studied probability much?

619
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:45,950
They don't like a).

620
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,200
Why don't they like a)?

621
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,400

622
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,500
Most people, most of the time,
as a random thing?

623
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:52,980
Yeah?

624
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,960
AUDIENCE: It doesn't
look random.

625
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,360
PROFESSOR: It doesn't
look random, man.

626
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,540
A) can't be random, right?

627
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,610
But we know that we have
short runs of anything.

628
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:01,010
And each of these are
independent outcomes.

629
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,260
That's exactly what you got.

630
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,690

631
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:05,850
We did this example before.

632
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,650
But there are 30 people
in the group.

633
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,470
You get the month and date of
each person's birthday.

634
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,330
What is the approximate
probability that two people

635
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,670
have the exact same birthday?

636
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:15,490
And most people will say, oh, I
haven't met that many people

637
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:16,020
on my birthday.

638
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,090
Not that high.

639
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:19,290
But it's actually 70%.

640
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:20,420
Because it's any two
in the group.

641
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,580
It's not you.

642
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,650
It's any two in the group.

643
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:26,080
And that increases it to 70%.

644
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,010
Here's one we haven't done.

645
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,997
Imagine a college in which the
average height of men is 175

646
00:23:28,997 --> 00:23:30,040
centimeters.

647
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,980
You randomly measure the
height of three men.

648
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,620
Which of these two outcomes
is more likely?

649
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,540
And I'll let you think about
this for a moment.

650
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:40,610
John at 178, Mike at 170, and
Bob at 176; or John at 177,

651
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:43,400
Mike at 177, and Bob at 177?

652
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,174
Which is more likely,
or can't tell?

653
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,424
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

654
00:23:47,424 --> 00:23:52,820

655
00:23:52,820 --> 00:24:01,510
PROFESSOR: I heard a
B. Is it obvious?

656
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,045
Let me tell you.

657
00:24:02,045 --> 00:24:04,160
It's the same concept we've
been talking about, about

658
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,810
distributions and means.

659
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:10,610
So here's the average, which
you are given as 175.

660
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:14,000
So these guys are closer
to the average.

661
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,550
Height is distributed
in a normalized way.

662
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:21,320
So here's the three people, who
are red dots, the equal

663
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,680
heights, 177, and
177, and 177.

664
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,150
Here are the heights
of the blue.

665
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,940
There's more people in this
part of the distribution.

666
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:30,100
So it's actually more likely to
get this than this, about

667
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,480
40% more likely.

668
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,140
Because you're sampling from
closer to the mean.

669
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,820
And there are more people
near the mean.

670
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,420
Does that make sense?

671
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,530
But people don't like that.

672
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:42,380
Overwhelmingly, if you ask
people, they like the top

673
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,160
answer, because it just doesn't
feel right to get

674
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,430
three people of equal height,
in a random way.

675
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:51,990
And you could say, what do you
mean it doesn't feel right?

676
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,490
We can do the math or we can
show you the picture.

677
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:57,390
And we can all agree, I think,
that that's correct.

678
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,660
What do you mean it doesn't
feel right?

679
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,540
And that's what people mean
by the difference between

680
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,220
algorithms and heuristics.

681
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,230
This is work from Kahneman and
Tversky, that won a Noble

682
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,410
Prize for Danny Kahneman.

683
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,690
Tversky passed away.

684
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:11,370
Which is that humans could
figure out many things

685
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,330
algorithmically.

686
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:14,060
You can do the probability.

687
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,440
But as an intuition, for many,
many, many people, even

688
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,280
educated people who know a
lot about probability.

689
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,590
There's an intuition that we
have about things, heuristics,

690
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,700
a feeling we have
about things.

691
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:28,370
Like the odds of this
are almost nil.

692
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,590
And we go by that feeling,
instead of by being the

693
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:36,790
rational analyst that
we might be.

694
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,160
Here's one.

695
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,240
You'll get this one, I think.

696
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,220
A nearby town is served
by two hospitals.

697
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,910
About 45 babies are born each
day in the larger, about 15 in

698
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:43,910
the smaller.

699
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,010
Approximately half of
the babies are boys.

700
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:47,600
However, the exact percentage
varies day to

701
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,610
day, of boys and girls.

702
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:50,120
Some days, it's higher
than 50%.

703
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,350
Some days, lower.

704
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,490
For a period of a year, both
the larger and the smaller

705
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:56,350
hospital recorded the number of
days in which more than 60%

706
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,850
of the babies were boys.

707
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,860
So a disproportionate
number were boys.

708
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,870
Which hospital do you think
recorded more such days?

709
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:10,360

710
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:16,090
The answer is about the same.

711
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:18,040
The most common answer
is about the same.

712
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,003
But because of the law of small
numbers, you're going to

713
00:26:21,003 --> 00:26:23,115
get more weird samples in
the smaller hospital.

714
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:25,930

715
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:27,070
Because it'll be a less
of a distribution.

716
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,970
You'll get more weird stuff.

717
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:31,130
Here's one.

718
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:34,040
It's a little dated, in terms
of the language used.

719
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,460
But they would give people
an example of this.

720
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,860
Linda is a 31-year-old, single,

721
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,840
outspoken, very bright.

722
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,580
She majored in philosophy
as a student.

723
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,165
She was deeply concerned with
the issue of discrimination

724
00:26:41,165 --> 00:26:43,690
and social justice and also
participated in antinuclear

725
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:44,420
demonstrations.

726
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,690
And then rank the options in
terms of their likelihood.

727
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,840
In describing Linda, I'll give
a ranking of 1 to the most

728
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,660
likely option and a ranking of
8 to the least likely option.

729
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,350
So people go through this.

730
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,980
I mean you're sort of just
making up stuff.

731
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:58,090
Having said this, I think people
go around all the time

732
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:00,280
having impressions of people in
their head, what are they

733
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,930
really like, what are
they really about.

734
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,280
But they do this
kind of thing.

735
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,770
And here's the interesting
element to the result.

736
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:09,320
People on average, are more
likely to endorse the

737
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,990
statement, Linda is a bank
teller and active in the

738
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:15,060
feminist movement, than Linda
is a bank teller.

739
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:21,060
Now, why logically is that a bad
idea, as you're guessing

740
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,790
about Linda and what
you might do?

741
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:25,890
Why is it logically a bad idea
to pick h, more than f?

742
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:26,940
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

743
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,360
PROFESSOR: Right.

744
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:28,630
Yeah.

745
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:29,860
Yeah.

746
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:33,500
Just logically, heuristically,
algorithmically, right, sorry,

747
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,253
it's more likely you'd
be correct saying

748
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:35,430
she's a bank teller.

749
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,970
She's a bank teller and shes--

750
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:38,660
But why do you think more
people pick this one?

751
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:42,790

752
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,570
Because of your intuition.

753
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,000
So people think, well
this is a person who

754
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,330
might be like this?

755
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,310
So they go for the bigger
description.

756
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:51,020
And not just unsuspecting
undergraduates, but also

757
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,960
first-year grad students in
stats courses, and also

758
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,630
doctoral students in decision
science programs

759
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:55,840
and business school.

760
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,460
It's not, with more training
you can avert these errors.

761
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:04,060
But everybody has it in them
pretty easily to be seduced by

762
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,940
intuitive heuristics of
reasoning, rather than

763
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:10,380
algorithmic analyses.

764
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,560
Availability is kind of fun.

765
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,030
So this is a slow one.

766
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:15,930

767
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:18,460
This example is a little
work, for an example.

768
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,040
Some experts studied the
frequency of appearance of

769
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,440
various letters in the
English language.

770
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,360
They studied a typical passage
in English and recorded the

771
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,250
relative frequency with which
various letters of the

772
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,840
alphabet appeared in the
first and the third

773
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,400
positions of words.

774
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,840
For example, in the word
"language," appears "L"

775
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,990
appears in the first position
and "N" appears in the third.

776
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,530
In this study, words with
less than three

777
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:34,310
letters were not examined.

778
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,730
Consider the letter "K." Do you
think that the K is more

779
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:38,210
likely to appear in
the first position

780
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,480
or the third position?

781
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,310
Now estimate the ratio for the
number of times it appears in

782
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:45,490
the first versus the third.

783
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:49,010
So it could be even, 1:1; it
could be more often in the

784
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:51,840
third position, like 1:2; or it
could twice as often in the

785
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,160
first position.

786
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,410
Any feelings?

787
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:58,190

788
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:01,110
Just for fun, who thinks K
appears more often in the

789
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,700
first word than the third?

790
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:03,980
Just for fun.

791
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,080
Help me out here.

792
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,430
Hands up.

793
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,520
If you have to pick
one or the other.

794
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,180
You have to pick one
or the other.

795
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,920
How many people like in
the third position?

796
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,265
Anyway, so here's what
happens mostly.

797
00:29:14,265 --> 00:29:16,660
Not your estimate, but
the estimate of

798
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,950
students in larger samples.

799
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,090
2:1, they like K in the
first position.

800
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,140
It's really 1:2 in
the dictionary.

801
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,760
Why do you think on average,
people tend to go for K in the

802
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,220
first position?

803
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,710
So now we need somebody who's
willing to say something, give

804
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:30,740
some answers out there.

805
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,050
Yeah?

806
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:34,504
AUDIENCE: Because it's easier
to think of words that start

807
00:29:34,504 --> 00:29:35,380
with K than it is--

808
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,560
PROFESSOR: Yes.

809
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,250
So help me out.

810
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,040
Let's do this for one second.

811
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,540
Somebody call out a
K word, any word?

812
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,360
AUDIENCE: Knight.

813
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:41,820
PROFESSOR: Knight.

814
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,770
Another word?

815
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:43,570
AUDIENCE: Kind.

816
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:44,400
PROFESSOR: Kind.

817
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,000
Another word?

818
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,910
AUDIENCE: Kangaroo.

819
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,080
PROFESSOR: Kangaroo.

820
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,780
Excellent.

821
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,510
OK, very good.

822
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,305
OK, quick, a K in the
third position?

823
00:29:50,305 --> 00:29:51,460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

824
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,710
PROFESSOR: Oh, you guys are--

825
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:55,090

826
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:58,350
I should have done
it differently.

827
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:01,340
So now we're talking about the
heuristic of availability,

828
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:05,450
that we sort of think that how
common something is and then

829
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:08,650
in some ways, how important
something is, by the ease with

830
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:09,520
which it comes to mind.

831
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,510
It's easier really to think of
words beginning with K, then

832
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,100
having K in the third
position.

833
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,420
Here's a question.

834
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,720
How much more likely are you,
and I don't know the answer to

835
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,405
this, but you can figure it out,
to drown in the bathtub

836
00:30:20,405 --> 00:30:22,510
than to die from a terrorist
attack in the United States?

837
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:25,980
Obviously since 9/11, terrorism
has been a a huge

838
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,490
issue in our county,
a huge issue.

839
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:31,820
But in the US, what
do you think?

840
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:36,730
Much more likely for people to
die drowning in a bathtub than

841
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:39,880
terrorist attacks, including
9/11, for the 2000s.

842
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,600
So why is it, why is it that you
have constant discussion

843
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,990
about terrorism?

844
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:48,430
Why is it that you take off your
shoes and can't take much

845
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,220
of your toothpaste
on the airplane?

846
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:54,280
And yet nobody is talking to
you, saying, please exercise

847
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,580
caution when you go
into the bathroom.

848
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,930
And please have those things,
those sticky things that make

849
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,740
it less likely to slip.

850
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,540
Do you get much of that?

851
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:04,050
Do you go to the airport and
they say, those shoes look a

852
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:07,440
little slippery, in case
you go into a shower.

853
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,950
So think about this, which is
the real danger, just in a

854
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:13,500
practical way, and why do people
worry so much, and not

855
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,520
for bad reasons, about
terrorism?

856
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,830
What's the difference
between them?

857
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:21,410
And you can think of
more than one.

858
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:21,900
Yeah?

859
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,104
AUDIENCE: You hear about
terrorism on the news, but you

860
00:31:24,104 --> 00:31:25,830
don't hear about anyone drowning
in the bathtub.

861
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:26,280
PROFESSOR: That's huge.

862
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,930
Availability is huge.

863
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:31,400
The news is a very powerful way
in which we think that's

864
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,560
what the world is full of,
terrorism in the US.

865
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,770
We hear about terror groups that
are found, terror cells

866
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,750
that are found.

867
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:42,330
We'll hear about homicides a
little bit, in the local news.

868
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:44,370
But you just never hear about,
unless it unfortunately

869
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,600
happens to somebody you know
personally, somebody slipping

870
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,690
and dying in the bathtub.

871
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:48,730
And it does happen.

872
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:49,990
But you don't hear
about it much.

873
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:50,720
It's not available to you.

874
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,080
Yeah?

875
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,972
AUDIENCE: We're most scared of
things that are foreign to us

876
00:31:53,972 --> 00:31:54,936
even if they are
less dangerous.

877
00:31:54,936 --> 00:31:58,068
Like we'd be more likely to
drink a clear fluid that was

878
00:31:58,068 --> 00:32:00,250
more dangerous than something
that looks scary.

879
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,080
PROFESSOR: Part of it is, what
you're saying, there's a sense

880
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,420
of foreignness to the terrorism
that we don't

881
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:04,940
understand.

882
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,440
Maybe there's a sense
of passivity.

883
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,430
We feel like we could do
something about the bathroom.

884
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,470
We can't do something about
an airplane being

885
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,860
driven into a building.

886
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,960
These things are complicated.

887
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,450
But it's fascinating what people
think is scary versus

888
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:19,750
what by any rational analysis,
is dangerous.

889
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,480

890
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,640
Here's another kind of way that
people easily struggle

891
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,900
with numbers and thinking
about what's

892
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,030
dangerous and not.

893
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,100
So imagine you're a physician
and you're presented with this

894
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:31,380
information.

895
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,090
And let's hypothesize
that it's true.

896
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,230
Somebody comes in
with dizziness.

897
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,390
And they say, I'm worried
about a brain tumor.

898
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,700
They go to your neurologist.

899
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,630
And the neurologist says well,
here we have some statistics

900
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:43,360
over the last two years, whether
somebody turned out to

901
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,300
have a brain tumor or not,
present or absent; and whether

902
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,990
they were dizzy or not,
present or absent.

903
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:52,320
So you can make a 2 x 2 cell,
about they had a tumor and

904
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,040
they reported dizziness; they
reported dizziness, but it

905
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,280
turns out they had the
tumor; and so on.

906
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,330
So here's the question
for you.

907
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:03,760
Is being dizzy something
to worry about in

908
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,480
terms of having a tumor?

909
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,680
Should you be worried if you're
dizzy, that you might

910
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:11,870
have a brain tumor,
by these numbers?

911
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:14,020
So what do you think
most people think?

912
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,900
You have to make
a quick answer.

913
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,170
You're one of those doctors on
House, who's going to get

914
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:21,320
berated in a moment.

915
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:27,620
And you go, whoa, 160, bad.

916
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,240
That's what a lot
of people feel.

917
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,270
And by the way, there's a lot
of concern in medicine about

918
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:36,140
how doctors convey risk to
patients, as patients pick

919
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,740
what kind of treatment
they want.

920
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,510
Because it's exactly what
we're talking about now.

921
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:42,790
It's the exact way that you
convey to a patient, the risk

922
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:45,540
they're facing or their family
member is facing among

923
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:48,250
different treatment options.

924
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:49,740
So is dizziness associated
with a brain tumor?

925
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:53,820
And the answer is no, because
if you do the probabilities,

926
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,170
so the probability of
a tumor is 4:1.

927
00:33:56,170 --> 00:34:00,680
So here's whether you have
the tumor, brain tumor.

928
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,450
And it's one out of four, and
it's one out of four.

929
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:04,980
The odds are identical.

930
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,460
But you're impressed by this
absolute, big number.

931
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:12,440
Intuitively, almost everybody
is, almost all the time.

932
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,739
Here's another one that's
a bit more subtle.

933
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:15,489
It comes up all the time
in medical testing.

934
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:18,150
It's come up in things like
discussions about how often we

935
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:21,940
should test for, if you're a
male, for prostate cancer when

936
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:26,060
you get older; if you're a
female, for breast cancer.

937
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,340
So these kinds of things come
up all the time in decisions

938
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,820
about should you get the tests
or not, and so on.

939
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,130
So imagine now, a hypothetical
syndrome, is a serious

940
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:35,889
condition that affects
one person in 1,000.

941
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:38,760
Imagine also that the test to
diagnose the disease always

942
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,170
indicates correctly that
a person who has it,

943
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,899
actually has it.

944
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:46,300
So if you actually have the
disorder and you get a yes,

945
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,580
you will always be identified.

946
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,630
So that's a good test
in that way.

947
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,880
Finally, suppose the test
occasionally misidentifies a

948
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,620
healthy individual as having
that disorder.

949
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,370
So that's a false positive.

950
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:58,340
The test is a false positive
at a rate of 5%.

951
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,670
Meaning the test wrongly
indicates that the virus is

952
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,640
present in 5% of cases
where the person does

953
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,380
not have the virus.

954
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,280
So if you have it, it's
always correct.

955
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,040
But 5% of healthy people will
be misidentified on the

956
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,470
initial test.

957
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:15,170
Choose a person at random,
administer the test, and the

958
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:17,950
person tests positive
for that syndrome.

959
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:21,630
What is the probability the
person really has that?

960
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:24,760
This is the kind of medical
testing topic that goes on all

961
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,050
the time, all the time.

962
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:30,840

963
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,200
What do you think most people
are going to say?

964
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:35,984

965
00:35:35,984 --> 00:35:36,930
AUDIENCE: 95%.

966
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:38,515
PROFESSOR: Yeah, 95% exactly.

967
00:35:38,515 --> 00:35:40,950
Because he said well, 5%
of the time it's wrong.

968
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,840
But that ignores the base
rate of this order.

969
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,110
Because if there's 1/1000,
then if the other 999 are

970
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:51,140
tested, then you have
about 0.5 times 999.

971
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,580
That means for every 51 who are
tested, only one has it.

972
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,610
So the answer is
only about 2%.

973
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:58,070
Because the odds, the prior
odds, that you have

974
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:00,890
it are so, so low.

975
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:03,470
So that comes into the
likelihood that it's an

976
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:05,710
accurate test and the
false positive rate.

977
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,840
So again, people's intuition
when they hear, their

978
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,560
intuition is there's a 95%
probability that the person

979
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,780
has the disorder.

980
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:18,400
It's really only about 2%, given
the low known base rate.

981
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,650
And if all this is whizzing by
you a bit, I know I'm going

982
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:22,050
through it pretty fast.

983
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,730
But you can think in two ways.

984
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:25,970
You can also think you're a
patient being told this.

985
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:27,420
You're not going to get an
hour long lecture on

986
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,730
probabilities either.

987
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:31,790
So how this is communicated to
physicians, for example in the

988
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:36,120
medical area and families, is
a really big challenge.

989
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,500
So we talked about two
heuristics, that people liked

990
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,850
things to look random, that we
tend to go for what we often

991
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,970
hear about and imagine that's
how frequent or dangerous

992
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:48,920
something is, in a very
broad, intuitive way.

993
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,880
Anchoring and adjustment,
here's a fun one.

994
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,080
So here's the experiment
they did.

995
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,926
They went to people, like in
courtyards around things that

996
00:36:54,926 --> 00:36:56,970
are around Stanford,
actually mostly.

997
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:58,230
And they had them do
the following.

998
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:02,850
They gave them either this
problem or this problem.

999
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:05,230
And here's what happened.

1000
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,270
If they got this problem, and
they quickly had to guess the

1001
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:10,220
answer, they came up
with this many.

1002
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,130
This was their average estimate
and this was the

1003
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,090
average estimate.

1004
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,990
So the first thing we can agree
upon, regardless of the

1005
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:17,070
fact that everybody is
completely underestimating the

1006
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,530
actual answer--

1007
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:21,020
that's almost not the point--

1008
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,810
regardless of that, look
at this estimate.

1009
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:26,840
This rapid estimate is four
times greater than that.

1010
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,260
Why is that happening?

1011
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,890
You're only getting
one or the other.

1012
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,700
But why is that happening?

1013
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,960
This is the heuristic of
anchoring, how people come to

1014
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,210
quick decisions.

1015
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:41,000

1016
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,540
If we go, 8, that's a
pretty big number.

1017
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,000
8, we're talking some big
numbers here, right now.

1018
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,300
They don't even get that they're
going to get to here.

1019
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,890
They start with 1 and 2.

1020
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:54,340
They go, we're talking about
a pretty small thing.

1021
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,630
But I can't quite calculate it
out, because it's too hard to

1022
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,930
calculate it out
for most of us.

1023
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:01,110
This is going to be pretty small
by the time-- so they

1024
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,180
are already thinking small.

1025
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,860
They are already thinking big.

1026
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:08,600
So now you know why, when you
go negotiate for your salary

1027
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,490
somewhere in the future, if
you have any negotiating

1028
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,680
power, start with
a big number.

1029
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,400

1030
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,250
And the person who is
negotiating with you knows

1031
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:20,800
that too, and in fact is often
more practiced than you are.

1032
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,080
So here's a practical clue.

1033
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,470
Start with a big number.

1034
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,960
Because that's the number where
people's minds are.

1035
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,520
And I'll show you several
more examples of how

1036
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,780
ridiculous this is.

1037
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,250
But when there's no true, exact
number that you can

1038
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:32,590
quickly come up with, what's
the fair salary for you to

1039
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:35,770
get, the first year out of MIT
in a job or something?

1040
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:39,100
First number out there,
has a lot of power.

1041
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,540
So here they made
it ridiculous.

1042
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,630
This anchoring, that my mind
start somewhere and I kind of

1043
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,810
stay in that neighborhood.

1044
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:47,750
I don't recalibrate myself.

1045
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:50,420
So they took a wheel of fortune,
a spinning wheel of

1046
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,100
fortune, with the numbers
1 to 100.

1047
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,590
It's clearly random.

1048
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:56,120
Can't make it more obviously
random than that.

1049
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,070
It stops somewhere.

1050
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:59,270
And they say, we want you to
estimate the number of African

1051
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,130
nations in the UN?

1052
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,320
And most people don't
really know.

1053
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,520
And there's some vague sense
that it's more than a couple.

1054
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,170
But who knows how big
it is exactly.

1055
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:08,210
So the number stops somewhere.

1056
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:10,400
And here's the kind of
thing that happens.

1057
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,880
First you say, is it more or
less than the number it

1058
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,780
randomly stopped at?

1059
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:16,170
Let's pretend it
stopped at 65.

1060
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:20,190
Then average estimate was
45 African nations.

1061
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:22,110
Let's say it randomly
stopped at 10.

1062
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:26,170
Then the average estimate
was 25 nations.

1063
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,100
What's happening?

1064
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,390
Anchoring.

1065
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:29,890
You say well, it's
more than 10.

1066
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:33,280
But 10, I'm going to
go way up from 10.

1067
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,820
Because that's way too low.

1068
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,250
And I'll split--

1069
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,980
going beyond 25 seems
hazardous.

1070
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,810
You start at 65.

1071
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,650
You go, whoa, that's
way too many.

1072
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:42,900
But you're anchored.

1073
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,310
And then you use don't
go down that much.

1074
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:47,870
So that first number, when you
don't really know what the

1075
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:50,970
right answer is, has an
incredible power over how far

1076
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:54,300
you range from that, for
your best estimate.

1077
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,450
Same idea.

1078
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,340
Is the Mississippi
River longer or

1079
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,610
shorter than 500 miles?

1080
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:00,120
So they're giving
you the anchor.

1081
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,910
How long is it actually
do you think?

1082
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:04,290
Or another person is asked, is
it longer or shorter than

1083
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:05,550
5,000 miles?

1084
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,520
There's the anchor.

1085
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,750
How long is it, do you think?

1086
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,440
And here's the estimates.

1087
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,100
They're both underestimating.

1088
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,600
But they're moving towards
that number that was

1089
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,260
completely randomly thrown in.

1090
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,360
But it's not random
to the human mind.

1091
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,280
We don't know what the right
number is, but we're going to

1092
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,240
start in the neighborhood that
we first have any number

1093
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,470
presented to us.

1094
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:25,110
Framing.

1095
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:28,900
Framing is arguably, together
with availability, maybe the

1096
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,910
one that's the most interesting
in terms of how

1097
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:34,715
powerful it is and how often
people use it to convince you

1098
00:40:34,715 --> 00:40:37,550
that their political position,
their corporate position,

1099
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:40,540
their anything, is
the way to go.

1100
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:43,300
And once you know framing,
you're empowered a bit to

1101
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,560
think about that, because you
hear arguments made to you

1102
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,460
about what to believe in
or what to support.

1103
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,970
So here comes the framing.

1104
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:50,955
Imagining the United States is
preparing for the outbreak of

1105
00:40:50,955 --> 00:40:53,230
an unusual South American
disease, which is expected to

1106
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,870
kill 600 people.

1107
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,330
Two alternative programs
to combat the

1108
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:57,960
disease have been proposed.

1109
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,290
Assume that the exact scientific
estimate of the

1110
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,960
consequences of the programs
were as follows.

1111
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,580
If Program A is adopted, 200
people will be saved.

1112
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,690
If Program B is adopted,
there's a one-third

1113
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:09,300
probability the 600 people will
be saved and a two-thirds

1114
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,590
probability that no people
will be saved.

1115
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,640
Which program do you favor?

1116
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,590
So B is pretty complicated.

1117
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:17,200
But A is pretty simple,
200 people might be

1118
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,740
saved, will be saved.

1119
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:26,140
So here's the exact same
scenario by lives and deaths,

1120
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:30,600
given to a second group of
research participants.

1121
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,190
If Program A is adopted,
400 people will die.

1122
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:36,460
Do you see that if A is adopted,
200 people are saved,

1123
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:40,110
equals 400 people will die.

1124
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:40,680
It's the same thing.

1125
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,040
There's 600.

1126
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,300
You're really saying
the same outcome.

1127
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:50,450
But that numerical identity
is treated by humans as

1128
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:53,370
incredibly different information
on which to base

1129
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:54,220
your decision.

1130
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,740
And here's what happens.

1131
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,000
If people are given this
scenario, which is explained

1132
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,665
in terms of lives saved, 200
lives saved out of 600, 3/4 of

1133
00:42:01,665 --> 00:42:02,875
the time they pick it.

1134
00:42:02,875 --> 00:42:06,560
If people are given this
scenario, 3/4 of the time they

1135
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,420
don't pick it.

1136
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:11,190
It's the exact same choice.

1137
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:16,220
But to be human, is to gravitate
towards something

1138
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,650
where you save lives
and avoid something

1139
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:20,460
where you lose lives.

1140
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:23,510
Even though numerically, it's
the exact same outcome.

1141
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:26,130
But people radically switch
which one they think is the

1142
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:27,670
correct one, by the
framing of it.

1143
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,610
By simply the way it's
described in

1144
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:31,880
this most simple sense.

1145
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,760
So does that makes sense?

1146
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,745
I mean it's very powerful.

1147
00:42:34,745 --> 00:42:37,200
When people present to you
stuff, how do they present it?

1148
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,700
Lives saved, lives lost; jobs
made, jobs lost; whatever you

1149
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,690
want, money made, money lost.

1150
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:45,060
We don't treat them
as two bits of

1151
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,260
information that are equal.

1152
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,280
We should.

1153
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,390
That's the algorithm,
out of 600 people,

1154
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:53,430
200 people make it.

1155
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:55,680
But that's not how we
psychologically interpret it.

1156
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,940
We go tremendously
by, we're drawn--

1157
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:01,210
any answer that uses the word
"saves", is a positive thing.

1158
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:04,560
And we're averse from any answer
that talks about bad

1159
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,090
things, how many people
will die.

1160
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:07,730
Even though they're
identical in the

1161
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:09,310
consequence of life and death.

1162
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:11,200
Is that clear?

1163
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,040
Very powerful.

1164
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,790
Here's another version of
it now, moving to money.

1165
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:16,480
And it gives you another
feeling of this.

1166
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,650
So you could think about
the top one.

1167
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:21,040
Would you rather have
a sure gain of $75.

1168
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,680
Somebody said, I'll give
you $75 right now.

1169
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,690
Or you can have a lottery where
you have a 75% chance of

1170
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:29,430
winning $100, so that's even
more, or a 25% chance of

1171
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:30,680
winning nothing at all.

1172
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,970

1173
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:35,630
Another group of people
get this question.

1174
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:37,540
We're going to take
from you $75.

1175
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:40,781
It's a rough experiment
to sign up for.

1176
00:43:40,781 --> 00:43:44,220
Or you're going to be in a
lottery with a 75% chance of

1177
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:48,060
losing $100, which is even a
worse loss, and 25% chance of

1178
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,460
losing nothing at all.

1179
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,260
So these are meant to be kind
of symmetric stories.

1180
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:56,370
But one is expressed all in
terms of gain and one all in

1181
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:57,590
terms of losses.

1182
00:43:57,590 --> 00:44:02,380
And when people are thinking
about gains,

1183
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:03,890
they're risk averse.

1184
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:06,590
I'm not going to give up
what's in my hands.

1185
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:10,520
So 84% of the time,
they take that.

1186
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,110
Even though this is sort of
formally similar because it's

1187
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:17,350
a loss, now when it's losses,
people are risk taking.

1188
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:19,470
Humans are very asymmetric.

1189
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:21,750
If things are expressed in
gains, we're risk averse.

1190
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:22,970
Let's do the safe thing.

1191
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:25,740
I'm going to hang on to what's
already in my grasp.

1192
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:28,730
If it's in terms of loss, it's
like, let's bet the house,

1193
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:30,670
let's do any crazy,
wild thing.

1194
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:33,910
Because losses are so bad
that I'll take any

1195
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:35,900
chance to avoid a loss.

1196
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,980
Even though rationally, the
choices should be about the

1197
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:42,460
same, if we were machines
making choices.

1198
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,060
Very big difference.

1199
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:45,820
I mean when I first
heard about these

1200
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:46,730
things, I was stunned.

1201
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:48,650
Because it's huge.

1202
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:51,120
Everything that we vote for,
everything that we support,

1203
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,730
every decision we make about
careers, and policies that we

1204
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:57,960
are for or against, are always
being expressed to us in a

1205
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,350
framework like this.

1206
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:01,920
Things that we can gain or lose
in our own lives, in the

1207
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,870
world, in societies.

1208
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:07,790
And you spin around so easily
by how they're framed.

1209
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:08,980
Although now you
know something.

1210
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:10,230
And you can think about them.

1211
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:12,570

1212
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:14,830
Here's just two odds and ends
things, that I thought were

1213
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:17,470
kind of fun.

1214
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:19,800
Other things that people find
kind of challenging to think

1215
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,320
their way through, just because
of the way our minds

1216
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:22,920
are constructed.

1217
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,390
So here's a problem.

1218
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:27,480
Jack is looking at Anne, but
Anne is looking at George.

1219
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,260
Jack is married, but
George is not.

1220
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:32,750
Here's your problem
to think about.

1221
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:39,040
Is a married person looking at
an unmarried person, yes, no,

1222
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,290
or cannot be determined?

1223
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:46,970

1224
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:48,560
The only reason I know the
answers to these is because I

1225
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,830
have the answers to these.

1226
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,480
The first time I see these,
I'm like, oh no.

1227
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:57,500
So just for fun.

1228
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,970
You can go by intuition and
maybe you worked it out or you

1229
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:01,170
looked ahead.

1230
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:05,420
How many people who haven't
looked ahead, say yes?

1231
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:07,360
OK, there's some hands, 10.

1232
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,360
How many say no?

1233
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:09,580
Nobody.

1234
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:11,750
How many say, cannot
be determined?

1235
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:14,680
The answer is, that's good.

1236
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:18,046
Most answer, 80% say cannot
be determined.

1237
00:46:18,046 --> 00:46:20,800
But the answer is this.

1238
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,390
Think about this.

1239
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:22,160
The answer is yes.

1240
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,340
And here's why.

1241
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,510
We don't know Anne's
marital status.

1242
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:25,200
The other two are given.

1243
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,230
So we have to figure out
Anne's situation.

1244
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:28,860
Let's say she's married.

1245
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:31,150
Then she's looking at
unmarried George.

1246
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:31,960
Let's say she's not married.

1247
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,070
Then Jack is looking
at unmarried Anne.

1248
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:34,420
Is that OK?

1249
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,560
This is what people in logic,
call fully disjunctive

1250
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:40,610
reasoning, where if you work
your way through the

1251
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:43,140
possibilities, you see
it has to work out.

1252
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:46,930
But that's not our intuitions.

1253
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:51,250
I mean you're a very
smart group.

1254
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:54,620
So if it's hard for you, imagine
the rest of the world

1255
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:57,250
is not as suspicious about how
to figure their problems out.

1256
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:00,010
So it's just fantastically
interesting how the human mind

1257
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:01,410
is brilliant at some things.

1258
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:05,850
And for other things, it could
solve, it could solve,

1259
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:07,970
intuitively, it's not often
going to happen.

1260
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:10,450
We go by these shortcuts where
either we don't get the answer

1261
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:12,690
at all or we come up with a
completely wrong one, because

1262
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:15,450
of availability or framing.

1263
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:15,970
Here's a quick one.

1264
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:17,100
You'll get this fast.

1265
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:17,740
It's fun.

1266
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:20,810
A ball and a bat cost
$1.10 in total.

1267
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:22,100
The bat cost a dollar
more than the ball.

1268
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:25,330
How much did the ball cost?

1269
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:26,780
All right, you guys are now,
you're very suspicious.

1270
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:28,150
You're thinking it through.

1271
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:30,330
Most people love $0.10.

1272
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:33,330
But you can tell that's
not going to work?

1273
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:35,520
Because then the bat would have
to cost $1.10 and the

1274
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,700
total would be $1.20.

1275
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:44,230
But a lot you were pulled to,
most of us to, having a $1.10,

1276
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:45,490
because we don't quite
think it through.

1277
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:46,030
There's $1.00.

1278
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,060
There's $0.10.

1279
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:49,400
And we do these shortcuts, these
heuristics, instead of

1280
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,250
logically working
our way through.

1281
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:54,390
One more example of this
kind of thing.

1282
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:55,950
Because now we're going
to add one more

1283
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:56,940
element just for this.

1284
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,950
Imagine that the US Department
of Transportation has found

1285
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:00,860
that a particular German car
is eight times more likely

1286
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:03,370
than a typical family car to
kill occupants of another car

1287
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:04,500
in a crash.

1288
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,260
The federal government is
considering restricting sale

1289
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:07,230
and use of this German car.

1290
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:09,090
Do you think sales of the German
car should be banned in

1291
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:12,300
the US or do you think the
German car should be banned

1292
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,670
from being driven on
the US streets?

1293
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:18,860
So here's one, given in this
study to US participants.

1294
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:20,600
Or to do exactly the same
thing, but it's

1295
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,690
not a German car.

1296
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:22,940
It's a Ford Explorer.

1297
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:25,960

1298
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:29,600
So American participants, if
it's a German car, 73%, get

1299
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,610
that car off the road.

1300
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:35,230
If it's a Ford Explorer,
sorry.

1301
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:37,300
If a German car, off the
streets, you get 73%, If it's

1302
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:40,110
the American car, and Germany
is making the decision, only

1303
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:43,560
40% of the people think that
Germany should do that.

1304
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,400
Now, that's not purely logic.

1305
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,280
What is that?

1306
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,130
That's bias, right?

1307
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:51,140
That's like, yeah, on my
streets, we don't want these

1308
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:53,720
threatening machines
from overseas.

1309
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:55,730
Germany, we've got to keep
that economy going.

1310
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:58,310
Those Ford workers are really
doing a good job.

1311
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:02,340
So of course most decisions
aren't hyperrational in the

1312
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:03,860
way we've been talking about,
unknown people.

1313
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:06,800
Of course they involve things
in the world that we already

1314
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,650
have feelings about.

1315
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:10,500
So you add that in and you can
see that making a truly

1316
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,690
logical judgment is shockingly
hard, if anything is a little

1317
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:15,750
complicated.

1318
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:19,370
So let me turn for the last
little bit to what we think of

1319
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:22,260
as some of the core parts of
the brain for higher level

1320
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:25,770
thought, the struggle we have
between the best we have in

1321
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:28,730
our mind and the traps
we can fall into.

1322
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:32,650
And when we talk about that,
we tend to focus on sort of

1323
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:33,820
three areas of the
frontal lobe.

1324
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:36,380
So let me just remind
you of this.

1325
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:39,370
So here's the frontal lobes.

1326
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:41,210
And you could think of the
frontal lobe I think as the

1327
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:43,210
business end of the brain.

1328
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:45,510
Here comes visual information
coming in, auditory

1329
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:47,800
information coming in,
touch coming in.

1330
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:51,760
Somewhere back here,
would be taste.

1331
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,750
So that's getting stuck in and
figuring out what's out there.

1332
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:57,350
So the front half is the
business end of the brain,

1333
00:49:57,350 --> 00:49:58,360
acting upon the world.

1334
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:01,020
Moving your hands, moving your
body, making decisions about

1335
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:02,580
what you do.

1336
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:06,100
Motor cortex, premotor cortex,
a guy's motor cortex.

1337
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,340
This so-called lateral
prefrontal cortex, that's

1338
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:10,030
higher levels of thought.

1339
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:12,900
And this bottom part of
ventromedial or orbitofrontal

1340
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:15,920
cortex, that we talked about
with Phineas Gage.

1341
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,260
So Oliver Sacks, in Chapter 13,
talks about one example of

1342
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:25,330
a woman who has a large tumor
in this ventromedial area.

1343
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:29,610
So sometimes I think there's a
Roman philosopher who said

1344
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:33,130
that life is composed of desires
and decisions, desires

1345
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:34,070
and decisions.

1346
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:36,400
So this part of the brain is
involved in desires and this

1347
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,210
part in decisions.

1348
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:39,210
And I'll show that,
roughly speaking.

1349
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:42,620
So here's a woman who is a
former research chemist.

1350
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:44,830
And she has a rapid personality
change, becoming

1351
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:47,450
facetious, impulsive,
superficial.

1352
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:49,430
And she a cerebral
tumor in this

1353
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:51,540
ventromedial part of the brain.

1354
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:53,540
When I see her, she's full
of quips and cracks,

1355
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:55,020
often clever and funny.

1356
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:57,425
Yes, father, she says to me on
one occasion; yes, sister, on

1357
00:50:57,425 --> 00:50:59,230
another; yes, doctor,
on a third.

1358
00:50:59,230 --> 00:50:59,960
What am I?

1359
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,620
And then she make some jokes.

1360
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:03,260
So she's constantly joking.

1361
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:08,030
And she says, everything
means nothing.

1362
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:10,090
Nothing at all, she says with
a bright smile and a tone of

1363
00:51:10,090 --> 00:51:13,020
one who makes a joke, wins an
argument, or wins at poker.

1364
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:17,090
So she just finds that sort of
there are facts of the world,

1365
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:20,010
but they just don't feel like
they mean anything.

1366
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:22,460
Because a tumor is influencing
a part of the brain that we

1367
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:26,450
understand to organize the
relationship between thoughts

1368
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,450
and feelings, between thoughts
and feelings.

1369
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:31,150
And that's a huge way about
how we go about the world,

1370
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:32,650
what we think, what we feel.

1371
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:34,360
We've put it into a formula
of some sense.

1372
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,590
And that's how we act upon the
world, whether we help

1373
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:38,390
somebody, or don't help
somebody, like somebody, or

1374
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:39,350
don't like somebody.

1375
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:40,860
All those sorts of things.

1376
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:47,690
So when we think about behavior,
we normally think of

1377
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:49,830
the challenge of getting
it going.

1378
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:52,020
You get in your car and you
turn on and you accelerate

1379
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:53,190
from 0 to 60.

1380
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:55,680
But a really interesting thing
about the human brain is that

1381
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:59,030
we have lots of habits, things
we acquire about how to deal

1382
00:51:59,030 --> 00:51:59,640
with the world.

1383
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:03,540
So just as big a problem for
our brains is stopping the

1384
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:07,490
course of action that's
no longer relevant.

1385
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:10,520
So the frontal cortex both has
the job of initiating things,

1386
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,870
but also stopping things.

1387
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:14,280
And you can see it in a couple
of ways, I'll show you.

1388
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:15,860
So here's an example
of a patient with a

1389
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:17,880
frontal lobe injury.

1390
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:21,090
They're drawn this scratchily,
by a physician.

1391
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:22,480
And here's their exact copy.

1392
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,950
Do you see they can't stop?

1393
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:26,590
Here's again the model,

1394
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:27,750
scratched out by the physician.

1395
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:28,460
Look at the patient.

1396
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:30,360
The patient can't stop.

1397
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,000
So the problem's not starting.

1398
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,060
The problem is stopping the
mental operation once it's

1399
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:36,550
going and repeating.

1400
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:39,250
And it's hard to put on
the mental breaks.

1401
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:42,860
Here's an example of a
behavioral test of that kind.

1402
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,650
And I remember this, when I was
testing patients in E17

1403
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:48,170
and E18 here, I did
this a fair bit.

1404
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:50,770
It's called the Wisconsin
Card Sorting Test.

1405
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:54,330
And what happens is, you put
on four cards like these.

1406
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:54,930
These are the key cards.

1407
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:56,310
It's very mysterious when
you give the test.

1408
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:58,400
You just put them down.

1409
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,860
And you have a pile of
cards over here.

1410
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:03,410
And you tell the person, your
job is to pick a card from

1411
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:07,090
this pile and put it below
one of these cards.

1412
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:10,370
And I'll tell you if you're
right or wrong.

1413
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:12,120
And then use that information
to know where to

1414
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,840
put the next card.

1415
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,800
So imagine you are doing this
experiment, and if you're

1416
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,440
color blind, there's
an extra issue.

1417
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:17,960
I'll just warn you.

1418
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,610
But you get this first card.

1419
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:21,960
Where would you put it below?

1420
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,516
Where could you put it below?

1421
00:53:23,516 --> 00:53:25,500
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1422
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,140
PROFESSOR: OK.

1423
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:27,090
That has an equal number.

1424
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:27,840
That's one possibility.

1425
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,430
What's another possibility, as
the rule by which you might

1426
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:31,510
sort the card?

1427
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:31,980
AUDIENCE: Color.

1428
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:32,510
PROFESSOR: Color.

1429
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:33,110
Yeah, that's green.

1430
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:33,650
That goes with that.

1431
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:35,340
What's another possibility
that you can see?

1432
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:35,635
Shape.

1433
00:53:35,635 --> 00:53:37,320
You can say that's a plus sign,
that's a plus sign.

1434
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,770
They all seem reasonable.

1435
00:53:38,770 --> 00:53:40,915
So people usually pick
one of those three.

1436
00:53:40,915 --> 00:53:44,510
And if they happen to pick the
one that I as a tester know

1437
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:47,070
from my instruction sheet,
it's my job to reinforce.

1438
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:49,770
Let's pretend it starts
with color.

1439
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:51,920
If they do this, I go wrong.

1440
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,020
I go, hmm.

1441
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:55,930
And they pick another card and
they try something else.

1442
00:53:55,930 --> 00:53:58,160
They pick another card and
they try something else.

1443
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,200
And after three or four
cards, people pretty

1444
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,830
much get the color.

1445
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:04,240
And then you go get
another card out.

1446
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,840
You go right, right, right,
right right, wrong.

1447
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:10,980
And when I did this, I was
approximately your age.

1448
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:12,430
And most of the patients
I tested were older.

1449
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:15,180
And they go like, sonny, look
back on your score sheet

1450
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:16,140
because it's correct.

1451
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:17,580
And I go no ma'am, no sir.

1452
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:18,170
I'm sorry about that.

1453
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:19,520
But it's wrong.

1454
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,050
Because what you do is after
10 consecutive correct

1455
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:26,910
responses, you switch the rule
from color to shape.

1456
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:29,510
After 10 correct shape,
you switch to number.

1457
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:30,360
And then you do that again.

1458
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,400
So you switch the
rule after 10.

1459
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,500
So it's a test of mental
flexibility, in a fairly

1460
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:36,090
simple way.

1461
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:37,300
Does that make sense?

1462
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,040
They have to figure out
what the answer is.

1463
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:39,960
Then they're zooming along.

1464
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,806
And you go, no stop.

1465
00:54:41,806 --> 00:54:44,160
And you have to come up
with the next answer.

1466
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,790
So here's what happens for
patients with frontal lobe

1467
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:50,490
lesions, they make a huge
amount of what's called

1468
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:52,260
perseverative errors.

1469
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:55,550
So this is now the intellectual
analog of the too

1470
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:57,320
many squiggles.

1471
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:01,870
Once they get that first rule,
they can't stop that rule.

1472
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:04,150
So they go color, color,
color, color, color.

1473
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:05,740
They get about 10.

1474
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:06,640
So you switch.

1475
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,730
And they just keep doing it.

1476
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:11,150
You go no, wrong, wrong,
wrong, wrong, wrong.

1477
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:14,310
But they can't stop the rule
that worked in the first

1478
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:17,950
place, without the prefrontal
cortex being intact.

1479
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:20,800
So our mental flexibility seems
to depend tremendously

1480
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,470
on prefrontal cortex.

1481
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:24,510
And you can do the same kind of
thing in imaging, just to

1482
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:25,740
make sure it's not just
a patient thing.

1483
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:29,090
And again, when you have to do
this very same kind of task,

1484
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:32,410
typical people activate
prefrontal cortex to do the

1485
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:36,490
mental manipulation of the
simple problem solving task.

1486
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:38,640
So we talked about
perserveration and its hard to

1487
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,000
stop and mental flexibility.

1488
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,240
With ventromedial lesions, you
get some weird things.

1489
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,960
You get what they call
utilization behaviors.

1490
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,720
So again, we're having this
idea what's the good thing

1491
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,820
about having very
powerful habits?

1492
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:53,400

1493
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,980
Is it very good to have very
powerful habits, and we use a

1494
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:59,470
different word for this,
when you read?

1495
00:55:59,470 --> 00:55:59,930
Yeah.

1496
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:00,820
Because that's how you're
a fast reader.

1497
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:02,990
You know how to read
words really fast.

1498
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:07,126
Is it good to have very powerful
habits when you walk?

1499
00:56:07,126 --> 00:56:07,710
Yeah.

1500
00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:10,050
You don't want to go like, OK,
I'm moving the leg now.

1501
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:10,860
Everybody get ready.

1502
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:11,780
We're moving the other leg.

1503
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:13,540
Because you could never get
out of the room very

1504
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:14,340
efficiently.

1505
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:17,090
So for many, many things, having
very powerful habits

1506
00:56:17,090 --> 00:56:17,840
are very strong.

1507
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:21,650
But for other things, they're
not as good and you have to

1508
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:22,270
put the brakes on.

1509
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:24,480
So Lhermitte described patients
with ventromedial

1510
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,150
lesions who came in,
saw in his office.

1511
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:28,300
This was not a set-up
experiment.

1512
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:29,440
He didn't expect this.

1513
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,694
There was a hammer, a
nail, and a picture.

1514
00:56:30,694 --> 00:56:32,550
And the patient just
goes over, up.

1515
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:34,770
And you could imagine, if you
go into the doctor's office

1516
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:37,710
and you see a hammer, a nail,
and a picture, would you go

1517
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:39,630
over and put up the picture?

1518
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:40,740
No.

1519
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,610
I mean you know that's what
you do with that stuff.

1520
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:44,140
You know that's what's
going on.

1521
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:45,730
But you go, that's not my place
to do it, even though

1522
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:46,750
it's attempted to do it.

1523
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:48,450
The patient could not help
himself but go do that,

1524
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:49,740
literally go do that.

1525
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:52,090
The most dramatic example was,
the patient walks in and sees

1526
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:54,080
a hypodermic needle, pulls down
his pants, and injects

1527
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,810
himself in the derriere.

1528
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:59,740
So again, he knew that
was going to happen.

1529
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:01,060
He knew that's the habit.

1530
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:02,950
But you wouldn't go into a
doctor's office and start

1531
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:05,160
using their stuff and
perform on yourself.

1532
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:05,680
You understand.

1533
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,330
The habits are completely
running the show.

1534
00:57:08,330 --> 00:57:11,010
And any kind of frontal cortical
control of those

1535
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:14,030
habits has been eliminated
in these patients.

1536
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:15,115
And here's a couple
more things that

1537
00:57:15,115 --> 00:57:16,920
are along that line.

1538
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:20,550
So I need a volunteer, in your
seats, to try something with

1539
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:21,800
me for a minute.

1540
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,730

1541
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:25,080
It's not bad.

1542
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,420
I think I've traumatized
you in these examples.

1543
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,250
OK, thank you.

1544
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:30,970
If you had to answer this
question, and there's no

1545
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:31,530
correct answer.

1546
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:33,110
But let's just talk about
how you might do it.

1547
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:35,577
How long is a man's
spine, on average?

1548
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:37,020
AUDIENCE: About two feet?

1549
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,220
PROFESSOR: And how did you
kind of come to that?

1550
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:39,548
And that might be
right or not.

1551
00:57:39,548 --> 00:57:42,416
AUDIENCE: My back is roughly
two feet long.

1552
00:57:42,416 --> 00:57:45,290
My spine is--

1553
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:45,660
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1554
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:47,280
It's got to be less
seven feet.

1555
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,750
Because that's like the tallest
basketball players.

1556
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:51,950
On average, it's got to be
more than a couple feet.

1557
00:57:51,950 --> 00:57:52,890
Something in that range.

1558
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:54,680
OK, you just guessed
which it was.

1559
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,860
Or how fast does a horse
in a race gallop?

1560
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:59,720
Or what's the largest object
normally found in the house?

1561
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,854
What do you think
that might be?

1562
00:58:01,854 --> 00:58:02,730
AUDIENCE: Fridge?

1563
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:03,500
PROFESSOR: Help me out here.

1564
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:03,830
AUDIENCE: A refrigerator.

1565
00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:04,970
PROFESSOR: A refrigerator
is a good one.

1566
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:06,052
Anybody else?

1567
00:58:06,052 --> 00:58:07,290
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1568
00:58:07,290 --> 00:58:08,110
PROFESSOR: All those are good.

1569
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:09,600
Is toaster a good answer?

1570
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,310
No.

1571
00:58:11,310 --> 00:58:11,880
One more person.

1572
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:12,650
Who's going to help
me out here?

1573
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:13,900
One more example.

1574
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:21,160

1575
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:21,780
Come on.

1576
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:22,100
One more example.

1577
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:22,340
It's easy.

1578
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:23,580
OK, thank you, Rich.

1579
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:26,090
How many camels are there
in the Netherlands?

1580
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:27,310
Now, nobody knows.

1581
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:30,010
But tell me a thought process
roughly, so you would come up

1582
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:31,063
with an estimate.

1583
00:58:31,063 --> 00:58:32,050
AUDIENCE: 100.

1584
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:32,600
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1585
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,830
Because are you going to figure
there's a lot in the

1586
00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:35,785
Netherlands?

1587
00:58:35,785 --> 00:58:36,140
No.

1588
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:37,850
Because there's no
desert, right?

1589
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:40,410
Where might you find a few?

1590
00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:42,610
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1591
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:43,976
PROFESSOR: On a ranch.

1592
00:58:43,976 --> 00:58:46,660
I haven't been to Amsterdam
for a while, so perhaps

1593
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:50,395
there's a few loping around
in the canals.

1594
00:58:50,395 --> 00:58:54,130
And some zoo, some kids' petting
thing, who knows?

1595
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:56,030
So, yeah, 100 sounds
good to me.

1596
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:58,860
But frontal patients will
give really bad answers,

1597
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:00,620
thousands or zero.

1598
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,560
Or 12 feet for a spinal cord.

1599
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:03,600
Or just something that
you go like, where

1600
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,250
did you come up that?

1601
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,760
You can do the Price Is
Right game with them.

1602
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,920
They'll come up with more
ridiculous answers.

1603
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:09,950
Here's just a graph.

1604
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:12,770
These are bad answers for how
expensive something is, just

1605
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:14,280
unreasonable answers
within these sort

1606
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:15,760
of open-ended questions.

1607
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,330
Or you can do more
formal problems.

1608
00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:20,640
The kind of problem
where you're given

1609
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:21,380
a puzzle like this.

1610
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:24,900
And your job is to move these
into a target state.

1611
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:27,730
And so to get over to here,
you've got to move the blue

1612
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:32,160
guy over here and whatever, in
a different number of moves.

1613
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,310
That's planning ahead
and problem solving.

1614
00:59:34,310 --> 00:59:36,790
Patients with frontal lobe
lesions make many mistakes on

1615
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:39,470
these kinds of tasks.

1616
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:41,210
So the last thing I want to
talk is a little bit about

1617
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:44,390
Phineas Gage kind of lesions.

1618
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:49,120
And we'll get in a moment to a
comment about serial killers.

1619
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,120
So Phineas Gage had
this huge injury.

1620
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,320
We talked about him
already in the

1621
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:55,730
ventromedial prefrontal cortex.

1622
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:58,090
There's some other patients
who have orbitofrontal

1623
00:59:58,090 --> 00:59:59,030
lesions, who have
been studied.

1624
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:00,210
And let me tell you
a little bit about

1625
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:02,050
what's known about them.

1626
01:00:02,050 --> 01:00:03,590
And I can tell you this is the
part of the brain that's been

1627
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:07,180
most implicated in psychopaths,
some of whom turn

1628
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:10,110
out to be these serial
killers.

1629
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:12,360
One measure they've used in
these experiments is galvanic

1630
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,250
skin response.

1631
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:14,360
That's the kind of
stuff they use in

1632
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,730
polygraphs, lie detectors.

1633
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:19,220
They put them on your skin and
what they measure is responses

1634
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:22,190
that are related to
sweat glands.

1635
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:26,430
So it's a measure of emotional
reactivity, basically.

1636
01:00:26,430 --> 01:00:28,020
Here's a really interesting
thing.

1637
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:30,820
If we measure your galvanic skin
response and we show you

1638
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:33,320
faces of people you know, family
members, friends, and

1639
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:36,730
so on, versus people you don't
know, you get a galvanic skin

1640
01:00:36,730 --> 01:00:38,510
response for the people
you know, because

1641
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:39,780
they matter to you.

1642
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:44,030
It's an emotional response,
versus faces you don't know.

1643
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:46,350
You even get that kind of
strikingly in several studies

1644
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:47,850
in patients with
prosopagnosia.

1645
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:50,280
So we talked about those
patients who can't recognize

1646
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,890
people by their faces.

1647
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:54,620
But something in them still
recognizes who's

1648
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:57,120
familiar and who's not.

1649
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:00,030
Even if they can't tell you,
that's my mother or that's my

1650
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:02,980
father or that's my brother,
their galvanic skin response

1651
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:06,210
is a pretty good response.

1652
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:07,520
Patients with orbitofrontal
lesions

1653
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,140
are exactly the opposite.

1654
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:11,830
When they're shown pictures of
family members and friends,

1655
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:15,280
they have no more of a response
in the sweat glands,

1656
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,300
in the autonomic nervous system,
than they do for

1657
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:19,120
absolute strangers.

1658
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:22,220
And you might intuitively
imagine that it's pretty easy

1659
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:25,730
to lie and deceive your friends
and family, if they

1660
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:27,420
don't mean to you anything more

1661
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:28,670
than an absolute stranger.

1662
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:30,890

1663
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:32,640
No galvanic response
to emotional

1664
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:33,990
versus neutral pictures.

1665
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:36,420
And so these patients seem to
have this disconnection

1666
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:37,660
between thought and emotion.

1667
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:39,160
They know who the person is.

1668
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:41,620
But they don't have an emotional
response of any kind

1669
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:43,460
to that person.

1670
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:46,020
And here's one clever experiment
that shows some of

1671
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:47,560
the consequence of that.

1672
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:49,780
So this is work from Damasio
and his colleagues.

1673
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:51,670
So they took a couple
of these patients.

1674
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:53,020
There's not that many of them.

1675
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:55,160
And they put them into an
experiment where you could

1676
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,410
pick from two decks.

1677
01:01:56,410 --> 01:01:58,100
One deck has a low immediate
reward, but

1678
01:01:58,100 --> 01:01:59,860
positive long-term rewards.

1679
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:02,410
It's a little bit like studying
a lot, and hoping it

1680
01:02:02,410 --> 01:02:03,930
all pays off.

1681
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:06,490
And another one is high
immediate rewards, but higher

1682
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:07,270
long-term losses.

1683
01:02:07,270 --> 01:02:10,860
Like not studying has some
unpleasant consequences.

1684
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:12,040
So two decks of cards.

1685
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:15,570
And you don't know this, but you
just quickly discover that

1686
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:21,120
Pile A, you get the occasional
$50, but you often lose $100.

1687
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:25,460
But Pile B, you get the thrill
of the $100 loss, but you

1688
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:27,730
often lose $1,000.

1689
01:02:27,730 --> 01:02:30,310
So they're kind of pitting
against each other, the thrill

1690
01:02:30,310 --> 01:02:36,500
of the $100 win, versus the
certain doom of the quick

1691
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:38,450
thrill pile.

1692
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:41,510
You get the quick thrill,
but it will doom you.

1693
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:43,270
So what do typical people do?

1694
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:45,480
After a little while, they
figure out well, Pile B is

1695
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:46,680
pretty fun when I
get the $100.

1696
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,270
But it beats me up a lot in the
long term, so they go for

1697
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:50,180
Pile A.

1698
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:51,650
Orbitofrontal patients don't.

1699
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:54,470
They go for that one-time
thrill, over any long-term

1700
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:56,720
consequences.

1701
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:59,830
As interesting as that, if you
measure the galvanic skin

1702
01:02:59,830 --> 01:03:05,650
response, for control people,
typical people, when they go

1703
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:10,040
for the risky pile, their heart
is pounding, their hands

1704
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:10,230
are sweating.

1705
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:13,390
And they go, I'm going to
walk on the wild side.

1706
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:15,320
Back to the save file, mostly.

1707
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:17,340
No galvanic skin response
for the patients with

1708
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:17,690
orbitofrontal lesions.

1709
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:18,117
Yeah?

1710
01:03:18,117 --> 01:03:20,370
AUDIENCE: Do people
get the lesions

1711
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:22,930
after reaching adulthood?

1712
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:23,640
PROFESSOR: So this
is interesting.

1713
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:26,620
I'm going to come to
this in a moment.

1714
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:29,330
Actually literally, absolutely
right now.

1715
01:03:29,330 --> 01:03:31,680
Same pattern for people who
have these injuries at 15

1716
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:34,500
months or three months, as
happens in adulthood.

1717
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:36,590
Now, we don't know if
that's everybody.

1718
01:03:36,590 --> 01:03:39,290
But these are patients who
came forth with problems.

1719
01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:40,800
So this is a little bit like,
we don't know if there are a

1720
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,860
lot of people with damage there,
who are not doing this.

1721
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:47,160
But these two patients who
they studied, had that.

1722
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,380
And they got in lots
of trouble in

1723
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:49,220
school, all the time.

1724
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:51,770
They did all the things
you might imagine a

1725
01:03:51,770 --> 01:03:53,660
three-year-old, and for
the rest of us, like

1726
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:55,700
Phineas Gage would do.

1727
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:57,890
So that raises the question
about whether the kinds of

1728
01:03:57,890 --> 01:04:02,020
people who behave in this most
disturbing, psychopathic,

1729
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:06,540
serial killer fashion have
either an injury or something

1730
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:11,310
like that, that makes them
predisposed to being very

1731
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:12,810
inhumane in the way they
think about people.

1732
01:04:12,810 --> 01:04:15,480

1733
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:18,010
And just in case you, as careful
MIT scientists, worry

1734
01:04:18,010 --> 01:04:20,210
about well, maybe they're not
having a GSR that works at

1735
01:04:20,210 --> 01:04:22,220
all, what does that mean?

1736
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:25,720
If these patients who had the
damage early in childhood just

1737
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:30,780
get a loud tone, a big boat
horn, like ooh, there's a

1738
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:32,620
galvanic skin response that
looks pretty good.

1739
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:35,880
So it's not their autonomic
system won't respond to

1740
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:38,430
emotionally provocative things,
like a big sound.

1741
01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:40,980
It just doesn't respond to
emotionally provocative things

1742
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:44,600
like risk and people you
should care about.

1743
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:48,250

1744
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:49,810
And I'll just end in
this one minute.

1745
01:04:49,810 --> 01:04:54,650
So this is an area where a
guy, Kent Khiel, at the

1746
01:04:54,650 --> 01:04:55,350
University of New Mexico.

1747
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:56,150
You can go look this up.

1748
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:57,850
It's an amazing story.

1749
01:04:57,850 --> 01:05:01,830
He's very interested in these
brain differences in

1750
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:02,640
psychopaths in prison.

1751
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:05,280
Many are in prison because
they're scary people.

1752
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,150
So you can't get them out to
do research very easily.

1753
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:09,070
So he has a truck with
an MR scanner.

1754
01:05:09,070 --> 01:05:12,030
And he drives from penitentiary
to penitentiary

1755
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:14,240
and does brain scanning
with these people.

1756
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:16,650
And is getting on average,
some differences

1757
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:18,480
in this brain region.

1758
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:22,600
So I have a question for you,
just for one minute.

1759
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,935
Do you think that should be
introduced in a court case for

1760
01:05:24,935 --> 01:05:26,185
a serial killer?

1761
01:05:26,185 --> 01:05:30,840

1762
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:34,510
If he gets up there and shows
you brain pictures, should a

1763
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:38,550
jury hear about that or should
they not hear about that, for

1764
01:05:38,550 --> 01:05:41,416
somebody who's done an
awful murder or an

1765
01:05:41,416 --> 01:05:42,060
awful string murders?

1766
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:43,330
AUDIENCE: I'd say no.

1767
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:44,430
PROFESSOR: Sorry.

1768
01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:45,000
You say no.

1769
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:45,695
Because what?

1770
01:05:45,695 --> 01:05:49,102
AUDIENCE: I think that the risk
is too great that you

1771
01:05:49,102 --> 01:05:51,587
will have innocent
people be shown.

1772
01:05:51,587 --> 01:05:54,072
And the science is not fully
resolved yet in that respect.

1773
01:05:54,072 --> 01:05:56,805
There are also a lot of
salient factors and

1774
01:05:56,805 --> 01:05:59,539
environmental factors that
have been constrained by

1775
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:03,515
genetics, and say, oh, if you
have this huge issue, this

1776
01:06:03,515 --> 01:06:07,550
condition of the brain, you're
automatically [INAUDIBLE].

1777
01:06:07,550 --> 01:06:08,260
PROFESSOR: OK.

1778
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:09,330
Let me tell one sentence.

1779
01:06:09,330 --> 01:06:10,230
Yeah, go ahead.

1780
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:13,530
AUDIENCE: You know the
correlation in one direction--

1781
01:06:13,530 --> 01:06:15,780
PROFESSOR: We don't know.

1782
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:16,430
These are good points.

1783
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:18,480
Let me just say, so here's where
we stand now, because

1784
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,320
this will be your lives in
the future, in a lot

1785
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:21,940
of different ways.

1786
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:25,580
Where we stand now is, for the
first time ever, brain imaging

1787
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:29,180
evidence was introduced in the
court case about a year ago of

1788
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:31,300
a serial killer.

1789
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:33,120
They were only allowed
to do it--

1790
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,820
court cases like this go
through two phases.

1791
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:36,520
You see these in TV
shows or movies.

1792
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:38,300
There's the initial trial.

1793
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:40,440
And if the person is found
guilty, there's a second phase

1794
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:42,280
where they decide what the
appropriate penalty is.

1795
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:46,520
The judge said they could only
be reported in the penalty

1796
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,350
phase, when people were thinking
about what's the

1797
01:06:48,350 --> 01:06:51,610
right punishment for a person,
not before the conviction.

1798
01:06:51,610 --> 01:06:54,640
And they said they couldn't
show any color pictures of

1799
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:55,660
brain stuff, because that would

1800
01:06:55,660 --> 01:06:58,510
over-influence the jurors.

1801
01:06:58,510 --> 01:07:00,330
And so you could only talk
about this stuff.

1802
01:07:00,330 --> 01:07:02,040
Because if you showed a brain
picture, sort of like you

1803
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:04,600
said, it would look so
scientific that they were

1804
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:08,330
afraid it overwhelm the
jurors' judgment.

1805
01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:11,690
So this is all coming up, about
what the brain maybe do

1806
01:07:11,690 --> 01:07:12,570
in your lifetimes.

1807
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:13,820
Thanks.

1808
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:24,628
