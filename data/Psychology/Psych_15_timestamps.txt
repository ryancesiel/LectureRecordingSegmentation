10
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,670
PROFESSOR: Sometimes
psychologists like to talk

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,570
about two aspects of our mind,
the hot and the cool.

12
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,290
So the cool parts we've been
talking about recently,

13
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,970
thinking parts, like language,
thought, things related to

14
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:52,540
intelligence, problem solving,
the rational aspects of the

15
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,630
human mind.

16
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,360
And today we're going to focus
on maybe the hottest of the

17
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:01,240
hot, the emotions that we feel
and that color our lives in

18
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:06,120
terms of intensity and arousal
and what matters to us.

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,590
And so we'll talk a little bit
about, just very briefly about

20
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,410
a thumbnail history of the
study of emotion, the

21
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:15,160
scientific study of emotion,
ideas about how to define it,

22
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,430
a few models of emotion, how
emotion might work, some big

23
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:22,440
questions about things like is
emotion universal, does it

24
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,990
correlate to bodily feelings?

25
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,160
Why do we have emotion?

26
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,060
And then things about the
brain basis of emotions.

27
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,010
So we have a huge number of
words, by one count about 550

28
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,860
words, that describe the
feelings we have,

29
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,870
the emotions we have.

30
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,740
And there's a lot of overlap
conceptually among them, but

31
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,260
we have so many words because
we think that, we feel that

32
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,280
from our daily lives, the
feelings and emotions that we

33
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,950
have are such a big part of our
human existence, how we

34
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,640
relate to other people, how we
feel when we're by ourselves.

35
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,790
Emotions are just a big,
big part of how we

36
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,280
go about our lives.

37
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,090
And they're readily apparent
to us everywhere we look on

38
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,150
the faces of others.

39
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,210
Positive emotions, negative
emotions, fearful emotions,

40
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:13,740
you see them around
you all the time.

41
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,270
In psychology, a lot of ideas
about formulating the field go

42
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,190
back to William James, who
worked at Harvard, who

43
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:22,260
articulated in many ways, in
language that's still relevant

44
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,030
to this day, the basic ideas,
the basic things about being a

45
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,650
human that one wants to
understand out of a

46
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,840
psychology.

47
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,630
And he wrote about emotion this
way, "If you can conceive

48
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,430
of yourself suddenly stripped of
all the emotion with which

49
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,810
our world now inspires you, no
one portion of the universe

50
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,940
would have more important
characteristics beyond

51
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,460
another; and the whole character
of its things and

52
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,770
series of events would be
without significance,

53
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,960
character, expression, or
perspective." That what we

54
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,710
fear, what we desire, what
we enjoy, what we find

55
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,250
disgusting--

56
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,710
we'll talk a little bit about
disgust today-- that all those

57
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,950
things tell us what's important
and whether it's to

58
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,070
be avoided or approached,
enjoyed or loathed.

59
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,540
And so people have thought
about emotions.

60
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,740
You could pick a million
different cultural directions.

61
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,330
Here's a picture from
Greek philosophy.

62
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,670
But you could pick
practically every

63
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,770
culture around the world.

64
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,350
You can't be a human and
not think about the

65
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,560
feelings you have.

66
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,690
But kind of strikingly in terms
of research, for a very,

67
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:26,150
very long time compared to
language or thinking or many

68
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:30,640
topics, people didn't study
emotion because it seemed hard

69
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,060
to study scientifically.

70
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,210
And it's still harder to study
scientifically in many ways, I

71
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,480
think, than cognition.

72
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,220
But there's been tremendous
progress in bringing

73
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,760
scientific approaches to
understanding something about

74
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,860
emotions in you and I. And
like many things, it was

75
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,400
reinvigorated around the
Renaissance and the mystery of

76
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,000
Mona Lisa's smile.

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,460
And now there's entire journals
and conferences and

78
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,420
organizations of scientific
psychology

79
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,730
devoted to study emotion.

80
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,210
It's a big part of our lives.

81
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,310
You would think in the study of
the human mind and brain it

82
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,690
would be a big endeavor.

83
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:04,990
And it is now.

84
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:09,430
But that wouldn't have been
true even 20 years ago.

85
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,340
How might we define emotion
just to sort of have some

86
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:13,920
boundaries?

87
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,200
So we could say that emotions
are biologically-based

88
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,010
responses to situations
that are seen

89
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,579
as personally relevant.

90
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:21,709
They are shaped by learning and
usually involves changes

91
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,400
in peripheral physiology.

92
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,430
Your hands are trembling
or things like that.

93
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,700
Your heart is pounding.

94
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,170
Expressive behavior, the
intonation with which you

95
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:33,740
speak, the facial expression
that you

96
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,100
have or see in others.

97
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,650
And subjective experience.

98
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,690
The emotions you have go with
what you feel is going on

99
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,780
inside you.

100
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,280
Research has tried to
distinguish between moods and

101
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,700
emotions, and talk about moods
as diffuse, long-lasting

102
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,670
emotional states.

103
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:52,150
When you're in a funk or a
positive mood over days,

104
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,480
weeks, months, that's
not what we're going

105
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,250
to talk about today.

106
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,160
That's interesting and
important also.

107
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,640
We're going to talk about
emotions, which are very

108
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,110
punctate, immediate responses
to situations, to a specific

109
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:06,910
thing or a specific stress or
a specific element of your

110
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:11,420
environment, an immediate,
strong response.

111
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,450
And within that, one more
distinction has turned out to

112
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,050
be useful for thinking about
emotions between two

113
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,920
dimensions, arousal, or
you could call it

114
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,670
intensity, and valence.

115
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,200
Arousal means things that are
exciting, intense, if they're

116
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,870
high arousal, or calm
or lethargic

117
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,320
if they're low arousal.

118
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,840
Valence refers to whether it's
a positive thing that makes

119
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,500
you elated or contented,
negative sad or gloomy.

120
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,060
And you can already
see, for example,

121
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,720
take positive valence.

122
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,150
Elated is high arousal.

123
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,220
Contented, ah, that's
low arousal.

124
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,900
They're both positive, but
they're kind of different.

125
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,790
So is calm versus lethargic.

126
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,520
Being calm can be
sometimes good.

127
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,150
Feeling really slow, really
lethargic, also is low

128
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,570
arousal, but it's usually not
a desirable low arousal.

129
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,580
And so people think that they
can take basically these two

130
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,850
dimensions, valence and arousal,
and use it as a

131
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:06,080
useful way to say something
like calm is here.

132
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,970
It's a little bit positive
and it's low

133
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,550
on the arousal dimension.

134
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,690
Excited is up here.

135
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,070
It's a positive valence.

136
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:18,020
Different things, gloomy is
negative and it's fairly

137
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,280
intense feeling, as opposed
to merely lethargic.

138
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,170
These two dimensions can cover
a big sense of the life of

139
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:28,610
emotions that inhabit us.

140
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,430
And a huge question, and one
that's brutally hard to

141
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,865
satisfy in some deep scientific
way, of course, is

142
00:06:33,865 --> 00:06:35,540
it restricted to humans?

143
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:40,110
So if you hang around pets
and animals in various

144
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,660
circumstances, you can't help
but feel they have emotions.

145
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,890
It's just very hard for us
to ask them to fill out

146
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,900
questionnaires telling
us their emotions.

147
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,250
Here's a chimp that has lost
its mother recently.

148
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,660

149
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,034
Here's a dog going out
for a good old night.

150
00:06:57,034 --> 00:06:59,330
Here's an armadillo
going, whee!

151
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:02,520
It looks pretty aroused.

152
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,480
We don't know how much of this
in some cases is us reading

153
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,060
human feelings into their
expressions, how much of that

154
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,200
is them feeling the
same as we do.

155
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,650
There's a lot of sense,
obviously, that many species

156
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:15,990
have feelings as
well as humans.

157
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,810
We'll focus just on
humans today.

158
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,140
And the other thing that's
important is

159
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,020
they're shaped by learning.

160
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,450
What that means is many
different things, but for

161
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:27,210
example, they can vary from
one culture to another in

162
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,200
certain ways.

163
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,520
And here's one example of a
movie that's bringing tears to

164
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,270
everybody's eyes, except
this person who

165
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:38,380
finds it utterly hilarious.

166
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,870
If you work in emotion
research, I can

167
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,750
tell you you get that.

168
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,880
I worked a little bit on that.

169
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,420
You show some really horrible
pictures to everybody.

170
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,910
They go, oh, horrible,
horrible, horrible.

171
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,190
And somebody else
starts laughing.

172
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:48,920
It's like horror movies.

173
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,540
Have you've been around horror
movies where some people are

174
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,800
really scared out of their seats
and very worried about

175
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,010
the characters and other
people think

176
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,110
it's all pretty funny?

177
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,930
So that's your prospective.

178
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:02,730
It's not an automatic response
to many situations.

179
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,310
So how have people thought about
the emotion you feel

180
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,580
when a bear jumps out of your
closet unexpectedly?

181
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,720

182
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,540
Here's the logical one.

183
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,310
Common sense.

184
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,340
Bear is scary.

185
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,970
You feel fearful.

186
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,650
That's your subjective
experience.

187
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,460
And your body starts to
do things like your

188
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,770
heart starts to pump.

189
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:24,290
Your sweat glands start
to sweat, because

190
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,390
you go, this is dangerous.

191
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,110
This is scary.

192
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,100
Here comes my body.

193
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,370
That would be the
intuitive one.

194
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:31,770
My heart is pounding because
I feel afraid.

195
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:36,380
Interestingly, you can reverse
the order and find some things

196
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,780
that are better explained
that way.

197
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,480
It's sometimes nice, sometimes
people will say, oh my gosh.

198
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,659
Everything in psychology
is so obvious.

199
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,200
For some reason, they always
say, my grandmother

200
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,630
would have known it.

201
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,610
I don't know why they
pick that example.

202
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,650
Show us something that science
only can tell you.

203
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:54,060
So here's a very clever reversal
from William James

204
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,780
and also Lange.

205
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,730
They reversed it.

206
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,860
They said that first comes the
bodily response to the

207
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,210
situation and second comes your
mind interpreting your

208
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,790
body's primary response.

209
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:11,200
The exact opposite order of
why we feel as we do.

210
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,160
"We feel sorry because we cry,
angry because we strike,

211
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,570
afraid because we tremble, and
not that we strike, cry, or

212
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,660
tremble because we are sorry,
angry, or fearful." He sees

213
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,870
the exact opposite.

214
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,770
Here it says first comes an
emotion that's shaking your

215
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,560
body in some way, and then comes
to your mind saying,

216
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,030
aha, I'm afraid--

217
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,110
pretty fast--

218
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,840
or I'm happy or whatever.

219
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,150
Here's some examples, because
you could think, OK, yes, you

220
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,120
can cleverly reverse them.

221
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,570
But is there any science to
suggest that in some cases

222
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,490
that relationship
does reverse?

223
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,360
So here's what people did.

224
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,760
And I'll show you a
picture for this.

225
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,160
They said, how can peripheral
bodily events, things on sort

226
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,230
of the edge of our bodies,
influence the

227
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,270
emotions we feel inside?

228
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,710
So they would have people do
things like hold a pencil

229
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,630
tightly between their
teeth and--

230
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,530
look at that pencil.

231
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,830
They're not told to smile.

232
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,570
They're just told to keep
that pencil there.

233
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,100
And what does that look like?

234
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,040
A smile, right?

235
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,530
OK.

236
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:04,490
You've tricked the person's
face into smiling.

237
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,940
And they don't even know
that, necessarily.

238
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,720
They're thinking, this is a
weird psychology experiment

239
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,750
about how long can you hold a
pencil in your mouth, although

240
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,240
they're going to know something
more in a moment.

241
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,300
Or between the lips,
hold that pencil.

242
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,440
Now, does this person
look happy?

243
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:18,590
No.

244
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,910
A little bit not happy, right?

245
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,880
OK.

246
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,930
And then you have them watch a
funny movie that most people

247
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,250
find funny.

248
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,080
And they rate how much
they like it.

249
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:36,330
And the person who had this one
rates it as more enjoyable

250
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:39,630
than the person holding a pencil
this way, as if already

251
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:43,050
having the muscles in your face
moved into a position

252
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:47,190
that typically signals happiness
or laughter makes

253
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:51,860
you feel happy inside and the
funny movie is even funnier.

254
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,810
Being in a somewhat neutral to
negative position makes that

255
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:58,610
same funny movie seem
less funny.

256
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:02,380
You're interpreting where your
muscles are that normally go

257
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,360
with one emotion or another,
and that's driving your

258
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,640
internal final emotion about how
you feel about the movie.

259
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,274
Was there a question?

260
00:11:10,274 --> 00:11:10,574
AUDIENCE: Could it require more

261
00:11:10,574 --> 00:11:11,824
concentration, or patience?

262
00:11:11,824 --> 00:11:13,430

263
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,340
PROFESSOR: Does one require
more concentration?

264
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,820
That's an excellent question,
because we always like to say,

265
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,690
oh, it's this thing.

266
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,580
What if this is a harder
thing like that?

267
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,130
And so when one have to
hope-- and I have to

268
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,800
admit I don't know--

269
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,690
that they've controlled for
things like that in some way.

270
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:27,710
If you read the research paper,

271
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,390
you'd want to be concerned.

272
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,730
That's an excellent question.

273
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,680
If this is just harder work than
maybe you're paying less

274
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,750
attention to the movie and just
hanging onto that pencil.

275
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,730
I don't know.

276
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,360
And I have to hope they did
a good job on this.

277
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,390
That's an excellent question.

278
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,510
And here's other ones, again,
where they're trying to get

279
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:46,260
the face to go smiley
or go frowny.

280
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,040
And then they just ask them,
how do you feel?

281
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,810
And this person will rate
themselves as feeling happier

282
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,280
than this person as they answer
on a piece of paper in

283
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,020
front of them.

284
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,860
Again, they're trying to say, if
I can move your peripheral

285
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,010
facial expressions into--

286
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,260
your muscles into expressions,
the feelings will follow from

287
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,510
the expressions.

288
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,280

289
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,050
You can also do something else,
which is you can tell

290
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,130
people-- so Paul Ekman, his name
will come up a lot today.

291
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,510
He's done a fantastic amount of
the key research on this,

292
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,980
making emotions into a research
topic in many ways.

293
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,480
What he developed is a way that
he said, I'm going to

294
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,300
describe objectively which
muscles are in which position

295
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,800
for each of six fundamental
emotional expressions.

296
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,260
We'll come back to those.

297
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,500
So he would tell a person, raise
your eyebrows and pull

298
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,300
them together.

299
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,620
Raise your upper eyelids.

300
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,450
Now stretch your lips
horizontally back

301
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,430
towards your ears.

302
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,650
So what he's giving this person,
step by step, is

303
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:45,750
directions that move the muscles
into an expression of

304
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,040
fear, by the time you
end up there.

305
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,860
The participant usually doesn't
know that, because

306
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,340
it's so weird.

307
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,200
You're moving your mouth.

308
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,790
You're moving--

309
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,300
it's just so weird.

310
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,160
But then they can do these
kinds of experiments.

311
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,340
And these people will report a
fearful movie as being more

312
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,600
fearful than somebody who just
gets to sit there or whose

313
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,580
muscles are moved into
a happy position.

314
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,240
So all of a sudden you've got
all these peripheral things

315
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,770
being interpreted by our mind
as a signal for what emotion

316
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:13,140
you have, or enhancing
it anyway.

317
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,500
And then because any strong
theory usually turns out to be

318
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,980
not nearly complicated enough,
you get the wishy-washy middle

319
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,760
that probably covers more of
the truth, which is both

320
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,050
things are going on.

321
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,350
Both you're having a subjective
cognitive

322
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,810
interpretation of your
environment and a bodily

323
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,680
response, maybe more
in parallel than

324
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,860
one driving the other.

325
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,110
So again, how can peripheral
bodily

326
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:38,690
events influence emotions?

327
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,570
One idea that's floated around,
and probably true, is

328
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,540
that the perception or
thought, your mental

329
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,670
interpretation of your emotion
tells you the type of emotion.

330
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:50,980
so if a bear jumps out, you
can say, OK, I know

331
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,150
something's pretty intense.

332
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:55,050
And I can tell you right
away it's bad.

333
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,040
But if something wonderful
jumps out of your closet

334
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,140
unexpectedly, then you
go, oh my gosh.

335
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,460
I can't believe Lindsay Lohan
is visiting me and I didn't

336
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,170
even know it.

337
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:10,540
Then if that is considered
a good visit, that would

338
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,790
influence again, the
interpretation, but the

339
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,720
intensity might come from
the bodily parts.

340
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,440
How intense it is might
be signaled from that.

341
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,590
So here's a couple of ways
that people explore this.

342
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:23,700
Here's a study from years ago
from Schacter, where he

343
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,580
injected people with
adrenaline--

344
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:31,100
adrenaline is the neurohormone
that goes with high arousal,

345
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,440
it raises your heart rate--

346
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,440
or a placebo.

347
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,290
So he's directly taking the
chemical that we normally

348
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:40,560
produce under higher
arousal conditions.

349
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,780
And the first question you might
ask is, and you might be

350
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:46,890
curious about, if somebody gave
you a shot of adrenaline,

351
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:47,610
what would happen?

352
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:48,950
Would you like jump out
of your seat and run

353
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:49,910
laps around the room?

354
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,200
What would you do?

355
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,440
And surprisingly, all by
itself, not very much.

356
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,670
People said they feel a bit
jittery, like if you've had

357
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,730
maybe a little too much
coffee or Red Bull--

358
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,980
is that the current?--

359
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,500

360
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,570
that little jittery feeling.

361
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,260
But they're not like jumping
up and do jumping jacks and

362
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:10,380
one-armed push-ups and
stuff like that.

363
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,920
Now, having had the placebo or
the adrenaline injected into

364
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,950
you, and you don't know
that, they show you an

365
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,130
emotion-eliciting--

366
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,330
they'll show you a movie,
like a horror movie.

367
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:24,470
And the people who had the
adrenaline will report more

368
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,880
fear when they see the horror
movie, more anger when they

369
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,640
get insulted.

370
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,130
That's a fun experiment
when you insult them.

371
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,840
I'm sure the IRB, you have
to be pretty careful.

372
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,370
More laughter for a comedy.

373
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:40,860
Adrenaline seemed to amplify the
intensity of the emotion.

374
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,390
But the emotion was driven
by the situation.

375
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,150
Does that make sense?

376
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,770
OK?

377
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,680
But here's something quite
interesting about humans,

378
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,540
which is that if you told
them, we've given you

379
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,690
adrenaline and it usually
amplifies stuff, then it

380
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:53,850
disappeared.

381
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,200
Once the person knew that, they
could discount that in

382
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,690
their mind.

383
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:01,210
So it's not like adrenaline is
your master, and that I must

384
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,800
have twice as big a response.

385
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,650
Once you knew that was in the
picture, then the ratings went

386
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:08,300
back to placebo.

387
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,840
It's not that biology
is destiny.

388
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,080
But under normal circumstances,
it seems like

389
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,290
the adrenaline accentuates
the intensity.

390
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,170
So that would go with the
possibility that peripheral

391
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:20,630
stuff drives the intensity,
peripherally injected

392
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,720
adrenaline, and our mind's

393
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,550
interpretation drives the content.

394
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:30,760
Here's a sort of fun, slightly
sexist experiment that in the

395
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,100
end, I think, explains the
following phenomenon.

396
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,407
When you see famous movie stars
go into a movie set, on

397
00:16:36,407 --> 00:16:39,040
set, or whatever they call it,
you incredibly often hear

398
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,230
about romances occurring between
the leads, right?

399
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,370
And there's debates about what
this is just the press agent

400
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,500
selling their movie
or whatever.

401
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,200
But you hear that all
the time, right?

402
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:46,490
OK.

403
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,340
So I'm going to tell you
why that happens

404
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,290
when it really happens.

405
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,220
I can't really tell you that.

406
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,060
But I can tell you an
experiment that

407
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,300
might touch on that.

408
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,450
So here's the experiment.

409
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,120
This was done by Dutton
and Aron in

410
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,770
North Vancouver, Canada.

411
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,720
And they did the experiment in
an area where there were two

412
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,500
bridges not right next to each
other, pretty near each other.

413
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,170
One was a flimsy suspension
bridge, five feet wide,

414
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:11,200
swaying and wobbling 320
feet over jagged

415
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,880
boulders and river rapids.

416
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,750
So you have to imagine
Indiana Jones, OK?

417
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,960
And you come to this
bridge and you're

418
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,900
going, I don't know.

419
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,750
OK.

420
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,089
The other one, upstream, same
river, same Canadian district.

421
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:25,030
There's a steady, low,
broad bridge.

422
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,520
No problem at all.

423
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,670
You could drive your car
over that, no problem.

424
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,290
Two bridges over the
same waters, one

425
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:34,900
seeming scary, one not.

426
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,390
Then what they did is in the
middle of each bridge they

427
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,210
placed an attractive, in this
case female, confederate.

428
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,240
Maybe somebody's done the
reverse gender experiment.

429
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,560
I don't know.

430
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,110
Anyway, as men walk across the
bridge, they ask them to fill

431
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:51,230
out a questionnaire, some
boring questionnaire.

432
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,940
And they casually mentioned that
if that person, as they

433
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,670
finish the questionnaire, has
more questions, he can call

434
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,670
the woman providing the
questionnaire at home.

435
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:03,060
And she provides him
her home number.

436
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:07,290
And the measure that they have
is how many phone calls go

437
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:12,180
from the male subjects to the
female experimenter at home.

438
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,230
And they're betting that it's
not really scientific

439
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,880
curiosity that's driving a
lot of the phone calling.

440
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,550
But here's what they
actually find.

441
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:22,300
More males will call that female
at home if they were on

442
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,930
the dangerous bridge than
on the safe bridge.

443
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,220
That's the actual finding.

444
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:30,000
And the interpretation is this,
the dangerous bridge,

445
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,520
because of the true feeling of
danger, produces high arousal,

446
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,350
increased adrenalin.

447
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:38,980
And that's misinterpreted, if
you want to call it that, by

448
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,940
the male because he thinks now
he's super-attracted to that

449
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,910
woman because of the
swaying bridge.

450
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:50,770
Another reason to take somebody
you want to win over,

451
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:54,370
whatever the gender situation
is, a really scary roller

452
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:57,290
coaster ride is highly
recommended together with that

453
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:01,480
warm beverage, as long as it
doesn't spill on them.

454
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,550
I'm making you too powerful
to control people.

455
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,730

456
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,300
Again, the arousal of the bridge
has been misinterpreted

457
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,030
by that person as an intense
attraction to that woman.

458
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,230
And you could imagine making
movies are probably high

459
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:17,220
arousal exciting situations,
and that would promote

460
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,310
romantic relations and high
intense situations that might

461
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,030
not otherwise occur.

462
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:21,280
Yes?

463
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,140
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

464
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,990
They had to randomly assign
them to one bridge or the

465
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:28,290
other, you would hope.

466
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:30,140
I can tell you there's been a
bunch of other experiments

467
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,250
sort of like this.

468
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,300
This is the most what you could
call ecological, silly,

469
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,830
or sexist, you could figure.

470
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:38,470
But they all go with this idea
that if you're in a high

471
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,840
arousal situation, you sort of
move over that arousal into

472
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,070
whatever it is you're
encoding.

473
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,830
Does that make sense?

474
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,850
And in this case, because you're
creating an interaction

475
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,760
between a man and woman, it's
promoting this probability of

476
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,890
a sense of romance
in the male.

477
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:54,910
Is that OK?

478
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,130
But it could be any situation.

479
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,220
The arousal will make it-- if
it's something, it can make

480
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,210
you feel worse about it.

481
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

482
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:03,840

483
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,380
PROFESSOR: Ah.

484
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,650
Totally excellent question.

485
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:06,900
You're asking awesome
questions.

486
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,570

487
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,560
I have to assume-- and I should

488
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,590
know this, but I don't--

489
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,530
that they weren't.

490
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:18,120
Yes, because if you had males
self-selecting, you had some

491
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,710
males running to the danger
bridge, drawn to danger, and

492
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:24,060
others saying, oh, please give
me a safe road, is that the

493
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:24,370
real difference.

494
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,120
So you have to presume
they did something to

495
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,020
control that, yes.

496
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,270
Excellent question.

497
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:31,460

498
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,480
The current view is something
like that there's two factors,

499
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,820
that there's both.

500
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,060
A bodily response that happens
pretty fast, pretty

501
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,470
automatically, pretty
unconsciously.

502
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,030
There's a lot of
interpretation.

503
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,300
And the combination of that
bodily response and an

504
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,960
interpretation leads you finally
to the subjective

505
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,440
experience you have, and
probably works differently for

506
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,200
different emotions.

507
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,050
And things are complicated.

508
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:57,350
But we're pretty far from this
first guess in terms of the

509
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:00,920
fact that peripheral things can
have very powerful effects

510
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,730
on how you interpret situations,
the intensity of

511
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,910
your interpretations.

512
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:07,400
And the intensity itself can
change the behaviors that

513
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,580
follows the situation.

514
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,410
Three questions in the field
are, are emotions universal?

515
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,110
Are they in you from
when you're born?

516
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:17,010
Are they the same for people
around the world?

517
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,895
Do they have unique
physiological signatures?

518
00:21:18,895 --> 00:21:20,460
Could we define--

519
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,450
if we knew your heart rate, if
we knew your pulse and so on,

520
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,380
could we know what emotional
state you're in.

521
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,700
And then speculations as to why
we have emotions at all.

522
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,100
What's the use of
having emotions?

523
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,930
Brilliant as he is in so many
ways, in many ways this

524
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,930
dialogue began in modern times
with Charles Darwin, who

525
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:42,270
noticed that animals had very
striking facial expressions,

526
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,070
as we saw before.

527
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,260
And that made him think about
the evolution of facial

528
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,540
expressions.

529
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:51,360
This is one of his drawings
of a cat.

530
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,930
Here are infants having early
displays of emotions, joy,

531
00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:00,490
disgust, surprise, sadness,
anger, fear.

532
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:03,140
So people have been very
impressed that very early on

533
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,600
infants are having the full
array of expressions.

534
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,500
Of course, they might
see them.

535
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,410
From moments from their birth
they have people around them.

536
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:13,920
But it's very early, that's
almost for sure.

537
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,430
A really interesting line of
research-- and I'll show you

538
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,810
an example-- has been looking
at emotional expressions,

539
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:20,970
emotional facial expressions, in
people who are born deaf or

540
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:24,040
born blind, so they never
hear intonation.

541
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,150
They never see a facial
expression.

542
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:29,150
They can't learn it from
their environments.

543
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:34,493
So they're sort of a natural
window into is this inborn in

544
00:22:34,493 --> 00:22:37,520
us, or do we learn it from
people around us?

545
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,910
Here's an experiment where they
took spontaneous facial

546
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:43,970
expressions of emotion in
athletes from both the

547
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:45,670
Olympics and the Paralympics.

548
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,760
And they looked especially at
congenitally blind people,

549
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,760
born blind, never saw a face,
and sighted athletes.

550
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,630
And they looked at the
expressions after winning or

551
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:55,880
losing an Olympic-level match.

552
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,830
Before I show you this, you
may know the story.

553
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:02,860
What happens after
an Olympic event?

554
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,930
Somebody wins and where
do they go?

555
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,960
You know this podium thing?

556
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,030
The gold medal winners up here,
and the silvers here and

557
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,090
the bronzes here.

558
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,160
And they've also done
studies--this

559
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,880
is just a side note--

560
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,602
saying, who looks the happiest
in those pictures?

561
00:23:18,602 --> 00:23:19,460
AUDIENCE: Bronze.

562
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,960
PROFESSOR: The bronze
medal winner.

563
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,680
Who looks the saddest
in those pictures?

564
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,420
AUDIENCE: Silver.

565
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,430
PROFESSOR: The silver, right?

566
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:27,070
Because the bronze medal
winner's going, thank goodness

567
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,010
I came in third place.

568
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:28,700
I'm on the podium.

569
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,510
I have an Olympic medal.

570
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:32,720
If I'm in fourth place, fourth
through infinity gets the same

571
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,350
Olympic medal, right?

572
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,970
The silver medalist, what's
he or she thinking?

573
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,180
On average.

574
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:41,590
Man, if I had just one more
fraction of a millisecond, I

575
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:44,110
could be the gold medalist.

576
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,160
It's kind of an interesting
thing of when we consider

577
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,980
things satisfactory or not.

578
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,390
But now let's turn back
to this question.

579
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:55,600
Here's two people who just lost
Olympic medal matches.

580
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,770
And your question is which is a
sighted person and which is

581
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,820
a blind person?

582
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,560
And to the extent it's hard to
be certain, that would be a

583
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,350
big suggestion that these
expressions are inborn in us,

584
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:10,890
because a person who's never
seen a sad expression still

585
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:13,050
has a sad expression.

586
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:16,020
And the answer is, that's the
blind athlete and that's the

587
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,800
sighted athlete.

588
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,720
So it's pretty convincing, I
think, that we're born with

589
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,320
this set of expressions as a
core entity of being human.

590
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,780

591
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,630
Even though we're born with
that, we live in different

592
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,780
cultures, very different
cultures around the world, and

593
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,550
even within countries and
across countries.

594
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:37,470
So how universal are these
sorts of things?

595
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:41,870
And there's lots of evidence
of a degree of influence of

596
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:46,260
cultures around this
core universality.

597
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,720
So does a smile mean friendship
to everyone?

598
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,550
And again, Ekman and Izard made
a big study in which they

599
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,680
argued that as far as they can
tell in looking around at

600
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,690
facial expressions, there's
six basic emotional

601
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:03,860
expressions that signal
feelings, happiness, sadness,

602
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:08,070
fear, anger, surprise,
or disgust.

603
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:12,040
These are all people who are
trained to try to make the

604
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,300
perfect expression
of those things.

605
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,280
They look kind of weird
by themselves, right?

606
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,780
They look kind of weird.

607
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,240
You don't see a neutral
one here.

608
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,370
Maybe we'll see a neutral
one later.

609
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:22,380
Neutral is kind of weird,
because you

610
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,710
go, well, it's neutral.

611
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:27,310
But I can tell you, a totally
neutral face looking at you

612
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,680
can be kind of creepy.

613
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,630
Because if you interact with
somebody and they have no

614
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:34,210
expression at all, it's
a little disturbing.

615
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:39,320
But these are ones are pretty
universally recognized, but

616
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,410
not completely.

617
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:42,145
Let's take Westerners,
people from the

618
00:25:42,145 --> 00:25:45,150
United States or Europe.

619
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,100
We're not perfect in that.

620
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,070
Even with these posed pictures,
this is how often

621
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,530
people came up with the
correct labels.

622
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:53,040
Pretty often, not perfect.

623
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,100
There's a lot of mystery
at the edges of this.

624
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,310
But here's how people came up
from non-Western cultures for

625
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,830
the same Western faces.

626
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:03,670
Well above chance, but not the
same as Westerners looking at

627
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,300
Western expressions.

628
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,110
And it would reverse if
Westerners had to look at

629
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,080
non-Western expressions.

630
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,990
So there's definitely a degree
of cultural influences on the

631
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,560
recognition of these expressions
as well.

632
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,770
It's partly innate and
universal, and there's a

633
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:21,420
cultural overlay as well.

634
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,560
This is a joke.

635
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,370
"Shoot!

636
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:25,390
You've got not only the wrong
planet, but you've got the

637
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,240
wrong solar system.

638
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,500
I mean, a wrong planet
I can understand.

639
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,510
But a wrong solar system--" And
you can tell with just a

640
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:32,310
little information that this
is a sheepish smile of

641
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,310
embarrassment.

642
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,970
And this is a little bit of
the body expression of a

643
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,850
little bit of irksomeness.

644
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:39,760
Irked.

645
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,510
But here's an isolated
pre-literate

646
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,810
tribe in New Guinea.

647
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:48,220
And that smile looks like the
smile of any kid you ever saw.

648
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,735
That's sadness, the sadness
of any kid you every saw.

649
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:54,370
That's a little bit
of a disgust.

650
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:56,570
And some people have built up
a model, something like

651
00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:00,730
there's things in the
environment that happen that

652
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:04,560
drive some sort of facial
affect program.

653
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:08,760
Your muscles in your face move
to express 6 or so different

654
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,720
kinds of feelings.

655
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,210
Cultural rules about what should
you show, what should

656
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,180
you not show in different
cultures.

657
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:18,530
Some face's expressions are more
appreciated than others.

658
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:20,540
And finally, all of that
moves into the facial

659
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,570
expression you make.

660
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:26,290
So now the second question we
have, we think to a first

661
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:29,500
approximation emotions, at least
as far as we can tell,

662
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,590
are pretty universal but there's
cultural and learned

663
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,540
pieces as well.

664
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,460
Do emotions have unique
physiological signatures?

665
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,340
Can we tell from your

666
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,620
physiology what you're feeling?

667
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,830
And there was a lot of hope that
this would work, because

668
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:45,320
intuitively emotions differ
from one another.

669
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,790
Our body feels different
as we go from

670
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,300
one emotion to another.

671
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,330
And we use language words like
"she got hot and bothered."

672
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:56,550
"You make my blood boil." "He's
just letting off steam."

673
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,780
Different physiologies go
with different feelings.

674
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,300
And so people hoped they could
make decision trees like this.

675
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,150
Let's measure your heart
rate, high or low.

676
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:05,360
Well, if it's high, then we
get your skin temperature.

677
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,630
And then we can tell if you're
angry or fear or sad.

678
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:10,340
That you could make a decision
tree by looking at peripheral

679
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,950
measures of physiology.

680
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:14,150
But it never worked.

681
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,700
It's never been strongly
discriminating.

682
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,320
People have not been able
to have a physiological

683
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,030
fingerprint for the emotion
that you feel that's

684
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,210
reasonably accurate.

685
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:26,592
Yes?

686
00:28:26,592 --> 00:28:28,593
AUDIENCE: So why are they
[INAUDIBLE] as something that

687
00:28:28,593 --> 00:28:30,958
could go in that tree,
for instance?

688
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:33,190
Could they measure chemical
concentrations in places?

689
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:33,870
PROFESSOR: It's possible, yes.

690
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,180
Here's a very good question.

691
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,730
Here they're measuring
peripheral physiology or

692
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:40,030
autonomic systems, skin
temperature, heart rate.

693
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:42,580
Could there be other things
like chemicals, right?

694
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:46,720
So I'd say yes, but we just
don't know them well enough.

695
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,890
Or could you have brain measures
that ultimately would

696
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,010
be sophisticated enough?

697
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,390
I can tell you that brain
measures are not that

698
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,530
good at that now.

699
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,180
But could they be someday?

700
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:54,890
Yes.

701
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:59,210
So yes, it's the specific
measures that we have.

702
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:03,800
A really deep question will be
at some level when you're

703
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,960
fearful and I'm fearful, how
identical will those be,

704
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,070
depending on our cultural
background, depending on

705
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,500
situations we've experienced?

706
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,300
We can both agree we're scared
of something, but it could be

707
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,550
pretty different.

708
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,500

709
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,490
So it's a really
deep question.

710
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:21,650
In the end, how close are these
things from one person

711
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:22,850
to another?

712
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:28,620
Now, at least at speculative
is why we have emotions.

713
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:33,380
And sometimes people think
it's intrapersonal

714
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,240
functions within us.

715
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,920
We're organizing ourselves--
what's our basic feeling?

716
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,290
Are we basically happy or sad
about something or fearful of

717
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,240
something?--

718
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,960
so that we use that feeling as
a source of information to

719
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,630
sort of pull ourselves
to say, this is

720
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,800
basically where I'm at.

721
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,070
It's a source of information
for me.

722
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:51,760
And it can tell me what behavior
makes sense to do in

723
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,220
this context.

724
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,640
And then from one person to
another, interpersonally.

725
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,610
What does that person feel?

726
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,610
What am I signalling
to that person?

727
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:01,150
So here's an experiment.

728
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,890
And I'll show you just a brief
YouTube video on this, because

729
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:06,210
I think it's really cute.

730
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:08,380
But it's almost a life and death
experiment, although no

731
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,410
infant was harmed in the making
of this experiment.

732
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:15,270
So what they do is, this
is a visual cliff.

733
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,970
An infant is put on this,
a very tiny baby.

734
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:20,360
Here it's hard Plexiglas.

735
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:24,020
There is no danger
to the baby.

736
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,500
But there is a drop here
and a drop here.

737
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,890
Now, as the baby approaches
this, they're not used to the

738
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:31,120
idea of Plexiglas.

739
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,300
Even you and I would be pretty
worried about that if it was

740
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,700
on a larger scale.

741
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,260
We'd want to be pretty sure
about the strength of the

742
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,450
Plexiglas But to the infant's
eyes, they're approaching what

743
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:42,460
they call a visual cliff.

744
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,120
On the other side--

745
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,740
I'll show the film
in a moment--

746
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,450
is a mother.

747
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:50,030
And the mother can either be
showing a positive expression

748
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,070
or a negative expression.

749
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:54,960
And look what happens to the
infants in this perilous

750
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:01,940
situation where they see a drop
that's a big, and how

751
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:05,630
much they trust their mother's
expression to know what to do.

752
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:09,120
So if the mother is looking
happy, like it's OK.

753
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:09,880
This is going to be great.

754
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,100
We're having a lot of fun.

755
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,970
3/4 of the time the infant
goes for it.

756
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:17,510
If the mother looks
scary, never.

757
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:22,120
They're making kind of a
dangerous decision entirely on

758
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,750
the facial expression of the
mother and their trust that

759
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:27,050
the mother knows the right thing
to do and is giving them

760
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:28,300
the right advice.

761
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:35,740

762
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,820
Sometimes everything in
psychology can just seem like,

763
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,720
oh, it's just another thing.

764
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,030
But facial expressions are an
unbelievable powerful way that

765
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,280
we communicate with
one another.

766
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,050

767
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:51,660
Here's an extremely clever
experiment from Adam Anderson,

768
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,540
who happened to be a
postdoctoral fellow in my lab,

769
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:57,200
but he did this completely
independently.

770
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:57,970
Here's the question.

771
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,640
So we have some different
expressions.

772
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,390
And you could say, well, are
they completely random as to

773
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:05,310
what the actual expression is?

774
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,330
We haven't even asked this.

775
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,610
Why does a smile go one way and
a frown go the other way?

776
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:12,200
Does it mean anything or are
they just arbitrary signals of

777
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,820
different emotions that have
evolved over time?

778
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,385
And he's almost the first
person I know to

779
00:32:17,385 --> 00:32:18,600
even ask this question.

780
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,980
And he looked at two emotions
that we'll come back to in

781
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:28,540
just a little bit, fear,
and disgust.

782
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:31,830
And he thought, well, look, it's
kind of interesting what

783
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:32,660
fear and disgust do.

784
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:36,340
For example, fear, your eyes
get bigger, disgust--

785
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:41,770
think about something
really stinky--

786
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:42,580
you close your eyes.

787
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,490
You sort of scrunch
up your nose.

788
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:45,330
Look at this.

789
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:48,830
And he looked at and measured
how airflow patterns and

790
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:52,150
different things happen when you
go into those expressions,

791
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:56,610
non-arbitrary properties
of an expression.

792
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:58,100
And then he did psychological
expressions.

793
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,620
He got people to get into
these expressions.

794
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,560
And he found that if they were
in a fearful expression, that

795
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:08,490
they would feel like they had a
wider field of view, and if

796
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,820
it's disgust, a smaller.

797
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,720
Now think about this
for a moment.

798
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,020
When it's fearful, do you want
to feel like you know what's

799
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,390
going on around you?

800
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:21,210
Or do you want to sit back
and think about stuff?

801
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:22,880
Or do you want to
say like, uh-oh.

802
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,570
Where do I run?

803
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,020
What's going on?

804
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:29,480
When you go into some disgusting
situation, do you

805
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,020
want to really look
around a lot?

806
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:34,150
Or are you kind of happy to
find some way out of it?

807
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:36,420
Same thing with your nose.

808
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:40,390
Here's the air velocity that's
passing through your nose when

809
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:42,940
you're fearful and when
you're disgusted.

810
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,980
Now you don't even
think about that.

811
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,980
Who's thinking, I'm controlling
my air velocity?

812
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:51,420
But why do you think you might
want to really sample your

813
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:56,420
environment when you feel
danger, visually and in an

814
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:56,990
olfactory way?

815
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,240
Why do you think you might
want to sample?

816
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,450
Well, you want to know
what's going on.

817
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,690
You want the information
as fast as possible.

818
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:02,360
Do I run?

819
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,200
Do I duck?

820
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:03,890
What do I do?

821
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:04,960
Do I fight, flee?

822
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,605
What do I do?

823
00:34:05,605 --> 00:34:08,940
I have moments to decide,
because I'm in danger.

824
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,790
If you're in a disgust
situation, are you interested,

825
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:14,750
typically, in exploring the
olfactory environment in as

826
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:18,080
much detail as you can?

827
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,510
Usually not.

828
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,699
So it's kind of interesting.

829
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:21,372
The very first time --

830
00:34:21,372 --> 00:34:23,000
I know, it's very clever --

831
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,699
asked where do these expressions
come from?

832
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:28,940
Well, maybe they tend, to a
certain extent, to exaggerate

833
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:32,409
or diminish forms of sensory
input that are relevant for

834
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:35,159
the emotion.

835
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:37,500
So for the last little bit I'm
going to talk about for a

836
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,360
little while what we know
about the brain

837
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,550
basis of some emotions.

838
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:43,290
We already talked about the idea
that the amygdala plays a

839
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,210
special role in fear.

840
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:45,659
And I'll show you a couple
different ways in

841
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:46,929
which that's true.

842
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:49,949
This is just sitting in front of
the hippocampus, one on the

843
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:51,760
left, one on the right,
the core elements

844
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,889
of your limbic system.

845
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:55,820
Here it is viewed from the
side, the amygdala.

846
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:58,720

847
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,520
Here's the actual amygdala
from a post-mortem brain.

848
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,890
And there's another whole level
of analysis that animal

849
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:08,140
researchers do that we can't
touch today, which is the

850
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:11,670
amygdala itself is made out of
bundles of neurons called

851
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:14,300
nuclei, very distinct ones that
have different roles,

852
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,140
different inputs, different
outputs.

853
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:19,940
And in animal research, where
you can selectively influence

854
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,180
one or the other, you can see
they have quite different

855
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,070
specific roles.

856
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:26,500
In humans we don't have that
precision of control, so we

857
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,740
sort of have some clump average

858
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,530
statements about the amygdala.

859
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:33,350
But really we're mixing together
a few functions.

860
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:37,200
So you already saw this picture,
that animals, mice or

861
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,050
rats, that have an amygdala
removed lose the fear they

862
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:41,395
ought to have of a cat.

863
00:35:41,395 --> 00:35:44,640

864
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,570
In primate studies, they found
that if they have amygdala

865
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:50,610
lesions, the loss of threat
appreciation impairs social

866
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:52,460
fitness, that animals that don't
know what they ought to

867
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:55,730
be afraid of get into
big trouble.

868
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:58,560
They lose their position in
dominance hierarchies.

869
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,830
You may know primate groups
tend to have dominance

870
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:03,170
hierarchies, a sort of
alpha male and so on.

871
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:05,800
They slide down that.

872
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,360
If they lesion the dominant
male, the alpha male, the male

873
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,930
who wins all the fights and
controls the group, that

874
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:13,850
animal will fall down the
hierarchy and become

875
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:15,690
subordinate.

876
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:18,130
And in the wild, they've shown
that if they do lesions and

877
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,930
return the animal to the social
situation, they get

878
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:22,980
rejected by the other animals,
because the other animals feel

879
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,300
there's something weird
about the animals.

880
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,840
And they're often isolated and
they get to early death,

881
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,210
because the other animals
are not helping them

882
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:29,550
or supporting them.

883
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:33,400
So very important for learning
what's dangerous.

884
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,130
Here's an experiment with rhesus
monkeys lesioned at two

885
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:38,660
weeks as infants, returned to
their mothers, and tested at

886
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,660
eight weeks.

887
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:43,130
And here's an example of
something, this is if you show

888
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:45,310
an animal a novel object.

889
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:47,950
And this is how often
they respond to it.

890
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:52,590
Young animals will often not
explore it, because they go,

891
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,050
well, I don't know.

892
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,560
That could be dangerous.

893
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,090
They're waiting for their
mother's expression.

894
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,420
Here's the other animals with
the amygdala lesions.

895
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,800
They'll explore it.

896
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,090
In a sense, they're fearless.

897
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:05,820
But that's probably not an ideal
thing to do when you're

898
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,880
an infant exploring the world.

899
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:17,350
Or they'll put food only or
food next to a play snake.

900
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:19,460
Snakes are dangerous
for monkeys.

901
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:22,360
They usually don't want to
figure out at this age is it a

902
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,480
play snake or a real snake?

903
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,480
They just say, I don't really
need to eat that.

904
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,400
So everybody likes the food.

905
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,070
Put the snake next to it, and
the control animals go, no, I

906
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:34,800
don't think so, basically.

907
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,520
The amygdala ones, what's
for dinner?

908
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,260
And the answer is, if it's a
real snake, you're for dinner.

909
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,180
So they lose the fear of things
they ought to have fear

910
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:47,700
of, they lose fear of unknown
things, fear of things they

911
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,190
ought to be afraid of.

912
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,290
So the amygdala plays this
really important role.

913
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:55,180
Fear sometimes is maybe the
best understood emotion in

914
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:58,430
terms of brain processes, and
maybe the most studied, partly

915
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,130
because we've had some success
in understanding what's going

916
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:03,080
on and partly because fear is
maybe the emotion that most

917
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,780
people think is closer
to survival.

918
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,110
You fear what kills you.

919
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,510
You fear what pains you.

920
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:12,640
That's a very powerful emotion
for survival and safety.

921
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,310
And you can do fear
conditioning.

922
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:17,510
We talked about conditioning
before in all species, from

923
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:22,050
humans to primates, other
mammals, fruit flies.

924
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:26,310
All of them have, to a first
approximation, similar fear

925
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:26,890
conditioning.

926
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:30,220
It's as if you're alive, you
have to fear things that are

927
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,960
scary and dangerous.

928
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,680
So people have done fear
conditioning experiments.

929
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,370
And now you know
this very well.

930
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:39,090
You might hear a tone that's
not scary at first.

931
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:41,780
If you put it with something
that you don't like, like a

932
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,590
foot shock, you get fearful
to the tone.

933
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:47,340
And what people have discovered
kind of remarkably

934
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,920
is that you can make lesions in
many parts of the brain and

935
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,880
you don't affect that learned
fearfulness to the tone.

936
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,940
But if you make a damage in the
part of the amygdala, you

937
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,940
abolish that learning.

938
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:03,500
These animals fail to learn the
signal of something that

939
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,050
is coming up to be painful
and dangerous.

940
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:08,700
And you can even make large
lesions in the cortex.

941
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,490
That doesn't affect anything.

942
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:12,740
And these animals with the
amygdala lesions, they have an

943
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,690
intact unconditioned response.

944
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:17,930
When they get the shock, they
jump like the other animals.

945
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:18,910
They don't like it.

946
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:21,340
It's not that they
can't feel pain.

947
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:25,260
They can't learn that the tone
predicts the painful stimulus.

948
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,270
They can't learn the warning
signal of danger.

949
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:30,180

950
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,610
There's very few patients with
amygdala injuries only.

951
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:34,730
But there's a few.

952
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:36,960
So here's a patient, SM, who's
been studied by Damasio and

953
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,420
his colleagues.

954
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,410
This is where the amygdala
ought to be.

955
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:43,870
It's a developmental disorder
where this is calcified very

956
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:44,820
early in development.

957
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,870
It's not an adult lesion.

958
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:47,200
But it seems to be fairly
amygdala-specific.

959
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,150

960
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,050
And people have done
a couple of

961
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:52,320
experiments with these patients.

962
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,580
And it's sort of guided our
understanding of what the

963
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:58,240
amygdala does in you and I.
Here's one example where they

964
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,230
did conditioning.

965
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,340
Again, in this case they
didn't use shocks.

966
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:04,560
They used a super-loud
boat horn that's

967
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,840
pretty noxious to people.

968
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,120
People don't like it.

969
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,580
And they preceded that with
something gentle that warned

970
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:12,190
you it was coming.

971
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,360
Here's the initial response.

972
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,130
And here's the important
thing.

973
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:16,390
With humans, of course
you can--

974
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:20,200
well, let me just say they
managed a skin response, a

975
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,530
galvanic skin response
to the bad tones.

976
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:29,750
So here's the conditioned
stimulus, the response to the

977
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:32,590
boat horns in the conditioning,
what predicts

978
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:33,760
the boat horns.

979
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,460
Here's the response
to the baseline.

980
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:41,080
And here's the performance of
patients with amnesia who have

981
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,250
the amygdala--

982
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:45,770
controls, I'm sorry, who both
can tell you they're

983
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:48,630
responding selectively to the
scariest tones and also

984
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,080
remember perfectly well.

985
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,570
At the end of the testing
session, you go, what went on?

986
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:54,720
And they say, oh yes.

987
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,980
Well, when I got one signal I
got a horrible boat horn.

988
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,720
And when I heard the other
signal, I got nothing.

989
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,920
It's easy.

990
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,560
You do that for half an hour.

991
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,280
You get one visual signal that
means boat horn coming up, one

992
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,540
visual signal, nothing
coming up.

993
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,670
If you have patients who have
amygdala lesions, that

994
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:11,180
galvanic skin response doesn't
happen, even though they tell

995
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,470
you perfectly well afterwards
what happened.

996
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:16,440
So they know just like everybody
else that they got a

997
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,840
certain signal that went with
a noxious boat horn.

998
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,930
But their body is not learning
that association.

999
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:27,780
If a patient has hippocampal
damage, their body learns that

1000
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,960
association, but they don't
remember it afterwards

1001
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,490
consciously.

1002
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,540
So you can separate out two
kinds of learning, a

1003
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:38,080
hippocampal-dependent learning
of the facts of the session,

1004
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,700
and an amygdala-dependent
learning, which is a bodily

1005
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,380
response to learning that
something is dangerous and

1006
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,630
unpleasant.

1007
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,360

1008
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,510
Now, we often learn things like
the visual cliff without

1009
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:52,370
having to have a boat horn
and practice, right?

1010
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:54,850
If somebody tells you that
something is dangerous, or you

1011
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:57,760
figure out that something is
dangerous, you don't have to

1012
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,870
go through a terrible experience
to pretty much

1013
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:02,550
decide you're not
going to do it.

1014
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:08,450
So here's an experiment that was
aimed at showing you that.

1015
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:11,240
What people were shown-- there's
a funny human subjects

1016
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,330
wrinkle to this I'll
just tell you.

1017
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:14,320
This occurred at Yale,
where they had a

1018
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,500
blue square came on.

1019
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,310
That means safe.

1020
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:17,360
You can just relax.

1021
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,410
Nothing bad's going to happen.

1022
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:21,850
But when the yellow square
comes on, get ready.

1023
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:25,170
You might get a somewhat
unpleasant shock.

1024
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:29,270
But they never give
them a shock.

1025
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:31,180
So you're not learning
that way.

1026
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:33,670
You just factually learn that
something is safe and

1027
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:35,120
something is dangerous.

1028
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,960
And here is the amygdala
response to the scary one, to

1029
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,120
a neutral situation, and
to the one where you

1030
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,930
know, ah, I'm safe.

1031
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:45,640
So you never got the shock.

1032
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,030
You never got the shock.

1033
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,890
You were just told
about the shock.

1034
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:50,650
You didn't have to get
it, but you're human.

1035
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:51,840
You can figure this out.

1036
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,060
And your amygdala is going, you
know, I can just figure

1037
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,700
out that's dangerous.

1038
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,040
That's baseline.

1039
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,610
And that's the absence of
danger, positive safety.

1040
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:03,500

1041
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:07,770
The Yale IRB, hilariously I
think, said, oh, but you're

1042
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:10,210
deceiving the people, because
you tell them they might get a

1043
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:11,500
shock and they never
got a shock.

1044
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,410
So you have to give them one
shock at the end of the

1045
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:15,780
experiment.

1046
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,370
So dutifully, the experimenters
gave them one

1047
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:20,390
shock after the experiment was
over so they were honest.

1048
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:22,890
Because during the experiment,
as they measured the brain

1049
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:26,440
activation in the amygdala
responding to the threat of

1050
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,050
pain without any pain
being associated--

1051
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:29,560
we're smart.

1052
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,560
We can learn something is
dangerous just by thinking it

1053
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,440
through, and it engages the same
part of the brain that

1054
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:38,300
learns by actual painful
experience.

1055
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,210
Now how about memory?

1056
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:43,580
So here's the way this
study was done.

1057
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,210
People viewed a slide
story with an

1058
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:46,360
emotional middle section.

1059
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,550
So an example would be this,
parents are home having

1060
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:52,580
breakfast with a kid.

1061
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:53,540
Parents go to work.

1062
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:57,050
Kid walks to school, kind of
tragically, but these are all

1063
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:58,940
slides, again, nobody
was injured,

1064
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,640
child is hit by a car.

1065
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,120
Something high arousing
happens in the

1066
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,140
middle of the story.

1067
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,290
Everybody runs to
the hospital.

1068
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:06,290
The kid is OK.

1069
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:09,580
When people ask a week later or
something like that, a week

1070
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,960
later, tell me about the stories
I told you last week.

1071
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,220
There's a number of stories.

1072
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:17,130
People have best memory for
the part where something

1073
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:19,660
highly arousing happened, like
the child was hit by a car.

1074
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,115
That makes sense, right?

1075
00:44:21,115 --> 00:44:22,510
Kid having breakfast, huh.

1076
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:24,190
Kid OK, huh.

1077
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:26,450
Car accident with a kid,
you're aroused and you

1078
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:27,540
remember that better.

1079
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,750
Emotion is amplifying memory.

1080
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:34,000
The patients with the amygdala
lesions don't have that memory

1081
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,290
bump based on emotion.

1082
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:39,050
The emotion is not enhancing
their memory.

1083
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:41,310
And you can imagine that there's
a pretty good reason

1084
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:43,900
for emotions to enhance
memory, right?

1085
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:48,070
If something is fearful,
delightful, horribly

1086
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:51,640
disgusting, those are all good
reasons to remember.

1087
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,510
Let's do that again,
if it's great.

1088
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:56,060
Let's avoid that, if
it's terrible.

1089
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:59,100
It's a good idea for emotions
to drive memory formation.

1090
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:02,270
And in your brain and mine, it
appears the amygdala has this

1091
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:05,845
role of transforming emotions
into memories.

1092
00:45:05,845 --> 00:45:09,950

1093
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:13,370
Now we also talked about
six facial expressions.

1094
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:14,470
And I showed you this before.

1095
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:18,380
The same patients have trouble
in recognizing fearful facial

1096
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:18,880
expressions.

1097
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,720
So the amygdala in so many
different ways, learning,

1098
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:27,510
memory, perception of faces,
seems to play this

1099
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:29,490
huge role in fear.

1100
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:32,240

1101
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,710
And kind of interesting way,
because you might have the

1102
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:36,370
intuition--

1103
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:40,050
and a lot of this came
from Freud--

1104
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:42,800
that a lot of emotions are
happening kind of under our

1105
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,390
conscious awareness.

1106
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:47,180
We almost discover them after,
like why am I angry with this

1107
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:48,520
person, or why am I so happy?

1108
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,790
We have to think it
through, almost.

1109
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:53,940
If you show subliminal fearful
faces versus happy faces,

1110
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:58,190
subliminally presented so people
can't tell you what the

1111
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:02,330
facial expression was, still
they turn on the amygdala.

1112
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:05,330
So unconscious perception
of a fearful

1113
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:06,790
face engages the amygdala.

1114
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:09,400
You don't have to go through
consciousness.

1115
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,880
Cortical blindness.

1116
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,475
We talked about that earlier
in the course, where you're

1117
00:46:12,475 --> 00:46:14,715
blind in one visual field.

1118
00:46:14,715 --> 00:46:17,660
And yet individual patients, a
couple of them with cortical

1119
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:20,460
blindness, if they were shown
a fearful stimulus in the

1120
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:23,990
cortically blind field, still
turn on, in the cortically

1121
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:27,910
blind field, the amygdala for a
fearful face versus a happy

1122
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:32,250
face, which indicates that a
non-conscious, subcortical

1123
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:36,720
pathway that doesn't intersect
with conscious thought or

1124
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,000
cortex, is sending information
from your eyes to your

1125
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,020
amygdala, a different pathway.

1126
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:47,270
And people have speculated that
maybe again because fear

1127
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:50,580
is survival and danger, we might
have a super-highway of

1128
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:53,180
information that sends
dangerous information

1129
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:54,550
immediately to our amygdala.

1130
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:57,370
It doesn't wait for you to think
a lot, so to speak, in

1131
00:46:57,370 --> 00:46:58,200
your cortex.

1132
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,680
Boom.

1133
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,720
Danger, danger, danger, even
before you process the rest of

1134
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,570
the situation.

1135
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:07,840
So we talked about fear and the
threat in the amygdala.

1136
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,430
I'll just say a word
about disgust.

1137
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:13,750
People think there's many
reasons things we can be

1138
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:16,650
disgusted at or about, but
that maybe in terms of

1139
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:18,680
evolution, it might have been
a pretty good signal for

1140
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:22,750
contaminated food, food that
makes you sick, things to

1141
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:24,380
avoid that make you sick.

1142
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:27,300
And it turns out another part of
the brain called the insula

1143
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:30,100
is pretty important for that.

1144
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,030
So here's the amygdala
left and right.

1145
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:33,850
Here's the insula that
you have, left and

1146
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:36,470
right, outlined in purple.

1147
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:40,320
And again, just like with the
amygdala, patients with

1148
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:43,790
lesions of the insula don't
recognize facial expressions.

1149
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:46,790
And imaging wise, if you see a
disgusted face, that turns on

1150
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:48,210
that part of the
brain as well.

1151
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:52,000
So those are the best understood
brain pieces of

1152
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,990
emotion by far.

1153
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:56,120
So now those are patient things,
so let me turn for a

1154
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,540
moment, lastly to a few imaging
studies of typical

1155
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:02,290
people and some topics
on emotion.

1156
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:06,260
So here's some terrible
pictures from 9/11.

1157
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,240
"The horror of the moment"--
and we always

1158
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,290
imagine we'll remember--

1159
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:10,610
and we've already talked a
little bit about this in

1160
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:11,740
flashbulb memories--

1161
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:14,110
emotionally things correctly
for a long time.

1162
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:15,530
"'The horrors of that moment,'
the King went on, 'I shall

1163
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:17,020
never forget.'" This
is Lewis Carroll,

1164
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,180
Through the Looking Glass.

1165
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:19,910
"'You will though,' the Queen
said, 'if you don't make a

1166
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:20,720
memorandum of it.'"

1167
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,470
And now you know that Lewis
Carroll was talking about the

1168
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:23,760
amygdala, right?

1169
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,600
You didn't know that before,
but you know that now.

1170
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,830
Because if the amygdala isn't
there, the emotional intensity

1171
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:33,660
doesn't make the memory more
permanent or more powerful.

1172
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:37,040
So Larry Cahill at UC Irvine did
the first brain study on

1173
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:37,990
this topic.

1174
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:41,280
And what he did is he showed
students while they were

1175
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:46,800
getting PET scanning, Positron
Emission Tomography, short

1176
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,450
films that were either
powerfully

1177
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:51,480
emotional or neutral.

1178
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:54,280
And then he brought them
back three weeks later.

1179
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,200
And here's what he found.

1180
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,830
The more activation there
was in the amygdala--

1181
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:01,040
each square here is a
different person--

1182
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,350
the more they remembered
the emotional stuff.

1183
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:06,110
But it didn't matter
for neutral things.

1184
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,820
So the amygdala seems
unimportant for neutral

1185
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:10,380
information, but the more it
was engaged, the more they

1186
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,690
remembered emotional
information.

1187
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:14,750
So this is sort of evidence in
the typical human mind of a

1188
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:17,090
relationship between
the amygdala

1189
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:18,750
and emotional memories.

1190
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:23,200
So here's an experiment actually
that we did at

1191
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,540
Stanford, where we showed
people stimuli that were

1192
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:28,640
either neutral, somewhat
negative-- and I'm going to

1193
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,170
show you something that's
very negative.

1194
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:32,010
If you don't want to look, close
your eyes for a moment.

1195
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:32,310
Close your eyes.

1196
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:33,200
Here we go.

1197
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:33,840
Very negative.

1198
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:34,660
OK.

1199
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:37,390
Sorry.

1200
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:39,220
It turns out if we don't show
you something that negative,

1201
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:41,200
it's hard to get your
brain pumped up.

1202
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,330
It doesn't have to be
that sad, but it has

1203
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:45,330
to be pretty intense.

1204
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:46,680
So we show you things
like this.

1205
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:51,110
And we record your brain
response for each of those.

1206
00:49:51,110 --> 00:49:52,590
And here's what we do.

1207
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:54,450
We ask you to tell us
how bad is this?

1208
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:59,420
So the baby picture was
bad for most people.

1209
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:02,580
We wait three weeks, pretty long
time, and then we test

1210
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:05,310
your memory for the scenes
from before.

1211
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:08,190
We test your memory three weeks
later, pretty long time.

1212
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:09,050
And here's what we see.

1213
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:10,890
Two things.

1214
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:14,520
In the left amygdala in this
study, here's what you rated

1215
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:18,080
as terrible, pretty bad,
somewhat bad, and neutral.

1216
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:23,650
So the amygdala is responding
to your subjective sense of

1217
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:24,390
terribleness.

1218
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:27,470
Now, we were really looking
at arousal and negativity.

1219
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:30,040
We didn't look at
positive ones.

1220
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,550
I can tell you in
other studies--

1221
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:33,360
and here's a trick
in research.

1222
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,280
I'm going to tell you now--

1223
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,452
I only have a couple more
slides, but I'm going to tell

1224
00:50:36,452 --> 00:50:38,660
you a little bit about insider
things on imaging, just so you

1225
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:41,660
understand imaging as as human
and fallible a form of

1226
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:43,860
research as anything, which
you might suspect anyway.

1227
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:49,400

1228
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,555
So we show these things.

1229
00:50:51,555 --> 00:50:54,000
And we got these responses.

1230
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,180
So that's going with your
subjective sense of

1231
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:58,050
how bad films are.

1232
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:01,690
And then we tested people's
memory, what we also found was

1233
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:03,380
that memory was best
when we got the

1234
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,495
biggest amygdala response.

1235
00:51:04,495 --> 00:51:06,870
So that's just like
you heard before.

1236
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:11,240
So that all seemed find and
lined up with a prior result.

1237
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,950
But here was the slight surprise
in the thing that

1238
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:17,210
followed and that still gets
cited fairly often.

1239
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:18,790
It's the research that I've
been affiliated with that

1240
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:22,820
still gets cited most often in
newspapers and magazines.

1241
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:24,830
Anyway, so this was a study
that you saw before.

1242
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:26,670
And the thing I didn't emphasize
to you was that this

1243
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:28,695
was in the right amygdala,
in the right hemisphere.

1244
00:51:28,695 --> 00:51:29,800
It doesn't really matter.

1245
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,690
It just happened to be there.

1246
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:34,450
Our study at Stanford was
in the left hemisphere.

1247
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:37,770
This is where we were getting
the emotion memory responses.

1248
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:41,410
And so we were very
deep scientists.

1249
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:43,750
And we said, what could
be going on?

1250
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:46,820
Why is Larry Cahill at
UC Irvine getting

1251
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:48,890
it in the left amygdala?

1252
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:50,740
The more active it is, the
more you would remember

1253
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:51,570
emotional information.

1254
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:54,690
And why is he getting it in the
right amygdala and we're

1255
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:56,700
getting it in the left?

1256
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,110
So we took a piece of paper
and we wrote down the

1257
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:00,720
different things that
people had found.

1258
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,040
Oh.

1259
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,400
The story I was going
to tell you is about

1260
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,360
Stephan Hamann's study.

1261
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,650
So Stephan Hamann at Emory did
a study where he said, OK.

1262
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:08,940
All this amygdala response to
negative things, does it also

1263
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:11,360
respond to positive things?

1264
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,590
That's a good question.

1265
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:14,820
And the answer is yes.

1266
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:17,110
But it turns out in many
experiments it doesn't look

1267
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:19,910
that way, because you saw, for
those of you who looked at

1268
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:22,270
that horrible-looking baby
picture, what would be an

1269
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:27,190
equal positive powerful
picture?

1270
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:27,920
Let's try this one.

1271
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,510
Everybody agrees it's cute when
there's little children

1272
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:32,600
around a birthday cake.

1273
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,290
Smile, she smiles.

1274
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:38,230
Powerful, unless it's
your kid, maybe.

1275
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:40,730
Powerful image.

1276
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:42,170
Powerful as the face
of the infant?

1277
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:42,840
No.

1278
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,870
So it's a really interesting
thing.

1279
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:49,310
It's very hard to get positive
stimuli that are as potent as

1280
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:50,490
negative stimuli.

1281
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:52,900
You can get a million negative
stimuli from the internet and

1282
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,530
it's very hard to get
very positive ones.

1283
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:57,560
Having said that, we said, let's
just think about the

1284
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,810
negative ones for the moment.

1285
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:02,390
So our studies were
fMRI, PET, PET.

1286
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:04,260
Ours were all with women.

1287
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:05,640
And these were all with men.

1288
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,120
And you could go, well,
why did that happen?

1289
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:09,410
It's good that it's half women
and half men, because these

1290
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:12,160
were Positron Emission
Tomography.

1291
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:15,060
That involves injecting
radioactive stuff into people

1292
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,580
to do that kind of imaging.

1293
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:20,420
And many IRBs say, well, let's
not have women do it, because

1294
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:22,350
they could be unknowingly
pregnant.

1295
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:23,710
They could be.

1296
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:25,840
And we shouldn't be giving
radioactive stuff just for an

1297
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,250
experiment.

1298
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:29,410
You could have debates about
that, but that's the thought.

1299
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:31,380
Why not let the men get their
radioactive stuff?

1300
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:34,940
We don't really need them.

1301
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:36,980
Then so when we did this study,
we said, well, these

1302
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:37,640
were all with men.

1303
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,620
It seems in fairness we should
do it with women too.

1304
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:41,770
We just thought that seemed
fair, kind of.

1305
00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:44,030
We didn't have any big
thought about that.

1306
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:46,940
And again, we were getting left
amygdala and they were

1307
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:48,020
getting right amygdala.

1308
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:50,060
Pictures or films, different.

1309
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,430
And this caught our eye,
that we had done

1310
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:53,260
studies with women.

1311
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:54,150
We were getting left amygdala.

1312
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:56,040
They did it with men,
with right amygdala.

1313
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,820
So deep scientists that we were,
Larry Cahill said, I'll

1314
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:00,420
test men and women.

1315
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:01,750
And we said, we'll test
men and women.

1316
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:02,950
And here's what we found.

1317
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:05,780
And these are averages, but
one critical thing that we

1318
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:08,960
discovered-- we didn't know
this-- is that to the extent--

1319
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,070
and these are averages, of
course these are averages--

1320
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:15,270
that you compare men and women,
on average women have

1321
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:19,200
better memory for emotional life
events, faster production

1322
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,210
of autobiographical memories
to cues, more accurate in

1323
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:22,800
dating memories.

1324
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,720
So these dating studies are
pretty useful, because you

1325
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,400
never know how accurate a person
is when they have a

1326
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,620
memory for something.

1327
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:31,050
What they do in the dating
studies is they have people

1328
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:33,460
who are dating keep
diaries, for

1329
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:35,340
example, in the fall semester.

1330
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:36,960
And presumably those are
reasonably accurate.

1331
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,050
They're filling them
in every day.

1332
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:42,130
And then things happen over the
holidays and some people

1333
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:43,960
remain dating and some don't.

1334
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,890
So you go back to them in March,
and you go, in your

1335
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:49,480
fall, when the two of you were
going out, tell us about what

1336
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,400
you did in November.

1337
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,850
And they can say who's
more accurate.

1338
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:55,480
And they have almost a virtual
record, because they have the

1339
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:58,500
responses that the men and
women put down that day.

1340
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,080
And on average-- these
are averages-- the

1341
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,370
women were more accurate.

1342
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:02,940
And wives scored higher than
husbands on vividness of

1343
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:05,320
memories for first date, last
vacation, recent argument.

1344
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,740
So these are all averages.

1345
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:09,440
There's lots of overlap, but
an average is that way.

1346
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,540
And so Larry Cahill went
and did this thing.

1347
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:14,710
And sure enough, again, as he
found before, for men, the

1348
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:16,800
more they turned on the right
amygdala, the more certain

1349
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,130
they were to remember
negative films.

1350
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:21,330
And for women, the more they
turned on the left amygdala,

1351
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:22,470
the more certain they
would remember

1352
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:24,240
negative films on average.

1353
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,030

1354
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:31,810
Now, the thing to know is, on
average again, when you have

1355
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:34,290
people rate the kinds
of pictures we

1356
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:37,330
use, how do you think--

1357
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:38,210
here it is.

1358
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:40,690
This is one example where your
stereotype guesses probably

1359
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:42,810
play out for the averages.

1360
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:46,660
Who rates this as more scary,
or who says it's more scary,

1361
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:48,710
men or women?

1362
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:50,940
OK.

1363
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:53,250
So positive or negative,
I should say

1364
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:54,620
for positive or negative.

1365
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:56,860
Here's the women, not finding
this a particularly--

1366
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:58,940
on average, and there's
a range of responses--

1367
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:01,540

1368
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:02,200
positive picture.

1369
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,490
Here's men going, pretty cool.

1370
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:06,110
What DVD did that come from?

1371
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:10,290
So people are always asking,
what does this really mean?

1372
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:14,300
Are men just knowing they have
to do this or whatever?

1373
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:15,090
Who knows?

1374
00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:17,000
There's no answer to this about
whether it's social

1375
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,610
things or biology.

1376
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:22,020
Certainly social things are
a big part of the story.

1377
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:24,100
When we have people rate the
pictures in the scanner,

1378
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,560
here's the women rating here's
the worst pictures.

1379
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:27,130
And look at the men.

1380
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:29,940
They're less willing to rate
these pictures as bad.

1381
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:32,795
Again, psychologists who see
these data say, well, maybe

1382
00:56:32,795 --> 00:56:35,610
the men think they're never
supposed to rate them as bad,

1383
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:37,610
because we're tough guys
and nothing's so bad.

1384
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:38,380
I mean, I don't know.

1385
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:39,320
Who knows?

1386
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,570
But this is the ratings.

1387
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:42,830

1388
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:44,830
Now, if we look at the
activation of the men and

1389
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:48,590
women on the left as they rate
them, the worse they rate it,

1390
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:51,140
the more intense they find it,
the more they turned on their

1391
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:51,970
left amygdala.

1392
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:55,450
So at the moment they're rating
them, men and women

1393
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:57,510
look very similar.

1394
00:56:57,510 --> 00:56:59,840
But when we relate it to their
memory, two things happen.

1395
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,350
First, the women did have
superior memory to the men.

1396
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:04,010
These were Stanford
undergraduates, probably not

1397
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:07,440
that dissimilar on average to
the people in this room.

1398
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:12,200
And quite strikingly, as you
saw it, activation in the

1399
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,800
right hemisphere predicted
memory in men, and the left

1400
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:17,520
hemisphere for women.

1401
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,750
So I know there's been a
lot of right and left.

1402
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:21,820
But here we think
was the message.

1403
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:24,490
And it's kind of stood
the test of time a

1404
00:57:24,490 --> 00:57:27,310
little bit, on average.

1405
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:30,480
What you see here is the part of
the left amygdala turned on

1406
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,120
for women as they're
rating it.

1407
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:34,550
The more intense,
the more active.

1408
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:36,880
In relation to whether they form
a long term memory, the

1409
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,580
more active, the more likely
they'll remember it.

1410
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:41,250
And kind of the physical
overlap of the two.

1411
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:45,970
In men, more active in that
amygdala on the left during

1412
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:47,350
the rating, but doesn't
seem to be

1413
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:50,460
involved in memory formation.

1414
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:53,920
In the hippocampus, again,
overlap, overlap, overlap.

1415
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,860
No apparent overlap
in the men.

1416
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:58,590
So what happens literally in the
brain, I mean, literally

1417
00:57:58,590 --> 00:58:00,890
as far as we can measure it, in
women on average there was

1418
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:03,860
more overlap between the parts
of the brain engaged as you

1419
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:06,460
evaluate something and the parts
of the brain that make

1420
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:08,470
the memory of that.

1421
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:11,990
And in men, on average it was
as if, here's my emotional

1422
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:14,480
rating on the right, and here's
what I'm going to

1423
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,130
remember on the left.

1424
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:18,150
Kind of a separation of
those processes in

1425
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:20,350
the most simple sense.

1426
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:23,160
Now here's a huge question.

1427
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:26,230
Does this brain imaging study
tell us anything about whether

1428
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:30,150
this is in the genes of boys and
girls as they're born or a

1429
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:32,430
consequence of socialization
or both?

1430
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:35,320

1431
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:38,730
It's incredibly intuitive for
people to think that if you

1432
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:42,370
see it in the brain it's
hardwired and genetic or

1433
00:58:42,370 --> 00:58:45,000
hormonal or something.

1434
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,630
Brain imaging data never
tells you that.

1435
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:48,880
It never tells you that.

1436
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,820
It just tells you by this age,
this is what's going on.

1437
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:54,680
And you don't have to know much
psychology to know that

1438
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:58,420
we're all hugely influenced to
varying degrees, but we're all

1439
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:01,750
hugely influenced by social
influences on what it is to be

1440
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:04,760
a male or a female in our
families, in our cultures, in

1441
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,690
our societies.

1442
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:09,120
Whether something's in your
genes or in your culture, it

1443
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:11,160
shows up in your brain.

1444
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,640
And we can't tell those
two things apart.

1445
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,780
Is this anything to do
with how we're born?

1446
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:20,630
Is this anything to do with how
Hollywood pitches movies

1447
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:27,320
that are about video game
battles versus chick flicks,

1448
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,930
how they're pitching that and
trying to tell us we're

1449
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:30,640
supposed to like something?

1450
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:31,500
Who knows?

1451
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:35,690
We can't tell if it's social
or genetic at all.

1452
00:59:35,690 --> 01:00:07,210
