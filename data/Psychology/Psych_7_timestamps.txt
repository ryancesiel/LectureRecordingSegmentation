10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,930
PROFESSOR: So today we're going
to talk about attention.

11
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:36,870
And sometimes we talk about
patients who are very unusual.

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,350
In the next lecture,
we will do that.

13
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:42,210
We'll talk about spectacular
disorders of attention.

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,650
But today we're going to talk
about attention as it

15
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,910
typically occurs in you sitting
here right now.

16
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,440
I want to convince you that in
addition to slips of attention

17
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,520
that can occur as you get older,
also how you attend to

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,180
the world around you is weirder
than you think.

19
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,740
In a broad sense, I hope to
convince you that it's

20
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,760
happening all the time.

21
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,269
Right now, as you go back to
your room, as you walk to the

22
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:06,500
next class, or your room.

23
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,540
How you attend to what's around
you in the world is

24
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,730
weirder than you think.

25
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:12,760
So what is attention?

26
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,670
What do we mean by attending
to things?

27
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,340
So William James was a
psychologist at Harvard who,

28
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,160
in many ways, articulated
concepts in psychology that,

29
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,950
till this day, turned out to
be beautiful ways to talk

30
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,200
about them in an
everyday sense.

31
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,060
"Everybody knows what
attention is.

32
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,960
It's the taking possession by
the mind in clear and vivid

33
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,760
form of one out of what seems
like several simultaneous

34
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,530
objects or trains of thought.

35
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,720
It applies withdrawal of some
things in order to deal with

36
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:38,940
others."

37
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,090
So a big idea there is we can
pay attention to some things

38
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,820
and there's a lot of
things around us.

39
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,930
And so we have to pick where
we focus our attention.

40
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,650
A little bit like if
you have a budget.

41
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,820
If you have some money, what
do you spend your money on,

42
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,400
and what do not spend
your money on?

43
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,730
So we're going to talk
about attention.

44
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,540
It's kind of similar to
the idea of awareness.

45
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,130
What are you aware of?

46
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,020
Or what are you conscious of?

47
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,760
And two themes across the talk
will be we often attend to

48
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,050
more than we realize.

49
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,310
And I'll show you very specific
evidence for that.

50
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:10,060
But we often attend to
things less than we

51
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,350
realize all the time.

52
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,480
And here's roughly
the outline.

53
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,670
We're saying attention, what you
pay attention to, is kind

54
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,190
of a gatekeeper to what you
perceive and what you know.

55
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,380
Attention is very limited.

56
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,610
We can only process one
thing at a time.

57
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,940
And because of that, we miss a
lot around us all the time.

58
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,970
There are unconscious processes
that pick up

59
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:29,560
information.

60
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,870
So sometimes things that we
don't notice do influence us.

61
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,840
And attention can be
viewed as kind of a

62
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,970
dialogue between two things.

63
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,390
Between things in the world that
capture your attention.

64
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,840
If somebody throws a ball at
you, something dramatic

65
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,540
happens-- you hear a scary
sound that captures your

66
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,190
attention--

67
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,220
we talk about that as
"bottom-up" processing.

68
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,610
It impinges on you.

69
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,210
It forces you to attend to it.

70
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,600
Because it's danger, it's
moving, it's unusual.

71
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,830
And then, "top-down" things.

72
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:55,680
What's your goal?

73
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,310
What are you paying
attention to?

74
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:57,980
What do you care about?

75
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,860
What are you up to?

76
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,815
People call that top-down
processing.

77
00:03:00,815 --> 00:03:03,520
So things that the environment
drives into your attention

78
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,440
because they're so dramatic,
bottom-up.

79
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,460
Things that you're looking for,
thinking about, you know

80
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,210
are useful for your purposes,
top-down.

81
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,880

82
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,930
There's tremendous evidence that
we encode a very small

83
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,710
fraction of what's around us
in a very specific way.

84
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,760
Estimate with me how often a
day, on average, since you've

85
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,770
been about five or six or seven
and you've been allowed

86
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,160
to have any money in your
possession at all.

87
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,290
Do you think you've held
or seen a penny?

88
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,540
OK, so we all know the
horror when you're

89
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,910
handed $0.4 in change.

90
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,100
That's 4 pennies right there.

91
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,540
So we'll make an estimate.

92
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,230
Pretend from age 5 to 20 you've
been handling change.

93
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,470
So maybe you've encountered
3 pennies a day.

94
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,330
OK, that's reasonable?

95
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,690
OK.

96
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,780
We don't have to be just
in the right ballpark.

97
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,290
There's 365 days a year,
skip 15 years.

98
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,670
Just do the multiplication.

99
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:05,770
You end up with about 16,380
penny experiences.

100
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,710
All right, so we all know that
if you head towards midterms,

101
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,320
it's going to be hard to study
a lot of stuff quickly.

102
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,390
But if somebody said to you,
if you study something

103
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:18,589
approximately 17,000 times,
you'd think, well, that one

104
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:20,350
I'm going to get.

105
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,930
So let's ask the question.

106
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,590
Does the Lincoln penny face
to the left or the right?

107
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,360
Is there anything above his
head or below his head?

108
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,560
Is there anything on the penny
to the left or to the right?

109
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,600
And how about the other side?

110
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,320
And how many of you with
approximately 17,000, or

111
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,800
certainly many thousands of
visual experiences with a

112
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,820
penny would bet something that
means a lot to you on the

113
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,000
correctness of your answer to
these 5 fundamental questions?

114
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,480

115
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,730
This is good teamwork.

116
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:55,260

117
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,340
Let's take it multiple choice.

118
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,590
That's better, right?

119
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:02,767

120
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:04,380
AUDIENCE: It faces the right.

121
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,860
PROFESSOR: You're making
me feel better because

122
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,810
of the fouls up.

123
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,330
And I appreciate that.

124
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:11,170
This is actually what
it looks like.

125
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:14,490
So what do you think it means
that 17,000 exposures to a

126
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:19,110
penny don't leave in you a
reasonably accurate memory of

127
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,190
the main things you
see in a penny?

128
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,390
How could that happen?

129
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,670
And it happens to everybody.

130
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,730
In fact, when they
do experiments,

131
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,540
here's people's drawings.

132
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,190
Don't feel bad if you
didn't know it.

133
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,590
Half the people don't even think
that the version that

134
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,970
you show them, if you ask them
is plausibly correct, you show

135
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,830
the correct answer,
they go no.

136
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,910
That can't be right, OK?

137
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,130
So here's one thing.

138
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:48,450
If we don't attend to something
very specifically,

139
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:52,700
we can see it a tremendous
number of times and it leaves

140
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:57,320
no impression on our mind
and no memory of it.

141
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,160
Now, why is that in
an everyday sense?

142
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,400
We don't know on a deep
science sense.

143
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,540
But what do you think
the point of it is?

144
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,870
Why don't you know what
a penny looks like?

145
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,000
Because it's not important
somebody said.

146
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,540
Yeah.

147
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:13,870
Because it's close enough to see
that brown smallish thing,

148
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,010
and you don't need the rest of
any information to hand the

149
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,680
money back and forth.

150
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,060
So what you attend to, what you
decide is important, makes

151
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,610
incredible difference.

152
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,350
And nothing else makes
up for it.

153
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:31,400
17,000 exposures don't make up
for what a penny looks like.

154
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:42,400

155
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,830
So, it was research at MIT
that used this method of

156
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,390
simultaneously processing two
messages in the two ears, the

157
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:52,490
shadowed message, the one you're
copying, and the second

158
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,920
message, the one that you
try to pick up, but

159
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,960
it's hard to do.

160
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,760
So they ask in the ear that
you're not paying attention

161
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,080
to, what can you pick up?

162
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,570
Here is what you can pick up
if a voice is present.

163
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,540
Now you just imagine silence
versus somebody talking.

164
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,940
That you can notice.

165
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,420
If the voice changes from
a man to a woman--

166
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,300
if it changes from a man to
woman, you can pick that up in

167
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,860
the unattended ear,
the one you're not

168
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,780
paying attention to.

169
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,585
Or if the voice goes-- a
person's talking and, all of a

170
00:07:19,585 --> 00:07:20,880
sudden, it goes er.

171
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,490
You notice that.

172
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,660
Here's what you don't notice.

173
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,010
Anything about the content.

174
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,190
I mean, that's what
you experience.

175
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,745
You can switch the language
of the message.

176
00:07:30,745 --> 00:07:33,480
You can go from English to
Spanish, or Italian.

177
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,215
A person won't notice
that it's changed.

178
00:07:35,215 --> 00:07:39,730

179
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:42,860
You can also change whether
it's typical speech or

180
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,710
backward nonsense speech,
which sounds very weird.

181
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,220
You don't notice that either.

182
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,125
So you notice a few things.

183
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,380
But there's a lot of
other things you

184
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,370
don't notice at all.

185
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:56,350
Now, you may have all had the
experience of what's called

186
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,950
the cocktail party phenomenon.

187
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,400
Do you know what that is?

188
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,760
Have you ever been talking with

189
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,710
people, you're at a party.

190
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,650
You're at some events, or
something like that.

191
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,910
And somebody mentions
your name.

192
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:09,240
Especially your first
name, but your name.

193
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,450
Maybe your last name
works, too.

194
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:11,530
And then all of a sudden,
you notice a

195
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:12,710
conversation around you.

196
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,650
It's almost hard to pay
attention to the person you're

197
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,880
talking to because the person
over there has just said your

198
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,880
name and you wonder what they're
saying about you.

199
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,170
Now, here's a really interesting
paradox.

200
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,100
How did you not notice
that other

201
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,920
conversation, which you didn't?

202
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,270
That's like the shadowing
task.

203
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,890
I'm talking to one person,
there's some hubbub over here.

204
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,020
I don't know what they're
talking about.

205
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,400
All a sudden, they say my name
and I notice what they're

206
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:34,820
talking about.

207
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,690
Well, how did that happen?

208
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:36,919
I wasn't paying attention
to it.

209
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,390
I don't know anything
about it.

210
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:41,799
But my name pounced out
in my mind and drew my

211
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,630
attention to it.

212
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,230
So it's kind of a paradox.

213
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:47,220
I'm not paying attention, but
somehow I pick up my name.

214
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,750
And so we'll talk a little
bit more about this.

215
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,640
But people have looked at this
very experimentally.

216
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,400
So here's how they
approached it.

217
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,960
They would, again, hear a
sentence in one ear, "The man

218
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,590
approached the bank." That's
the one they're repeating.

219
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:02,330
And in the other ear, they
would hear one of two

220
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,010
different words.

221
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,830
In the unattended ear, they're
not getting much out of that.

222
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:08,590
They would hear the word "money"
or "river." So now the

223
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,190
bank could be interpreted as
you went to the bank to

224
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,580
deposit your paycheck, or you
want to the bank to have a

225
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,720
picnic by the river.

226
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,980
Two different meanings of the
word "bank" are suggested by

227
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,900
the word you hear in the ear
that you're not processing

228
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,620
information in.

229
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,420
And then the people tell you,
well, tell me what the

230
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,740
sentence is you just
heard, kind of.

231
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,390
And people are primed to give
the interpretation of the

232
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:32,480
sentence that goes with the word
that's suggested in the

233
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,940
ear they weren't listening to.

234
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,630
So something in their mind and
brain heard enough of that to

235
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,700
influence what they're
interpreting in

236
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,220
the attended ear.

237
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,580
Here's another example.

238
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,650
They're shadowing, they're
paying attention and repeating

239
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,630
aloud an essay in one ear.

240
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:51,810
And in the other ear, they hear
something that's like a

241
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,090
word "taxi fare." And they pick
words that are spelled

242
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,590
two different ways, homonyms.

243
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,750
So the word F-A-R-E
or F-A-I-R.

244
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,240
Now, if you were typically--

245
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,160
if I ask you to write down the
word "fair" and spell it

246
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,620
correctly, you might say, well,
which one do you want or

247
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,460
something like that?

248
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,140
But if I didn't tell you
anything, most people would

249
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,090
put down the word F-A-I-R
most of the time.

250
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:12,570
It's a more common word.

251
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,120
But what they found is this.

252
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,045
They finished the experiment.

253
00:10:15,045 --> 00:10:16,510
They shadowed one thing.

254
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:19,430
They had a word like "taxi fare"
in the unattended ear.

255
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,800
And they said, well, did you
notice you got that word?

256
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,230
Well, if you listen to it, you
remembered you heard "taxi

257
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,840
fare." But if you were shadowed,
you pretty much--

258
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,650
you very rarely remembered
that you heard it.

259
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:33,050
So it's not consciously
available to you that you

260
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,500
heard it because you were so
busy in the other ear.

261
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,170
And in your mind, listening
to that ear.

262
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,230
But if you're asked to spell
the word, how often do you

263
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:43,520
come up with the rare spelling
because of what you

264
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,600
heard in your ear?

265
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,740
It's exactly the same.

266
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,140
So part of your mind heard that
word, thought about that

267
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,900
phrase "taxi fare." And when
somebody says to you write

268
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,300
down the word "fair," your mind
got moved to think about

269
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,095
the alternative spellings.

270
00:10:59,095 --> 00:11:02,580
Your unconscious processing of
that content has influenced

271
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,870
you in experimentally
verifiable way.

272
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,880
So what this shows, if you go
back to the cocktail party

273
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,500
effect, which is the everyday
kind of version of this, is

274
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,040
that weirdly enough some kinds
of things that we don't pay

275
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,450
attention to have such
a property that in a

276
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:18,910
machine-like reflexive way our
mind brain process it to some

277
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,650
extent anyway.

278
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,250
And then there's something
curious that we don't

279
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,880
understand deeply, which is
somehow if it's your name,

280
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,260
it's going like, I'm
hearing my name.

281
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:27,990
I'm hearing my name.

282
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,580
Pay attention over here.

283
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,640
That's a deep psychological,
computational theory.

284
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,020
And somehow you pull it out
because it's triggered your

285
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:35,620
mind enough.

286
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,200
Because our names are
so important to us.

287
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,420
Yeah?

288
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,392
AUDIENCE: Is this similar
to [INAUDIBLE]?

289
00:11:40,392 --> 00:11:49,266

290
00:11:49,266 --> 00:11:50,530
PROFESSOR: OK, tell me again.

291
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,790
So the phenomenon where if you
notice a word-- go ahead.

292
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,190
So tell me again.

293
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:53,450
Sorry.

294
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,842
AUDIENCE: Like you're just
looking around and suddenly a

295
00:11:54,842 --> 00:11:58,285
specific word [INAUDIBLE].

296
00:11:58,285 --> 00:11:59,220
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

297
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,880
It's very much aligned
to the same thing.

298
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,900
The question was, something pops
in your head-- a word--

299
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,190
and then you look back and
you go, wait a minute.

300
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,190
I just read that, but
I wasn't even

301
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,710
thinking about it or something.

302
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,040
Somebody said it or
it's on a sign.

303
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,400
But yes.

304
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,820
Some experience you're not
paying much attention to tips

305
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,080
your mind to think
a certain way.

306
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,580
And all of a sudden you're
thinking that way and you

307
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,090
don't know what tipped
your mind that way.

308
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,340
That's very similar, yeah.

309
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:30,590

310
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:35,285
So again, the message here is,
as you're walking around in

311
00:12:35,285 --> 00:12:37,850
the world, there's very few
things that you're very

312
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,510
specifically really aware of.

313
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:44,700
And many things can change
on you in these examples.

314
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,380
So one of the reasons-- this
is just a thought that by

315
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,700
being selective in attention,
you can focus on what you want

316
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,310
to focus on.

317
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,720
It's not only a weakness,
it's a strength.

318
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,620
So you could pick out the
message in red or you could

319
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,330
pick out the message in blue.

320
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,590
Where you attend helps
you select

321
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,920
information that's relevant.

322
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,390
But here's two more works.

323
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:05,135
Almost all the examples I just
showed you were from Dan

324
00:13:05,135 --> 00:13:07,420
Simons, who's done really
beautiful work in this way.

325
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,040
Made it very available to--

326
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,310
so here's two YouTube ones.

327
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:25,200

328
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,880
Sometimes people have said, OK,
these are cute laboratory

329
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,960
things where you're having
people counting.

330
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,850
But the real world
is different.

331
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:36,100
When I'm out of the classroom
and I'm out of the laboratory,

332
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,490
the real world you kind
of notice a lot more.

333
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,660
Because it's real people,
real situations.

334
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,800
So this is one more
example that's a

335
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,050
beautiful example of this.

336
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:54,180

337
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,810
So do you think it would have
worked if the replacement

338
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,440
person was very different?

339
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,780
If we was a man or a woman, of
if a very taller person versus

340
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,900
a person not--

341
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,780
no.

342
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,290
But what does that mean?

343
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:08,260
Why does it work for this one?

344
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:12,740
And why would it-- it means
that in the person's head,

345
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,330
they have a very rough picture
of who they're talking to.

346
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,210
Does that make sense?

347
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,610
So there's a lot of room
for replacement.

348
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,140
Not total room, but a
very rough picture.

349
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,010
But it's right in
front of them.

350
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,590
OK, now, you've seen this thing,
so I won't do it as a

351
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:30,080
demonstration now, where people
simply read the words,

352
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,570
the red, orange, brown.

353
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,930
And that's easy because you're
a very automatic reader.

354
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:38,670
If you're a typical adult, you
read about 250 words a minute.

355
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,810
Zoom, zoom, zoom.

356
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,090
But if you have to name the
color of the print when the

357
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:46,430
print is contradicted by the
word, so you're reading the

358
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:52,160
word red printed in green, but
your job is to say green.

359
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,040
That naming of the print when
the word is not matching the

360
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,040
color of the print slows
people down.

361
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,900
They make mistakes.

362
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,780
They're slower.

363
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,240
And that's because there's
a big lesson in this.

364
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,980
It's great to get automatic
at things.

365
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,690
That's how we're skilled at
things-- speaking, driving,

366
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:06,910
everything physical.

367
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,530
We don't even think
about how we walk.

368
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:12,900
The price of automaticity
being really skilled and

369
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,170
reflexive is you lose control.

370
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,230
You lose control.

371
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,935
So you don't want to think about
what that word says, but

372
00:15:18,935 --> 00:15:19,560
you can't help but.

373
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,300
Now, let me touch
one more thing.

374
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,270
How many people think-- and just
be honest in your seat--

375
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:28,882
that hypnosis is kind
of bologna?

376
00:15:28,882 --> 00:15:29,990
OK.

377
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,410
All right, a lot of you.

378
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,420
This is MIT, right?

379
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,040
OK.

380
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,250
So I'm going to tell you that I
think a lot of hypnosis, the

381
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,030
kinds of things where if I learn
how to hypnotize people,

382
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:42,740
then they can all vote for me,
or something like that, that

383
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,900
doesn't work.

384
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,770
And people who are serious about
hypnosis will tell you

385
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,710
that hypnosis is in the person,
it's not in the

386
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,490
hypnotizer.

387
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,840
It's in the person, it's
not in the hypnotizer.

388
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,370
And it turns out that, in ways
that are not well understood,

389
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,970
there are some people who are
highly hypnotizeable and some

390
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,590
people who are not.

391
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,290
So this is why I think
we're suspicious.

392
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,450
Because if we're not, we're
going, well, they must be

393
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,160
faking it, or pretending,
or whatever.

394
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,170
But let me tell you what they
did and let me see if this

395
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,560
convinces you at all
as an experiment.

396
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,180
So they told people sometimes to
read those words where it's

397
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,800
confusing because you're reading
the color of the print

398
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,180
and the word is contradictory,
it slows you down.

399
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,090
They told them, imagine those
characters are characters in a

400
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:28,840
foreign language that
you do not know.

401
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,850
Would the content of the word
mess you up for the

402
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,380
color of the print?

403
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,670
No.

404
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:36,260
Because if it's a language you
don't know, it's just stuff

405
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,120
and you can just name--

406
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,130
OK?

407
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,280
And they asked them
to imagine that.

408
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,020
Now, here's what happened.

409
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,060
For people who are low
hypnotizability, you can give

410
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,270
people questionnaires and
they're pretty good at these

411
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,520
kinds of measures.

412
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,460

413
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:52,240
They're slowed down by about a
tenth of a second per word

414
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,130
when the information
is contradictory.

415
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,740
And when they're asked to
imagine it's a foreign

416
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,410
language, it's about the same.

417
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:00,000
The low hypnotizables, you can
tell them, imagine it's a

418
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,750
print you don't know.

419
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,710
It doesn't matter.

420
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,890
Here's the high hypnotizable.

421
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,750
Also slowed down.

422
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,050
But when they imagine it's a
print in a foreign language

423
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,750
they don't know, not
slowed down at all.

424
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,380

425
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,800
So that's behavior.

426
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,119
That's evidence.

427
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,630
And we don't think you can
fake it because how

428
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,220
would you fake it?

429
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,170
But here, in case you were
still worried about that,

430
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:27,109
here's the brain imaging
evidence from just the people

431
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:30,880
with high hypnosis, the high
hypnotizable people.

432
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,330
What you see here turned
on is the part--

433
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,290
our brain areas are turned on
when you have to do the

434
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,530
difficult task where
it's contradictory

435
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,510
versus the easy task.

436
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,855
All this area you see turned on
in the anterior cingulate,

437
00:17:41,855 --> 00:17:43,250
and especially--

438
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,300
which is an area that we know
is involved when things are

439
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,750
contradictory or paradoxical and
people are sorting it out.

440
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,970
Look what happens to that when
these individuals are

441
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,050
imagining it's a foreign text.

442
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,740
It's pretty much gone.

443
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,900
Is that OK?

444
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,730
I'm as skeptical as anybody
about behavioral

445
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:00,870
claims, I really am.

446
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:04,400
I think hypnosis is real for
some people and very powerful

447
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,390
for some people.

448
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,850
And for other people it
doesn't work at all.

449
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:11,920
I happen to be in the low
hypnotizable category.

450
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,170
I'm as skeptical as anybody, but
I think there are people

451
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:17,800
who can do remarkable things
by hypnotic suggestion.

452
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,900
But it's in them, it's not in
the-- a person who hypnotizes

453
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,160
you, so to speak, can help
you a little bit.

454
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,020
But it's in you whether you have
that approach to control

455
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,270
of your thoughts or not.

456
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:32,220

457
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,760
So let's go back to a test.

458
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,520
So we're talking, again,
about two ideas.

459
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,270
That there's things--

460
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:40,470
top- down and bottom-up
processes, and different ways

461
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,010
that you can attend
to the world.

462
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,980
So I'm going to ask you to
consult your own intuitions

463
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,570
for the following thing.

464
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:50,770
I'm going to show you things
displayed on the monitor.

465
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,650
And your job is simply to answer
in your own mind as

466
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,470
quickly as you possibly can.

467
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,080
Maybe just, if you're willing to
do it out loud, let's just

468
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,370
say yes or no aloud, if you're
willing to do it.

469
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,790
As quickly as you, whether you
see a red X. Sometimes there's

470
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,760
a red X, sometimes not.

471
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,250
So ready?

472
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,610
Sorry, that's my get ready.

473
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:07,885
AUDIENCE: No.

474
00:19:07,885 --> 00:19:09,370
PROFESSOR: No, great.

475
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,860
See, MIT is easy.

476
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,051
Sorry.

477
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:12,920
OK, ready?

478
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,046
Red X or not?

479
00:19:14,046 --> 00:19:14,720
AUDIENCE: Yes.

480
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,510
PROFESSOR: Great.

481
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,950
Ready?

482
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,380
OK.

483
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,990
Thank you.

484
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:20,350
Ready?

485
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,483
Red X or not?

486
00:19:21,483 --> 00:19:22,745
AUDIENCE: Yes.

487
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:23,200
PROFESSOR: Whoa.

488
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,050
You guys are amazing.

489
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,660
Now, look how many places you
had to look to find it.

490
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,170
But did it feel that way, or
did it seem to, what they

491
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:28,900
call, pop out?

492
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,530
It's just obvious.

493
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,840
It's just there.

494
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,430
So imagine I gave
you this task.

495
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:37,580
I said, go into this room and
please get a particular book.

496
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,610
And you go into the room and
there's one book there.

497
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:40,430
And you've picked it up.

498
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,596
Would that be easy?

499
00:19:41,596 --> 00:19:42,450
Yeah.

500
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,290
You go into a room and you go,
my gosh, there's hundreds of

501
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:45,940
books in this room.

502
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,230
Would that be easy?

503
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:50,520
Now, here are many, many more
things to find the red X. But

504
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:55,390
your mind instantly, easily,
trivially finds it, right?

505
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:58,371
So now, let's try another
version of this.

506
00:19:58,371 --> 00:19:58,760
AUDIENCE: Yes.

507
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,740
PROFESSOR: Yes?

508
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,990
OK, get ready.

509
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,298

510
00:20:03,298 --> 00:20:04,680
AUDIENCE: Yes.

511
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,370
PROFESSOR: All right.

512
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:05,870
Slower?

513
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:06,450
Harder?

514
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:07,460
OK, some disagreement.

515
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,160
OK.

516
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,070
All right, so let me show you
data under well controlled

517
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,760
conditions.

518
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,320
And here's the concept.

519
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,250
People think that in many ways
when we look out in the world,

520
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,320
there's features, things
like simple things--

521
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,490
shape or color.

522
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,970
Those are the two we're
looking at here.

523
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:23,140
But in order to combine those,
to know the same thing out

524
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,420
there has this shape and this
color, to glue together

525
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,680
features, we have to
have attention.

526
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:35,100
And so when the display looked
like this, a single feature--

527
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,800
redness--

528
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,380
helps you.

529
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,180
A single feature-- redness--

530
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:39,610
helps you.

531
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,750
You don't have to worry
about the shape.

532
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,560
Now, you have to worry about
the shape and the color to

533
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,630
decide the red X. Worse
yet, now it's a

534
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:50,920
slower, harder process.

535
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,590
And when people do this, here's
exactly what they find.

536
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:56,760
If it's just a feature by shape
or by color and that

537
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,940
alone would tell you the answer,
you can have one

538
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,100
thing, a few things,
and many things.

539
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,820
And boom, your mind instantly
discovers it.

540
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,180
Instantly.

541
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,270
This is how long it takes
you to do it.

542
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:10,460
But if you have to combine two
things together, the shape and

543
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,310
the color on the very same
thing, combine those things,

544
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:15,180
you need the glue
of attention.

545
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,840
And the more things that are out
there, the more your mind

546
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,470
has to search, search, search,
search, until it

547
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,850
finally finds it.

548
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,690
It has to look around, and look
around, and look around

549
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,980
to find the answer.

550
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,970
So some kinds of things in the
world we notice without

551
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,550
attention features.

552
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:35,030
We can look everywhere at
once in the display.

553
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,700
That's how we're so fast.

554
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,230
Things just pop out.

555
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,580
And the flat slope is--
mathematically.

556
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,540
Doesn't matter how many things
are out there-- boom, you get

557
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,990
it right away.

558
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,310
Other things where we have to
glue together two features

559
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:50,130
require our attention
to do the gluing

560
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:50,940
things that are together.

561
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,200
We have to search spot,
spot, spot, serially.

562
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,280
We don't feel the intuition
of pop-out.

563
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,180
And we have a steep
slope in search.

564
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:03,270
Now I need somebody from their
chair who's pretty confident

565
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,520
in their math.

566
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,260

567
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,350
It's a little bit harder than
before, but I'll tell you

568
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,920
don't have to go into
triple digits.

569
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,010

570
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:16,050
Someone help me.

571
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,850
I owe you one.

572
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:18,760
I'll come back to you
if there's one more.

573
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,540
I can't remember, sorry.

574
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,900
OK, ready?

575
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,570
So you're going to see some
numbers and I want you to add

576
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:24,850
them and tell me
what they are.

577
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:25,950
And I'm going to
be pretty fast.

578
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:26,622
Is that OK?

579
00:22:26,622 --> 00:22:26,960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

580
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,700
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE].

581
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,950
AUDIENCE: OK.

582
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:31,475

583
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,095
PROFESSOR: Yes.

584
00:22:33,095 --> 00:22:34,025
OK?

585
00:22:34,025 --> 00:22:35,885
Ready?

586
00:22:35,885 --> 00:22:36,350
AUDIENCE: 14.

587
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,190
PROFESSOR: Yes.

588
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,474
Ready?

589
00:22:38,474 --> 00:22:39,560
AUDIENCE: 5.

590
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:39,830
PROFESSOR: Yes.

591
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,816
Ready?

592
00:22:40,816 --> 00:22:41,670
AUDIENCE: 10.

593
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:42,350
PROFESSOR: Yes.

594
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:42,730
Ready?

595
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,030
AUDIENCE: 13.

596
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:44,655
PROFESSOR: Yes.

597
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:48,570
Now what were the letters
between them?

598
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,000
Sorry, it's a trick.

599
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,005
It would have been mean.

600
00:22:51,005 --> 00:22:51,300
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

601
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,196
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

602
00:22:52,196 --> 00:22:53,988
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the last one so far.

603
00:22:53,988 --> 00:22:54,436
PROFESSOR: Interesting.

604
00:22:54,436 --> 00:22:54,890
OK.

605
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,750
Now, you can go, oh,
that was a trick.

606
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,750
How reasonable is that?

607
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:02,220
Well, let me make the argument
that in order to add the 5 and

608
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,570
the 8, you had to look
at the letters.

609
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:04,650
You had to look at
the letters.

610
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,050
They're in the middle.

611
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:10,650
But because your mind is not
attuned to that, it's as if

612
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,970
they weren't there almost.

613
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,005
You know some thing's
there, right?

614
00:23:14,005 --> 00:23:15,570
It's right in front of you.

615
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,810
It doesn't seem that hard.

616
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:19,040
But again, if your mind is tuned
to something, the other

617
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,960
stuff gets fuzzy.

618
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,610
And you got the R somewhere.

619
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,380
Now, let me ask one
more question.

620
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,171
Do you the colors the
letters were in?

621
00:23:28,171 --> 00:23:29,600
No.

622
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,370
And in fact, you don't.

623
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:34,200
So thanks very much for
willing to do that.

624
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:39,540
So again, we just said to bind
shape and color, we need the

625
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,420
glue of attention.

626
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,880
We're not attending to
the middle letters.

627
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,340
They seem irrelevant
even though they're

628
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,190
right in front of us.

629
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,670
Even though we have to walk
through them in our mind's eye

630
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,090
to move from one number
to the other.

631
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:50,270
They're like, I don't care.

632
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,700
Boom, you move to
the other side.

633
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,680
So it's not just seeing
something, it's attending to

634
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,760
something that really matters.

635
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,150
And on top of that, you need a
lot of attention if you do

636
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:00,010
glue together the shape
and the color, that

637
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,180
requires a lot of focus.

638
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:04,480
What does this mean
in everyday life?

639
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,750
In everyday life, we're probably
walking around

640
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:11,225
constantly having free floating
features around us

641
00:24:11,225 --> 00:24:13,340
and things we're not paying
attention to.

642
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:17,170
Right now I'm probably seeing a
yellow computer over there.

643
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:21,820
And I'm seeing some blue fire
extinguisher sign over there.

644
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:25,670
Now, why am I not freaked
out by that?

645
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,250
And why are you not freaked
out by that?

646
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,310
And why is it almost certain?

647
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,630
Because if you're not attending
to things, you're

648
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,340
constantly having free floating

649
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,320
features that are incorrect.

650
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,220
Colors and shapes are just
floating around you.

651
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,370
Why are we not disturbed
by that?

652
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:42,030
Because we're not attending
it to start with.

653
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,800
Because it's like you didn't
notice the letters were there.

654
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,530
Well, then you're
not bothered.

655
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,970
They're just free floating
information.

656
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,390
You're not paying attention
to it to start with.

657
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,410
But that's what's happening
in your mind all the time.

658
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:51,330
And these experiments
demonstrate that empirically

659
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:54,180
and directly.

660
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:57,370
There's also interesting
temporal constraints.

661
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,040
I'll describe this experiment
because it's too

662
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,000
hard to pull off here.

663
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,470
So there's a phenomenon called
the attentional blink.

664
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:05,020
What's weird about these
things, right?

665
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,280
Why is our minds like this?

666
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,630
You can speculate on that, but
it's really well documented.

667
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,340
We attend to a small
percentage of

668
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,540
what's around us.

669
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,275
And we need a lot of resources
to know something well or

670
00:25:15,275 --> 00:25:16,170
learn something well.

671
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,720
So here's another example.

672
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,800
What participants see is letters
presented very quickly

673
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,600
one after the other--

674
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,260
E-L-H. Their job is to report
any numbers that they see.

675
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,920
So you go, boom, boom,
boom, boom.

676
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,300
What were the numbers?

677
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,480
Pretty fast, but humanly
possible.

678
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,520
The interesting question is,
what's the time gap between

679
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,630
the two numbers that you see?

680
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,360
There's usually two numbers.

681
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,490
We'll call this one the
first one, time 1.

682
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,970
The second one, time 2.

683
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:44,230
What's the gap between them,
and how does that influence

684
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,000
whether you're likely
to report them?

685
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,450
So here's what's called the
attentional blink and a

686
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,760
slightly scary graph
that I'll tell you.

687
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,830
And let me tell you what it's
like, the metaphor, and then

688
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,060
let me show you the result.

689
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:58,860
The metaphor is this.

690
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:03,930
Your mind, moment to moment to
moment, is kind of like if you

691
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:07,820
could imagine you're next to a
stream, a big stream with a

692
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,120
lot of fish zooming by.

693
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,290
You have a fishnet.

694
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:13,110
You dip into the stream.

695
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:15,260
You catch something
at that moment.

696
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:18,740
But if a fish comes by just as
you pull your fishnet out,

697
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,925
will you catch that one?

698
00:26:19,925 --> 00:26:22,530
No.

699
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,320
So here's what happens.

700
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,320
Here's the time between
the presentation.

701
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,830

702
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:34,570
If there's approximately three
numbers between them, a couple

703
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:37,820
hundred milliseconds, you're
almost a chance for the

704
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,970
possibility of reporting
the second digit.

705
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:43,010
It's sort of like the fish you
can't catch because you just

706
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:43,860
took your net out.

707
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:47,110
Except it's your mind, it's
not a physical limitation.

708
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,160
So here's what it's like.

709
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,100
So this is perfect
performance.

710
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,530
This is chance performance.

711
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:54,710
If it immediately follows, one
number immediately follows the

712
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:57,480
next number, you're
going to get both.

713
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,850
And the way to think about that
is, it's kind of like

714
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:00,740
fishnet again.

715
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,590
You just put in your fishnet.

716
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,460
You got one fish.

717
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,170
And if you're lucky, while
you're kind of pulling it out,

718
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:06,410
the next fish just
swims in there.

719
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,180
You got two.

720
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,720
Now your fishnet's out.

721
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,650
And if something else comes, and
something else comes, and

722
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:14,910
something else comes, you're
pretty bad at recognizing it

723
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:17,180
was there at all.

724
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,440
A little bit of time comes back
and you put your fishnet

725
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,520
back in and you're catching
everything again.

726
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,640
About 1/2 second.

727
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,900
But how weird is that that your
mind works like that for

728
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,370
spotting the digits?

729
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,690
That it has to take a break?

730
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,030
There's a part of your mind
that's getting the digits.

731
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:37,180
And once it's gotten a digit,
for the next couple of hundred

732
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:41,090
milliseconds, it's not going to
have room to pay attention

733
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,170
to the following digits.

734
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:45,090
How weird is that?

735
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:47,620
It's because our mind has all
these kind of limitations on

736
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,860
what we perceive in
the environment.

737
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,830
Here's another sort of
fun example of that.

738
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,080
So here's a task.

739
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,030
One of these dots
are going to--

740
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,520
One dot is going to blink.

741
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,250
And your job is to keep
your eye on that dot.

742
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,090
You know when they say, keep
your eye on the ball.

743
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,260
Keep your eye on the dot.

744
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,055
And when it stops moving, notice
which is the one you've

745
00:28:07,055 --> 00:28:07,800
been keeping your eye on.

746
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,275
So the first one's going
to be easy, but it

747
00:28:09,275 --> 00:28:09,970
will give you a feeling.

748
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,200
And then you'll see the
answer given to you.

749
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:11,890
Ready?

750
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,260
People call this object
tracking.

751
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,976
OK, here we go.

752
00:28:15,976 --> 00:28:17,226
See that one blinking?

753
00:28:17,226 --> 00:28:32,500

754
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,185
Now, let's try it one thing
moving, but even faster.

755
00:28:35,185 --> 00:29:14,810

756
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,650
So let's try tracking
four things.

757
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:57,620

758
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,870
Last example.

759
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:16,160

760
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,590
So here's a graph with
a high level of

761
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,970
performance how people do.

762
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:24,390
So two things matter, and you
might have felt that.

763
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:27,070
How many are viewing the
number of targets?

764
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:29,800
And under many circumstances,
people seem to be able to do

765
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,780
about three to four.

766
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,120
But also, the speed
matters, too.

767
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:33,990
You might have felt that, too.

768
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,480
Both things contribute.

769
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,560
There's a lot of interest in
this three to four limit that

770
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,410
people seem to have for things
that they track,

771
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:42,420
three to four items.

772
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:45,000
And there's a lot of work,
at Harvard actually, in

773
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,680
developmental psychology
and related.

774
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,670
Let me just say a word
about that to you.

775
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:51,270
There's a thought that pretty
young when you're a kid, you

776
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,920
get to about this three
to four things.

777
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,510
That our minds naturally
contract about, or notice, or

778
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:58,490
keep a count of about three to
four things in the world.

779
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:03,130
And so people who study, for
example, math and the way that

780
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:05,960
humans perform it, think that we
have in us, in our brains,

781
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,180
approximately two systems that
are physically different and

782
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,090
culturally different.

783
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:11,455
And there's lots of debates
about this, I

784
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:12,760
should tell you this.

785
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,430
But one of them being something
like accurate

786
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:19,020
counting up to about
three or four.

787
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:22,580
And then, cultures that don't
have a organized system of

788
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,780
math, the next answer is many.

789
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,240
You've heard this, right?

790
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,580
It's like one, two, three, maybe
four, and then a lot.

791
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:35,220
Now, we don't stop counting at
four, but we might if we were

792
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,600
in a true state of nature and
we didn't have an organized

793
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,460
system of math.

794
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,200
And weren't taught that
in how it relates to

795
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,610
our language abilities.

796
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:43,780
So there's a lot of debate about
the exactness of this.

797
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,690
But there's something
fascinating about this idea

798
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:48,910
that our minds can have about
four units of information kept

799
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:51,195
in mind, kept active,
that we can track.

800
00:31:51,195 --> 00:31:55,750
And that lots of things in the
world reflect that limitation.

801
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:58,360
Including, for example,
exact counting.

802
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,730
And without the cultural
invention of mathematics, we

803
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:04,540
would count one, two,
three, four, lots.

804
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,690
But there's debates about this
because exactly how you

805
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:09,080
measure it can influence
how you think about it.

806
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,420
Now, can attention be trained?

807
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:14,550
Could you be trained to have
much more attention?

808
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,730
So in many ways, we don't
think you can.

809
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:18,290
But in some ways, you can.

810
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:21,140
And part of this has come out
of this ironic line of

811
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,640
research about things that are
supposed to be bad for us.

812
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,340
Some of them might
be OK for us.

813
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,620
Video games, OK?

814
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:31,310
If you're in my generation,
people are going, oh, boy,

815
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:35,060
those video games are messing
up all these kids.

816
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,950
Isn't that what you
guys think?

817
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,690
No.

818
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:39,160
OK.

819
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:43,030
So Daphne Bavelier at Rochester
has done a series of

820
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:45,310
studies showing that if you play
certain kinds of video

821
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:48,700
games, you actually do expand
your attentional capacity to

822
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,600
practice on those games.

823
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,490
Because they make you
practice a lot.

824
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:52,700
So here's what she did.

825
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,120
She took people who didn't
have experience

826
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,080
playing video games.

827
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,170
And now we're specifically
talking about first-person

828
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:00,940
shooter video games.

829
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:05,340
And had them do 30 hours
of practice.

830
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:09,210
And she looked at their ability
to do multiple object

831
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:11,880
tracking of the kind you just
saw, those dots whizzing

832
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,950
around, before and after.

833
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,390
So the games, as you know,
are very different.

834
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:18,340
But they involve keeping
track of lots of things

835
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,520
happening at once.

836
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,920
And here's what she found.

837
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:24,830
That these people who played
30 hours, these were people

838
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:28,210
who were not gamers beforehand,
got better at

839
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:30,480
performing these tasks
of keeping

840
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,410
track of multiple objects.

841
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:35,130
Of all things, a group that's
super interested in that is

842
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:36,410
the military.

843
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:39,078
And why do you think that is?

844
00:33:39,078 --> 00:33:40,860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

845
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,400
PROFESSOR: OK.

846
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,800
There was just a paper published
recently that if

847
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,320
they take a brain image of your
brain, they can predict

848
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,520
how good a gamer you'll
become if you haven't

849
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,360
been a gamer before.

850
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,570
These are adults.

851
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:55,050
If you have bigger basal
ganglia, you'll become a

852
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:59,420
better gamer in the next week
starting from scratch.

853
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,540
The military's interested
because you may know this.

854
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:05,560
An increasing amount of warfare
is video game-like.

855
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,320
Which is kind of the
haunting thing.

856
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,360
Because this is real people
really being killed.

857
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,550
But, do you know the whole
thing with the drones?

858
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,960
Have you followed this,
some of you?

859
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,560
OK.

860
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,600
So the US has had a lot of
success, and there's a lot of

861
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,670
debates about the ethics of
this, in sending in unmanned

862
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,949
small airplanes into
the Middle East.

863
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:28,110
And using that to
kill opponents.

864
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:30,310
The person sitting in
Washington, DC, or somewhere

865
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:34,020
else, is watching kind of like
a video game when they make

866
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,270
that decision about
whether that's

867
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:37,530
somebody to be attacked.

868
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:40,400
So a lot of operations now are
computer-based and they're

869
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,909
kind of like a video
game at one level.

870
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:45,830
And they're real-life hard
decisions at another level.

871
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,620
So video games, they're becoming
more and more, as you

872
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:52,340
can sense, a part of real world
decisions and controls.

873
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:56,350
If you play Tetris because it
doesn't require that kind of

874
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:58,360
fast thought stuff, you
don't get any benefit.

875
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,670
There could be other benefits,
but not this one.

876
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:04,040
So it's not just video games,
it's the mental processes that

877
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,150
are practiced in the video games
that give you certain

878
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:11,140
talents or not, or abilities
you didn't have before.

879
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,170
OK, the last experiment I want
to tell you is this.

880
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:16,060
So everything we've talked about
now, except a little bit

881
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,670
about the stuff in the second
year when you're shadowing,

882
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:25,670
has been about this idea that we
don't pay much attention to

883
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,180
what's around us.

884
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,320
We don't get much in our mind
compared to what we think we

885
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,270
would, even if it's right in
front of us, even if it's all

886
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:30,910
over the place.

887
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:33,520
Even if we've seen a
penny 17,000 times.

888
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,870
But there are some studies
that have shown something

889
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:39,030
pretty interesting also, which
reveals something very

890
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:41,650
paradoxical about
the human mind.

891
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:44,155
That we can sometimes know
things without seeing.

892
00:35:44,155 --> 00:35:46,290
And people call that subliminal
perception.

893
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:48,120
So how this experiment
works is this.

894
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,545
And let me show you one
example behaviorally.

895
00:35:49,545 --> 00:35:51,690
I'm going to show you
one brain example.

896
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:53,070
So here's what happens.

897
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:55,260
Let's pretend you have
to read words aloud.

898
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,450
And we measure, to the
millisecond, how fast

899
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:58,780
you read the word.

900
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,820
If I show you this word and I
show you this word, and I

901
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:04,080
measure how quickly you read
the word "doctor," you're

902
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,380
slower than if you read the word
"nurse" and then you read

903
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:10,610
the word "doctor." Because
these two are related.

904
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:12,270
And something in your
mind gets warmed up

905
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,430
when you see this.

906
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:16,730
It doesn't get warmed up
in a relevant way when

907
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:17,260
you see this word.

908
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,240
Does that make sense?

909
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,090
You see one word and then
you read the next one.

910
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,340
If they're related semantically
or conceptually

911
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,400
by meaning, you're faster
for the second one.

912
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,330
OK, that's easy.

913
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,000
And it's not too surprising.

914
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,390
The clever discovery was this.

915
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,600
What they do is they do
something call-- they present

916
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,450
these words under what they
call masked conditions.

917
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:36,510
On the computer monitor you
get something busy, like a

918
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:37,620
roll of X's.

919
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:41,700
For 10 milliseconds only,
ten-thousandths of a second,

920
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,770
the word appears, and then
there's a bunch of X's again.

921
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:47,740
So it's like a flash of X's.

922
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,930
And people, they create
situations--

923
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:51,440
and I'll show you this
again in a moment.

924
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,490
They create situations where
people say, I'm not sure

925
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:55,410
anything was there.

926
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,780
I certainly don't
know what it is.

927
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,150
You have to be there and you
have to convince yourself, as

928
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,810
a scientist, that you've
done that.

929
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:02,780
And then they have
you read the word

930
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,480
"doctor" in full view.

931
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,250
And in these circumstances where
people cannot tell you

932
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:10,310
that they saw a word, and they
certainly can't tell you what

933
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:14,820
the word was, you still
get faster.

934
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:19,910
So they don't know that they saw
"church" or "nurse," but

935
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:22,110
something in their
mind picks it up.

936
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,170
And what's picked up in the
mind under the subliminal

937
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:28,250
presentation changes the
behavior when you have an

938
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,830
overt act of behavior reading
the next word aloud.

939
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:34,380
So this is hardcore empirical
evidence that your mind is

940
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,990
able to pick up stuff at
the level of meaning.

941
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:38,400
Think about the paradox.

942
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,350
You think when I read a word, I
see it and then I understand

943
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:42,530
its meaning.

944
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:46,170
Here it's flashed in such a way
that you don't feel like

945
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:49,380
you see it, but you extract
its meaning anyway.

946
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,290
And we know that because it
makes you read the next word

947
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:53,410
faster only if they're
related in meaning.

948
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:55,630
So your mind is subliminally
primed.

949
00:37:55,630 --> 00:38:00,050
Now, some years ago people used
to worry that advertisers

950
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:02,720
could do this really cleverly
and make you go do stuff.

951
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,960
The famous example is
historically, can they make

952
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,890
you buy popcorn?

953
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:08,480
Which is now, since it's $48,
that's harder to do.

954
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,420
But can they make you buy
popcorn at the movie theater?

955
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,770
Or can they make you buy a
Ford, or a Chevrolet, or

956
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:17,570
something like that, with the
right subliminal message and

957
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:18,730
that kind of stuff?

958
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:21,900
Every experiment that's been
done to ask whether subliminal

959
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,680
messages of this kind would
make you get up and go do

960
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,320
something, like buy a car, or
change what country you live

961
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,500
in, or something,
it never works.

962
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,740
It never works.

963
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,110
Nobody's ever been able
to show that in any

964
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,380
experimental condition.

965
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,090
Which doesn't prevent some
companies from selling these

966
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:41,310
products to store owners that
are thinking they're getting

967
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:43,130
their sales up.

968
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:45,390
But there's been never any
evidence that these kinds of

969
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:48,270
subliminal presentations make
people do something big and

970
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:51,140
complicated, like get up and go
buy popcorn, or choose one

971
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,410
product over another.

972
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,390
People have never been able to
show that under controlled

973
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:54,970
experiment.

974
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:57,490
But they have been able to show
these kinds of changes in

975
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:01,060
behavior that last a moment.

976
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,270
So what's happening
in your brain?

977
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,720
So this is the last
experiment.

978
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,240
Again, they're presenting these
things that in the same

979
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,260
place in the computer monitor
all these things

980
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,870
to fill your eyes.

981
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:16,080
And then they present a word
for either 29 milliseconds-

982
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:19,840
they present it either very
briefly or in full view.

983
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:24,410
OK, so here it's visible
because they remove the

984
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:27,060
confusing visual information
just before and after it.

985
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,120
Here, people don't
report seeing it.

986
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,810
And scientifically, it's really
important because you

987
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:33,300
just say, oh, people
didn't see it.

988
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,630
But it's really important
in our field to

989
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,090
say, we're so convinced.

990
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,520
And why are we so convinced?

991
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,590
Because we say, was there
any word present?

992
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,290
Because sometimes there's a
word present and sometimes

993
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:41,790
there isn't.

994
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:43,470
Just is there a word present?

995
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:45,780
If you could see the word,
because these things were a

996
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,350
little bit away in time and you
could see it, you almost

997
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,980
always got it if
it was visible.

998
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,130
You almost never got
it if it was here.

999
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:54,770
You almost never said there
was a word present.

1000
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:56,660
And could you name it?

1001
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,060
Yes, if you saw it like this.

1002
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,300
You couldn't name it if it was
presented brief-- if it was

1003
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,590
surrounded by this
visual stuff that

1004
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:03,030
makes it hard to see.

1005
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:06,170
If they give you a memory test
for it, if you saw it fully in

1006
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,320
full view, you got it.

1007
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,400
If it was hidden like
this, you didn't.

1008
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,730
And finally, they give
you a fourth choice.

1009
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:13,820
They say, did you see the word
"note" or did you see the word

1010
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,900
"coat?" Choose between
the two.

1011
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,510
People are still at
chance 50-50.

1012
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,790
They're really pushing
people to say,

1013
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,260
really, did you see anything?

1014
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:22,950
Do you know what it was?

1015
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:25,610
There are completely a chance
they don't remember anything.

1016
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:27,980
They can't even tell if
a word was there.

1017
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,800
But we know it influences
their mind.

1018
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,890
And now let me show you what we
know of how it influences

1019
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:33,090
your brain.

1020
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:35,610
So what's shown here in green
are parts of your brain that

1021
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:39,230
respond when a word is shown
that you can see.

1022
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,680
And what's shown here in red
are the parts of your brain

1023
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,320
that respond for that
subliminally presented word,

1024
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,860
the word that's presented but
you can't tell that any word

1025
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,870
was there, never mind
what word it was.

1026
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:54,290
So at first you can see there's
a lot more brain

1027
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:57,750
response for the visible than
the masked or subliminal word.

1028
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,190
But that makes a lot of sense.

1029
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,240
You see something, you think
about, you know it happened.

1030
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,480
But you can measure what's
happening in the brain.

1031
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,860
It's very small.

1032
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,510
Take this spot.

1033
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:08,400
Here's the response if
it's in full view.

1034
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,350
Here's a tiny, tiny, tiny,
tiny response when it's

1035
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:13,080
presented in that
minimalist way.

1036
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,910
But it's measurable
and it's present.

1037
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:18,020
And we know that it's enough
for you to figure out

1038
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,960
unconsciously what the meaning
of that word was.

1039
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,540
So then, we ended with this
paradox, which is on the one

1040
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:27,480
hand, we live in a world where
we only notice a small

1041
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,050
fraction of what's around us.

1042
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:30,960
What we focus our attention
to because we have limited

1043
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,780
attentional capacity.

1044
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,860
On the other hand, there are
channels of information that

1045
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,580
sneak into your mind.

1046
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:39,860
That probably influence you only
for a few moments in the

1047
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:42,180
unattended ear, in the
cocktail parity.

1048
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,240
You're actually picking up that
conversation because if

1049
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,330
they say your name,
you'll get it.

1050
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:48,620
Here's an example where your
brain is responding to a word

1051
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:51,310
you cannot identify or know
that it was presented, and

1052
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:54,840
those things can slightly move
your behavior around.

1053
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:58,800
But not in a science fiction or
marketing dream that they

1054
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,770
could make you go do something
really big.

1055
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,260
OK, that's never been shown
and people have

1056
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,370
tried to show that.

1057
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:05,770
So attention is really weirder
than you think.

1058
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:08,120
You don't notice a lot of stuff,
but a few things you

1059
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,680
don't think are influencing you
are influencing you here

1060
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,360
and there all the time.

1061
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,610
Thanks very much.

1062
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:19,113
