fire
that is a time
welcome everybody
all airports always to michigan time cool he is new to the university of michigan it
fuck
well hello
you're in the right place
both at the university of michigan ann and
in this court's isn't really great course is my favorite course if you can really excited i'm really lucky if you had one notice when you're reading this reg registered course that i get to teach two sections all this course which is really exciting for me before i really is on a cellphone on a show of the eula we need to the idea of what this course is about
good
i have
see i'd he's fast five
ths huh
if
that is
four
and
and he's half
upvoted

it can be pink
if
if

or in
get it without
that five is ah was on someone's fat
this is the fourth was hired by the way to
we're always room for a while since this was a there is a
he said he's in his is too cool now who's forty one eighth one
he didn't have
it's an i'm here
one has
one
or how
one
and the are out ahead for now
it i see him
he has truly the
and if the
here
we had a hit at the pool at it will lead to tackle or heat of the the lot and i thought hands while
a fact that

right you
that is that they see as fast as

hi fi
with
hey
lockheed has a kid a it's a it's somewhat
can be so
jason things he thinks
how is he
it out of action
it is in the one he has what
this is

huh

oh that a
if
with that great introduction of the course of one adult her brief introduction
oh myself and the staff of the courts so i'm running my name's bill parker i'm a lecture in
the computer science and engineering departments on i got my ph d. from university of michigan were a lot of my research focused on security and designing heart we're like the processor in my laptop were actually using right now for the machinery and using
i top this course of a few times before this is my fourth semester involved with a course
it's really great this semester that all three lectures have actually office course multiple top so i think it's the really big semester pop and we have an amazing stats so every time i get this lecture
i stand up here and i say that the reason these course this course
goes on in such a success
is actually all the staff who supports it all the teaching assistants all the g s size for greatness students for those new to the university of michigan and i gaze on structural hate to four hundred grand
they're the ones who actually make a course at this epic take credit for so with that i like to actually introduced and let them into some cells some of us that we're here today
ah who comes to have
and we need a life
ask
that i can have in mind i'm an i'm a senior and this is my third semester teaching pounds i'm excited
i'm actually studying linguistics so that anyone out there is not thinking about maybe majoring in c s and has questions about how awful they can combine and i can copy with that
take the flak
hulu one of my name is loosely out i would put immense wound and i'll be the g is good for leagues one eighty ti vo spine
although i am majoring in sosa physics in electrical engineering and my research focuses on three the semiconductor if you wanna put anything on it this totally off course of just about the t y a few years lol and the isle of ballroom dancing and i'd do critical on half
everyone all my name's bob hi my junior majoring in math and c s is my third time teaching the course and i'm excited to meet all of you and have a great semester to get off like that in agony that hannah and damaging you majoring in c s and this is my first masters as a maintenance two birds and
i'm from wisconsin said the untied but she's come to mean the fires he adds
fuck
hi guys are lost in law is my first time in i a freeze way free time a thirty years yes major and dogs are my thirties and use play volleyball and it's resolution if
hi guys my name is isaac are they good as call me tent on the germans and undersized i'm i'm from china
and this is my first master of the idea for this course and hopefully as soon as you might just on his action a good fuck
but it'll all be max unlined senior double majoring in computer science and romance languages with a minor in business
this'll be my sixth time being it's a law office and thus gloss on that say allah some lie
edit chance to what apple pie works on the product in the alps which are two pages numbers so hopefully is use them on
also the past two weeks like conclusively road takes on the tube sites
if something's not working that's probably my fault
i can then hundred love to see all of you by discussion section
heck
very much
one of the year is a it these people in a lot more sold there are currently twenty three teaching assistants for this court so they're not all were presented a year off but why say the ones making the scores happen i'm not exaggerating
i know because i was actually teaching assistant for this course as well
as a graduate student so
five and the person you saw in the video talking about wanting the three was professor door who was taught this class for fifteen years or so but why haven't we joined by hector garcia
thanks lifted into to the point of today was receiving day is i'm going to lay out to show me what it's like for this course for you for this semester
or rest are already and what's with the like going long way for cover all of the material to i can say that comes to enlist in the website it was looked it needs one eighty three loves that right now
all in in twenty three i don't know we have it correctly
ah linked yet
war i know for sure you get a canvas the lecture slides
right so it's ok if not they are on canvas right now to win i will have the slides posted the night of four c. you can go want to news right now final lecture slides know we're gonna talk about
without that but when you are on a given to what is
it's one eighty three
so
ah in in technical courses within a very deliberate about me this and we're very deliberate with the name of the courts so this course is very happy appropriately named i've only an elementary programming concepts your break down the walls were its
so elementary so much you wanna send me that means we're starting
from basics
yes absolutely we do not expect anyone in here to have done any programming ever before if you have that's great too there's an office course to challenge you even if you had a programming course or two or three in high school for
this course will still provide challenging but
started the assumption is worth star
from the basics of overwork up to some things there it'd be pretty awesome
but you have written out certain basics might not think it shouldn't be able to do
but i guarantee you you will
ah that's
i have some stats in this lecture at all
students who sat were you also at last semester
it took this course
the last semester about sixty two percent oh
the students in coming and head
song
type of programming experience that includes pop pop one in five had taken a programming course
on actual for well for programming course in high school or wherever
transfer student
in about another one in five had taken some kind of hope on line informal thing about programming
maybe similar to what the exercises that we have for you in assignment zero which by the way if you don't know
i guess that there isn't a sign of a silencer which is due friday
it's not that involves lots
to be pretty interesting so most people don't hang out
all lot of experience
comfortable
so we asked him the money coming in and one of the things on assignment zero is asking you
aw
how comfortable are you coming in this what happened what people came in last semester about a third said not very comfortable
and only about one six eight yeah i'm on pretty comfortable here more comfort
in many real system between that shoots and leaves them
changes dramatically over the semester which i'll get to that'll show
i am actually

so start off military but i can help sneaking in
i knew this
showing you where we're really go
the end of this semester so the end of the semester
we're all going to do a major project
have a showcase
so everyone in here work on this project you will be along
you have all the staff
we three t a's in three professors who are helping you
and you have each other
swoon work on the big projects work in teams of four i don't wanna
into that now i wanna talk louder now little bit
because everyone should start off thinking about
meeting people on this class informing was in and getting to know people people would be your columns on your projects
the showcase of we have redesigned something great and implemented and show what ought to your family your friends to corporate sponsors to harness
quite amazing we do this every semester
we have four projects last of us through these projects possible will change for this semester to be announced we did created by where students
took an existing music
collection of music library of same parts
in design an artificial intelligence
she would get caught with a create new assaults in lyrics and music from
connect for lawyers are way to connect four day
that stands with taking make the game the entire game
creating nice graphical interface for also created an artificial lot intelligence
for a competitor to play against
ah let's get to learn ah i know everyone in here has registered for courts assuming they're not just wandering off the street
so everyone has experience with some something for registration who is really gonna worry access
use it
it's terror
i've really don't like wolverine access to a horrible interface
okay
just so painful to use
and the else the course guy
he isn't that much better is better
was not great i'll tell you all will react as always is accurate information
hello say course guide is someone sitting looking at walgreen access and typing what they see into the house now snake or sky
we're all
let's get to her
students who said we're so we use it now
designed and created their own websites
we're students can actually look at all or schedules
ah i decided to get to from a really really cool really slick
my favorite the arduino like her arcade
basically you take small electronic boards and wires and alley the panels can you make old school review
really cool
this is just don't want to engage probably showcase before

corporate sponsorship so are are showcase costs of money to pay dividends to a corporate sponsors that com
i can get these corporate sponsors
have higher incomes
on this course
after one semester of experience having no experience before this all out so late every time i sit down at the beginning of a showcase an actual corporate sponsors okay this is what it proves what the project looks like this is what should the sea they wanna see what they're gonna see before they see it
mate
if he had the professionals who do this all the time come in and see these projects i can't we
that person assertions to these projects
really cool very exciting experience
there's only so our sponsors from last semester
ah well represented in financial industry for thought well a little more during the lecture
fifth
but it said before internships have actually come on us
that so that the world
do more than elementary when we start with elementary
ah
when i start really basic
i wanted to show we're we're in and out
starting from scratch
programming
this is
only a course of which were bringing you a lot of programming
ah but programming isn't what computer science is actually about so this is an elementary programming concepts course really it's the first course in computer science the sight is really not solving the world's probst the news programming
as a tool to do that and up and programming is really just this break that we have between the ideas
that we come up with to solve
problems
how we can take that idea
make a program which they can
we we can use it actually
do something on a computer
that's a that's the function of programs
program is really collaborative problem solving
between a person
the computer
so people on computers
turns out work out pretty good
now
why while also get a computer computers are fast
very i asked a limited period there is doing billions of things a second
may
really accurate
usually pretty repeatable
but really stupid
okay a computer is it is dumb as a bag of hammers
okay it goes only exactly
precisely what you tell it to do
and it turns out it's kind of hard part is that is programming between what we know want to know what the machine does ah he does exactly what the programs that
carson if i ask an individual
ah pay bills obama must have passed lacks of hating you do something
in the program i give him is wrong
in stop and say all
the you want to explain it to me again i think that's wrong who's never do that
people however are really slow
it's
or if thirty so it's taken me in all a little while
most women is just to get to this point
in this pop so people are slow
inaccurate i will make mistakes
everybody makes mistakes rate we all know that
people are really not working so i spent
ah a lot of time before it came to visit and talk with us before it came to the universe in michigan for the automotive industry but a lot of different jobs including a lot of different engineering jobs then it was a test engineer one of the things i get this really have to understand is just how clever people and how accurate human beings are
care to machines
we're very inaccurate what people are brilliant
they
person
i can't understand and handle the situation which they've never done before i mean everybody in here if you have a driver's license when you were sixteen years old or know about that time you got behind the wheel car
control
compare that to the enormous amount of effort is input so far into auto driving cars the differences and leave
people are really smart when you put us together

we can have the fast and accurate nature of computers in the brilliance of human being is
that's really what you get what he combined people and computers
all before you were a further i guess someone mentioned to that of this
lecture session is recorded
so we're all on camera
amen
but according everything that's said just so you know
and this is for everyone to watch later to record the lectures and you can go back to you later this lecture we polls about canvas probably the most active it's probably it's pro super deep crop week after the end of lecture
it's available for you to go back and watch later or few miss lecture i don't recommend
that'd be here
the big issue message or whatever you can go back to you later or go back and say listen again
but
okay so i've said here and the
talk about ah computer science and one of the things i'm with a head on again and again and again which every mentioned once or twice is that
computer science
he's a programming those two things are interchangeable
reading is the tool
this is an introductory see escort mission every computer science which we learn programming ah i can say that then i'm done a lecture and i'm a
it all up here talking and you say okay i'll find what i want to convince you even more
this what to do that i'm an old video here in let people that
you forgot we all have our you know for a while
you may have no respect for
explain it to his wife

he'd been searching my mind
first got access to those who've a computer when han solo me a macintosh ninety four thousand years old has a sixth grade i am at a not shared it was that
the shit out his hands through a full of eight it hour you won't be anything
for for a that's the thing is what the war it has asked me to her right thigh i say those i have thousand low rules did and he
the news on and first for office are as you
oh here's this or heard fast is in and out is that cute
lol that on my cell
it's a a proposal room and the stupidest will do it that winds up in new bulbs about it on her the internet and go up to an israeli not only complaint and should you
so or how
it's the year
conan is i
i'm on none of his

in what is all it is that is up
this is more costs for it out holes in his high it cause it sounds it out
the that's the exact
it is for action
she found it asians in the and uses the usual and race are
lol ah or not
the house all the cities and towns i asked for but it didn't he i heard through the bible it what are the the one hundred eighteen
actually this is all over south
fourth
if
what if
if
how fun it about when she wow what a good mood
hey
it really he
and most of our group
when i was in school thousand steps school group called was too thin people found a big black betty you know it's the one below the hit is cool and the the law and you
so far as outs
the falls use lose fires it found it the whole lives of others are the people over for it happens that
yeah it the and the hottest sauce also with







it is
yeah and through that
really
it of
hey
visitors
the the

as for
where's the last
one dude from a guatemalan it or would you just want to walk to produce incredibly empowering skill to learn what if someone had told me that
saw her and i doubt he hated it at about how
oh and ends that he that he flat
you know actually
cough and a
ca in your hands up
is that exhibits so but her for what
and that
but its clay
it costs are
that's the whole route and a dude with four children
those that did him his feet and a lot it's as it runs a
oh and if the horrors of war
can you know what reptiles that so it is his clothes the us as i'm the owner's part of your home
that's it
thanks
i've
thanks
update
if
the thing
but what really don't have to ask about it
holding class to school to hear it
this is what we're here
hi do what highway
both were walnut
do they have to know when i'm at hawk about
all hail the way that perception that but calling was all along
he's sitting in a wound
save for the screen is really about scalding hot this to be sciences all
so one of the things that always like to have in this first lecture
ah his little bit on the hulk what computer science is like
no information video say what
horton are more of industry for years and i never saw had seen an office
like a knack for like post offices that weren't in the video just unbelievable but
so part of this is the new idea what computer sciences and part of the head of course
what's it like to work in computer science reality is that it's not
non of students
who study visa computer science
so all the jobs that are available
and that's the us is especially at the university of michigan
ah how
a lot of opportunity in a highly sought after know what courage of remote broadcast it to
come so we have a career fairs
are these happen usually for the science on north campus and these career fairs are unbelievable hundreds of lawyers call it lazy so you bought i encourage everyone
to go with the saints talk to recruiters find out what they want get the experience even if you not looking for a job you can just go and talk to them
happy to talk to people

highly paid
so we're still will park in that historic comeback to that
in this
discussion
the programming
his shoes every it is my assertion in our search and then of course the programming is used
everywhere now
course it's not literally everywhere
and
i wouldn't use the help of some ideas on where it's not a programming is just ubiquitous
they
on medicine
so there's a lot of medical and computing research knuckles aren't together here at university because if you're aware we have really good med school here too
really fantastic cool is aspiring to go on to med school
yes
good luck
if you really intimidating to look yeah i know when you're when you start off when you wanna go to med school
the counselors made you have an alternate half
for just in case you don't get it meant
make such limits to me anyway we do lots of research in medicine and computer science is really
all the medicine now the contact lenses so one of my colleagues in research scientists working on
tiny tiny sensors to put into contact lenses to be able to do things like administered walk home education and attack blood sugar levels
diabetics and also kind of interesting ought to enable thermal vision
contact why it's not that that's really that's
transportation is the big thing so cool has heard of self driving cars
yeah it's a big fake five policing of war we the first nation and world to actually how
hate working
i infrastructure old driver was carson think they are either about success of marine started actual testing
in the city for the us
here the university of michigan we have a
a small box city
built on north campus
where are you research and self driving vehicles so it's an entire community
just to test this
ah outlay little trouble video clip of that i have
and
huh huh
cdc and
and asked what's the moral
the simple rules don't actually work and so terms of building a real world connected vehicle system and you've got to to actually be in the field and deal with that that sensors lights you and that other drivers are not always like structures that so i say this had it written row
to force that dr
that's the saying
and they use is
so they must see
and it seems that it
and vibes it just for
the area at know it will auto open
one thing to point out all the brussels hawks about it is not talking about the challenges their overcoming is how to reprogram pets
great they're trying to overcome the real world bigger problems
saw this and programming is just one school they use
to solve problems
so we're likes to play video games of any kind
yeah i do too so whether or not you like a fresh war in the
new battlefield one
they they just came out
is like to nobody and it turned out
a few
ah
this
c s is a great king in any medium now
so dominated
by computers i
c s for social good this is something that is really happening is that is also
really now getting really hot and the avenue all computer science and programming c is for social good whether it's by creating
op
clothing that for best sudden infant death syndrome
or
a school
that allows people to discover in attracting cases on line the message really interesting too because this man next goal was developed by a hammer is a sure funded and spearheaded by a car is a stimulus called turbo which is the essentially the military us military research group
and this military research group reduce the software tool that they then report this to in fact
flying the victims of human trafficking
by searching the internet
political
this is really definitely a big thing now thought to universities in california that's not
apologies that's not you
c s this post the u s c
and the u c berkeley california both have now open
aw
actual new centers for research
in apply computer science to social good
we don't have the center for that here in michigan yet
i think that is going to change the truth really cool application of computers i
ah cool here is the lights or has ever use money
credit costs
yes the vampire it is if it's in computer science in finance
and finance employees a lot of computer scientists and mathematicians that i was born the math major in
ah phew
does lot of wrath they just take this class you must be a class that conflicts with the smokers usually vote yes usually it's alot more so
lectures a lot of times i will call out cool is a philosophy major in philosophy reason
yes
awesome that was the bullet that was the major guy to go back i'm like that and i was the regents
really great
long really enjoyable subject but
i will call she she's instances that that many of you in here
'cause i'm a size not a mathematician saw ask for verification every once in awhile to some mathematics related to the well like to call out it was on declared
ah welcome
computer science is free trade now this life of one
just say
so anyway finance he is very involved and see yes in the rough you go on not into the computer science
want to work in finance
what a chihuahua qualms all
there were two july while working with programs greater scientists
so the media for social good is another really cool thing that so from my perspective i a
existed before the internet
okay so i remember what it's like
for the past i information age
and it
once upon a time you couldn't gets
your voice out to the world
op unless you already have lots of money
so things like crowd funding revisit it exists
these things are really powerful to the cool thing happen
the futures are like this too because it was a futuristic hologram call but
the
amazon delivery drones amazon is actually a we've been cleared it
i am the federal aviation administration
drone deliveries
like it's so that's not the future earning more bets now
in fact
no
almost everything uses computers i
a we certainly will the u s c s in the air apply at all on one thing to talk about i can tell you that even say trades people like like fresh and serve bombers or or typewriters warp or players in a lot of news
besides his wife
and
is it it's
but
one thing so what do right now
safari but this is where his room when you talk about
what career
bingo
but thousands
use computers i now one of your assignments as simon zero he is to meet other people
in this course and you going to have to provide us a name in a unique name it something about three other people that you meet this'll be the only opportunity to do that but this is the only one opportunity so i'll want everybody to work in small groups it to share show us
to know which other
and toppled little bit about what careers don't you see us


okay
so let's
back together
nice to everyone is just nothing but we still have
ah more to talk about it
ah
you tube out please pay back here scenes
they you
right so i tend to wander along this ah i'm not even like turn around i can see all these books but i'm not looking at history
so the only ah electronics policy i have here is
he courteous
you're on facebook i wanna know i'm not going to the hassle you
i so can i have someone
here volunteer in tell me
e.
russian it doesn't you see us
that's a
payday
yes
i would say motive your contractor you going to use a lot of programs for estimation what ah
so you're just
a painter
maybe now
eight
yes
yes
classical musician
passive and i don't know maxim is that true or or

yeah i have a use your musician
if you wanna market yourself
they would be beneficial if you were on line
others are more hear anybody have anything yes
on this agriculture my head i
so this is i think the third time i've done this in the in like cure for this was no this is the fourth time and i love the responses i get yours i'm really really cool responses i won't mention some of the other responses because
some other responses so people could say were inappropriate but they're still be entertained one more
yes
our rec shot driver
that is amazing to live in
and yes it may be so
is it yeah
i mean i don't know how advanced for cars are
but i have it's
i've seen a couple they were never that so yeah pretty interesting
really cool air is the kind of have to go out a little more you know we're more traditional like a jerk
mm probably for a lot of pain years but not all
rashad travers probably miles
seattle out to find
ah crucible museums
ubiquitous

so are the revisit
a job market what is it like
this is like goes along with the video this is wall most when brought one million jobs may go on film
so
here's the point
ah that i wanna show everyone in here something
then you should all know
you may i'm not seeing this information before
everyone should actually no it's
solar shoulder that graphs here a minute
greed is produced in the united states a degree granting institutions and jobs open every year the new jobs or existing jobs for someone retires or leaves the job
and we have a phd in masters fashion souls years
open jobs on here enough for engineering which is close to my heart
ah it looks like
you know we're bachelor's degrees
graduates produce every year is more than the jobs every year
this is a kind of reversal of fortune
rage in recently i've just got this data on it's not showing up here and be getting caught off
i dislike the slider go online but this is wrong the us bureau of labor statistics so this is us and not worldwide
that's not a very good how
this is projected for years to call
it gets better though
so computer science now
also the green bar which is jobs is actually bigger than any of the others now here if you look at it say was hit by an almost together
would be more pleasing jobs as i actually he's because of a couple reasons are few reasons
one masters degrees are sometimes used to get more pay actors same job
racism is still a new job also we have a large component of international students who come to the us get a degree in c s and go back to their home nation and have great careers that
so actually there's a deficit here
we're not producing enough graduates to fill all these shops so that's the roasting what
not when i show you where kids lol
that is nice

life sciences
so this is agricultural sciences biological sciences
amen
that will graham
so that is again
there's a big reason there's no jobs
if
yeah
it gets worse
physical sciences so this is a part of this is an art and that's this is
actually not as bad as life sciences so this is a is a bright spot here we still just a bachelor's degrees a deficit of about to walk
they were you go
i will say in here that says we're all at the university of michigan
ah you can probably expect to outperform this national average
break
so it's not just absolutes
but it's still telling us all
okay
so now for the bad news
that is social sciences
to the university of michigan psychology is a bigger apartment
then his sciences
at university
although still ended this is
racial degrees jobs every year
so if you haven't ever seen any of this coming into college
i think you need to see i'm not trying to take a one sided picture although you might call me biased
am i am but is this just to show
read by the way they may stay
rate of course this isn't all occupations this is the sciences of various forms
the social sciences
yeah
sao
they do something
to consider
had to make your choices in life are always the disclaimer in here to say that
you always know how to be happy what to do great
philosophy is a great major
and it can lead to the wonderful wife and i know philosophers who teach at universities
oh really enjoy
really
just no
what the head winds are
that was a that because the first time
i present to the stadium which i refresh it every semester for star percent of the state
op when students submitted their evaluations so
you get to evaluate me
yes i think everyone of your instructors at university preview of university of michigan
please always do so
we value and very much by an evaluation of those fish
really angry
all that crap
very different
so say you know this is just one part of what
how old is a lot
this is what pokemon see
sigh said that her talk about it all
salary
earlier
now a half built computer science here
many jobs means higher salaries
does anyone wanting guess
what a university in michigan graduate in computer science
let's say a median it's starting salary
graduated with a bachelor's degree is any guesses
yes
sixty thousand
nine eight thousand yes
eighteen thousand and
in in back
your hand out
ah
set it up
gay
no one was signed it for playing by the price is right though you might win right
the gentleman was sitting next to you at in and out
so the law
i feel like an auctioneer here
so i'm not enough
these anymore and as of now
graduates starting salaries of bachelor's degree median salaries ninety five thousand dollars a year starting salary
the ninety eight was great on
great day
only one over so
no
ah range from fifty five
two hundred and sixty thousand dollars to start
hey this
a lotta money
so crazy
while the highest
if not the highest as men
starting median salary for bachelor's degree of university here
budapest
internships
if the two hundred dollars a month me and so i am on a register and i did research with
ah went for an internship at the hotel
and their salary for the summer was seven thousand dollars of law
also as they were going to side of the country itself even just for three months my view is a game of five thousand dollar movie bonus know the health and he's that you're taking their luggage apparently or something
their apartments
so just
sacrilege lot of internship opportunities
yeah
ah
so now we've come round
we really believe in programming and i guess all those salary isn't exactly related to programming so we got a little sidetracked was in fact he eats one eighty three concepts
so it's awful for both programming grudgingly concepts to the machine to the to make something that takes our concepts the weekend actually op do something good will peace
on outcome hard work
we talk about concepts
in this course in in computer science will really talking about our algorithms
now i'm going to op
actually this point
again be a little
lazy in this and let's
the video explain to you how did but
i have
if
this
and how
huh said i accept it and you lose you the loans though
where is that a lot and you tube
well through and you want high and your
wong see the
that
but that's it right
he had so for her
let me see
ruth was a room
sad and the law
to this to quell and laos is the other at all and it was signed your
this is the sunday and out
it is that it is i ain't you after all we start homeopathy
on his or her and a us
involved in
once the martha stewart who see things that were somewhat on to hint at peace and we
the last this long for you thought that out
the it it was a lot of free movie
this is that is saying is that this story zero
these things in the room
it while
nasa's home
cliff
was that it
does it work there are cheating where lindsay in my own way as the as bruise you will we get in a while so for for whom the the hands you a lot of us that that's the idea they didn't want it it's a lot of sounds and then this is what he says it will still want to
all out war movies is errors you are you
as i hate that
the only issue and the
this ah but what if he drops it is it worth the work is raise your own
it's the people
so all right but what i find it she says the one how futile it is the i want to work on isis said these or what happens in war say it's all his classes that muslims a home and it it a
and your roof hair and
sit in the balls and healthy
crews and rat was all i use it now see that's all
is this place is that's the last with rats what state is that our our t v one room
what we use life is it i pay it all and it might seem is is it is the the houses are people so the at your or your own
in my moi
his life his hand will have to think the author and
and raise your view have found it a lot more
what if there are three feet long
i saw that
let's see what
asia and use it for a payout of the the the red and white see that there is a low her own room so what's the long are lots of what is included in the simpsons rat eighty is is the only reason has the most is this
but i
when a movie
are you scared what was it equals in boston
the one who reins on payer sit in the hills and was so i saw the lobby and i were and if
what is it grants that he's in one person that i care about
isn't that good
wall of real and learned room
is it a
the net
it has the fourth wife has found you
good day
if it if it's something we saw
the the floor
whoa whoa
read all along
what is the way to do
there are dark complexion and you will hit
it it it's on
things you can do to succeed the scores
where gonna say is the outer rhythm
is one of the walls to warrant steps in fact it is a vital step
it should have
to cross in this course
don't forget caught
developing your how were the sole province will give you a problem to reprogram on
you have to figure out how you solve that problem and the launcher figured out how you're going to solve the problem
then you can think about how like going to break a single little bit
soft rock
and if you wash
just go to the keyboard and start typing cold out
he can get pretty bad you need to back yourself and to really nasty or
so the algorithms that developing your algorithm is really important
doubling so i'll point out the video that are probably a little more subtle
while one thing he isn't that they were looking
for better how that we do this all the time
one of them are hungry
that one big thing in computer science that we're always doing the other thing that you really super important and really super relevant to this course
fact that they were testing their algorithm and they were thinking how bout how do we test so highly testers solution
to see if it actually works
testing is you really important and i can guarantee you were really limits fast
things the cold that you all right
so since one of us you should definitely do it to talk talk more about the futures will point out how points
now we we measured be
hi i'm complexity
all wishful we call this we analyze how long it types to solve problem
all these algorithms of the first one is
everyone what i want one two three
four or five six great pretty slow
emery extra person in arizona and you have to find more twice as many people idiots with a twist on how
we'll do better year
coming by payers the fixing it began
but still
use of the small
we've caught the time it happens a lot of people will what can i count everyone at the university
we're one of the states
every one of the country forever on the world
ah i combine chooses a very efficient there's better ways we can do this
what are the do right now
actually so everyone in here i was just end up
what were the two boys were and how often number of people in the room i finally did not including the power and this is everybody is getting right now
he is represents one like one person you know find someone else and standing
you had your two numbers together is the first round bill and it's it's you and i'm one of these will sit down
an ideal to that again to do this for it's also for them to lose but one person standing in this room
cool out because of the people of the room
oh

if
and how
i had
if
if
if
i just want to be black
if
east



right we have a house

three thirty eight
three thirty eight
that actually i think thank you very much
actually i believe
is probably pretty accurate
your three hundred
and it's ten people registered for this section just before the section and i think that there might be more people in here is anybody was not registered for this section by the doubt by the rules
okay so
the three thirty eight so little much
for not quite perfect
lots of facts was a whole lot faster
that by just one around the room or anybody else i mean i'm sure someone to do it faster want
two
and i can tell you i have helped a bit
people in this room
before
it takes less multiple paths to actually get in and today we could just read
that happens when we do the same
by the way
so yeah that was actually much faster
the flu are coming one by one
and pretty accurate too
now what is this look like this now we just did it looks like the green line
and this has long were the complexity
now what the great things about that is if we don't hold the number of people in the room with
re
it would only take one more step
she actually count everyone
if really much more powerful
fun fact if we had a thousand people in the room anybody wanna tell me
at most comedy or comedy stuff so we take guess
flawless
getting closer
then yes it would take offense that
much faster really powerful and the the kind of algorithms you wanna go
i can also use this algorithm
on something like
this
this is a dictionary for those who are not seen one in in paper form
cool possesses a dictionary

it had anyone not seen a physical dictionary before
sooner or later and get someone raises their hand
as awake long enough
hot dna eight thirty am class
i asked him who who possesses a dictionary and someone said i use the internet
which is what we use out of this
so this the cherries older than i am a pet for quite a few years i'm sure he's actually use it to look up words the fall want to look up something in the dictionary
something hassle and the t h i n g
i could start really getting contents portraits of the presidents of the united states
op webster's new world new world dictionary
for work okay i'm not even to war general abstract nope but he later
nope
action
nope
there is something the back
or
i could start
in the middle

rather
one thing rather close now
the closer
by taking split that in half
every time i can convert quite quickly to an answer
is eleven hundred and seventy six
pages in this stage yet already memorized i did this this morning
although
which would require
how many at most
eleven yes
they let him in fact
he's dictionary had a billion
pages
i would take at most thirty splits
for a follow when i was looking for
presuming i can split a billion page dictionary
which i'm just going to ignore that for right now
that much much faster
i hope it
so at this point
i have a novel little bit about elementary programming concepts we've wandered a little wave of far away from elementary to show were in and out of the course and programming we talk about salaries abilities would wander we've talked about elementary programming concepts
this
and the section
all are the part of this lecture weren't talking about computer science and algorithms and what
they nominate talk a little bit about the nuts and bolts of what it's like
in this class
smiling as they get excited this is a great class is my favorite
class
to teach i'm really glad to teach you to give the semester
love taco what can be like forever but it
discussion section is
so
if the university we have these wonderful things called discussion section by saying that's kind of mocking him away because some courses caution sections are just the way
for you get more class time
palm
and not have to have to teach
not this
discussions sections are huge asset in this quarters
certainly the discussion section so i'll talk about what more about the women we have three different kinds standard
no experience some experience lot of experience whenever you leave home there

less comfortable no prior to it so
everybody in this prominent have any experience those two will have the same
exact material so we have to cooperate and all sections you will work in more detail and depth in much more hands-on
the cheerios and lecture
and of course
ah more comfortable
is out different challenges so more comfortable you're not going whole were the exact same things is a luxury long lecture
ah you're going oh you gotta be doing
how much more advanced than us for those who have a lot of experience in programming
she devil yeah it's crazy programming
tackle that
all all but two were standard one was comparable one more comfortable
you're allowed to go to for discussions actions
okay
cause nobody would ever lectures you can come to light a thirty or fifty want you can visit one of the other two cats
whatever fits in your schedule so long as we can fit in the room this room would get lots of space
great discussion sections of the same you register for discussion you like whoa i got
i have two one across campus to get here
hello
these discussions about all
i really believe that that's all they're great with what they're much more and we have over three hundred people in this room by any measure
discussion section to afford it
he lot more calls experience with your colleagues in the course in with the person have different discussion have taught discussions for this course and i'm walt teaching discussion is the school is really a wonderful experience for everyone and wall
ah
more hands on experience you can be working together in groups to solve problems to halt or understood the warp practice
you get to know the staff
it's really great to know the staff
they will be your best friends in this course i guarantee it
they're also really super friendly
wonderful op ed your peers that's very helpful to form partnerships the first two projects before
projects in the semester one big showcase project
first to project you have to work
hello
the next two pleasure to work with one partner the final project thou shalt working groups of four
so it's good to get to know people
casual through the semester
this is really relate to be engaged so hot in addition to my research on computer security
ah an architecture also the research on learning
in the teaching and learning in engineering or computer science and teaching learning learning
if you're engaged
the good work op
quite a splash
we don't take attendance so it's entirely voluntary that's why i'm so
encouraging
cause i got a swim an online book called timeout say
i'll believe it i'm sorry it's not free
there is the instructions on how to roll of course website the twenty three on war
it's reading with song short answers
called black
this is practice
small pint sized chunks of calling problems we're given a problem you come up with an algorithm you break it to go when you type in your code you had an error and it says law
yes to go back to figure out what she did wrong
really effective it can be frustrating
really useful
i cook or who use back quicker before
cool like cyclic
aw brilliant pocket
i love it and this course is going to use it during lecture and i think that you'll enjoy
try to make it
more enjoy
ah they just questions we asked during lecture is only part on your part of your points for your great
as well
more details about that muscles
so one thing i wanna say please
reid
the syllabus
many questions i'd get
my answer will be
it's a soulless
results results so just cannot away result is a lot of very useful things in there too
if you don't all
to make this semester hard
really great website as maxim said thanks to maximum he can say that it is something wrong it's his fault
it is if there's something there
it's 'cause he did
and
i'm in zero to friday
all the third one point just ignore that is not supposed to be there have been shifted to the next assignment this time is available on the course website do you do you view it you right now

me is that this is really more so this sunday hats
six pm right here how convenient
when i have made this that i won't be here
what's the teaching assistants well and so they can give you honest answers without the year
and it just to get to know
everybody
also after that they're gonna help you
get up to speed on the tools you're gonna need visual studio for pc next quarter back
to accomplish you work in the scores
really know what the recording back to smell also be available
of course scheduled to achieve everything you need to know
like your tools this is recorded by slides around why are the set
the access
if you're needing assistance you go on merit not register for this
this is the first place you go
wait you have a question do yachts
you can post questions you can answer each other's question is too that's fine
great opportunity to get your question answer in the quickest
manner possible if you email me with a question about an assignment
i know exactly how long it it beats me get it
the op
if
ah this ours
if you knew university and especially if you're new to
programming courses you're use office hours are lots
office hours are a big feature the course
we office hours monday to friday three atm except on tuesdays only tool sex with him is that the insects
rama to our stats you can look about
i'm a tawny owl back
fine if if you don't know on north campus apologies for the trip
you can take a boss
bomb apologies for the boss
actual losses that is really good here ever since i lived in ethiopia
and had to get around awesome op in ethiopia
i can never actually complain about the boss isn't an armory
okay
great place to get one on one health
talks
so last few minutes how will we visit
i'm really important things
we you can see
what the students from last semester
their experience in this course and this one for mueller your experience is going to be
these numbers are almost for a lot the same every semester
sixty two percent were unfamiliar this is we asked when when everybody leaves the end of semester was asked to fill out a survey of what was it like for you here
overall
honey rate declined
now
these are really super good for the technical courses usually those numbers for our overall ah yeah
aren't that high and keep this in mind when you see the hours of work low
sharking just the man
not right now in fact
we're close
people really like the course
but it's a lot of work
plan ahead
this is not course you just i'm going to work on com the lecture come in and take the exam
did you go
too little homework
no
so were qualified as though this little slow
ah five percent safe now much work
was that mean
we're three hours
how much time the pistons last semester it spent in this course
ah eight percent said zero five i don't know how they got to this course in
under five ah yes legally
this is weekly average
yes
not daily is that they are but it is a weekly
by the ten hours of learning
ten fifteen hours another third
and we have one in five people
actually spend at least fifteen hours a week on average pretty heavy work well
also know that
i have a very bad penchant for running all week so five thirty
challenge
lots of town
lots of support lots of effort lots of challenge lots of support
people love it i enjoyed this course even with all the hours
very positive
the goal to recommend this course they recommended that one slide in particular lectures i work on that each semester and lighting up that far slowly a few percent each year that five goals so my goal was to have a whole layer discussions people like discussions with life
if
that we have lots of office so
we're here to support you
this is the graph about like the most
in its
stones leading this course i was comfortable in the twenty three as i am in a way other classes in any subject here a few of them
while one in five said no
everyone else said it
yeah
we're yes
really
so with that stuff
is tied thank you and i'll see you on thursday thank you
