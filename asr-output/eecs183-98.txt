we're buying
darn it
it is michigan i
welcome back
i see we are still light bulb
let him make this count everyone again busy
we get the same call but now it's encouraging to see
this place filled soul
the school
back for thursday so each lecture
ah i'm usually have some announcements at the beginning
little bit of room you from what we did last time and it will dive into the topic of the day to day
that is the simplest was a little walk and i take heart he's like he's our first program
hello world
before i get started on that i want to call attention
to a organisation that he is ah very involved in
huckabee resides intellectual engineering and he is of course everyone in here now
is at least four times if you want to be an aspiring computer scientists
so i you i'd definitely welcome but there is the girls electrical engineering and computer science organisation
ah
very involved in campus like especially on
i am more north campus of like filler during the two sides with everyone in here has also invited
having meeting
next tuesday
ah six thirty p m soul and after class without its tuesday i encourage you if you want to know ah what might be like to be
a computer science great place to find out there's lots of activities of a hat you so i've heard you to go
op and and see what it's all
if
assignments zero is due tomorrow
i checked this morning before the third election is all about me he would take us six hundred people on nine
hundred and
seventeen or so registered for the courts had completed most of us find one
our side zero i'm sorry if you haven't got a they have to look tomorrow
to complete it please do so
i wanna start off on a good book with points
you know what muscles point so one of the things that i encourage intercourse and in the exam
this is getting a little bit of advice on the outcome we have the exam is
other goal in salem is too keenly as many points as possible before the
as we have the same goal of course the bullet points passion by
there is a non trivial number of people who get to the end of this court is just me and another seven points
just another seven points for different great fish nine points on the sign
so so much passion by

meat is that this sunday a six o'clock right here
i really interesting
any of the recording just in case you can't miss it by encouraging because
you will also help you
the ceo laptops
i think it started with installing
which would appear to the malls we
up to speed on tax code
ah from all apple will go sightseeing here
ah but they do also help with visual studio
i suggest
when you go on for you go
look back and getting started with visuals to your getting started with tax code documents that we have on the course website
wonder ah resources
there are those documents and i'll take the step by step through installing are getting ready to start working in this class easy to get beforehand before you go get some help know you might not need help war
you might be a lot further ahead
is anybody not look good eats one eighty three dot org website
good
that's good
he going back there's always announcements lots of resources
is anyone not read the soulless yet
he came in minutes
a few brave souls please read this illness lots of good information
discussions sections are already started to go
fiery talk about that whole lot less
office hours start next monday
we have the block three atm three six on tuesdays this is a great way
she gets won won how we're to talk about subjects do you live deeper understanding war to get ill be problem you might be having
the you can ah figure out yourself on a program on a project or asylum or whatever are really good resource
and people come in just pass
the staff
is it like to work an apple or what's it like a two five for an internship with it might need to be is is that you're all kinds of stuff
get lots of questions and and
we want to do so
ah i will also help office hours in the panel this will be there to the office the group office are sometimes but i have office hours at ten thirty two eleven every tuesday's in eighteen thirty seven these all
you can come in ah computer projects or if you wanna talk about something more personal or whatever
stop on
the slides are available right now i'm close to them last night
ah i'm in the course website so you can find these other resources to serve you want to have them in front of you during lecture
their their wars reference later

so when i start with so little bit
history
is a
really old computer finished in nineteen forty six the first
general purpose
on digital computer cities you can apple computers to the nobody had a
a remake an echo of the way
so we having him a class of time we've we've had this policy you can use the same thing here at work
yeah he's a computer you can use a calculator are already in that
nothing electronic
people have mechanical calculators if you can
for pre complex occupations on my list and asked me to use it
fuck it
stop watch the file it is
when the acquisition i came to view the this room by white march
and there may be easy made all hope
ah
vacuum tubes
i know what's
and why years in real ways and originally the real computer scientists were all like to college years hand
titian isn't that all that was the first digital computer little computer science
there's a piece of this machine and a piece of history today that sits in the lobby going into the bottle ready
the easter building
so all in ah north campus is directly across the guy i got there the north
ah the diagonal of campus for almost two years and it'll pop sources weasel word check it out
pretty cool
in this all of the original programmers are actually win
for six or seven programmers to prove innocence higher computer everyone of them
was a wall


to hear is hard all the terminal ball
they won a reference to compute
the bodies when something goes wrong
there are all kinds of different dogs they're saying is that called blue screen of death
ah or we need people spinning wheel a little cooler spinning wheel on apple would never goes away
what a blog is when it when it does something
didn't want to do that
it turned wild comes from the first of all the files so on these massive computers were just always going warm tubes and wires
and relays
no it wasn't working on
so a prolific computer scientist named grace murray hopper
oh and he had a lot of firsts
beer science that the first compiler people talk about that today autopilot but
anyway she found the first bought this problem
she was the final of promise find interesting it down to 'em off
for all been in short it helps
wires on the computer
the soul in the report so the problem
she took the dog
take it to the report
it was about so that
is worded terminology for bob comes from
impromptu computers
fact
last time
it's awful lot about how that is
algorithms
specific pro we come up with the soul
problem
we demonstrate some algorithms of counting people there we saw the video we saw the one by one one two three
really small
cause like there's two four six
so slow
and then we did it's
like having a problem with each step of the way
falling into a whole lot faster
different algorithms of course they have different fish and sees and speeds but as we saw the video that also have a different pitfalls that the mayor how were the more complex who went from coming everyone accounting every other introduce more chances for a year is
we want to be as close to the bottom line so time is all
size of a problem

this graph is ah that is no
little ambiguous hear his own view is
you receive a
or like this that has
no measure on the axes that's just the picture that's not an actual court but at least we have what they were patients of units here seconds and you'll sigh is a problem
ah this could be good for how to make but basically you wanna be on the head and is actually our lot worse than
the n y
one of these calls of law that possible something interesting there's actually algorithms that we use
so look up credit cards that are constant high
when holly crap for two days
so it takes to say what time the shack
were your credit card number
whether you're at enormous thank for small cost of time
the matter what the size of problems
we're not even do that
people wanna take more c s classes was really interesting thing to wear
pseudo code
pseudo code is
really
import so the talking about the following is kind of entertaining
re least i think it's kind of entertaining
optional code is something that is very functional and i encourage you
she uses
but talk last time about this idea that we help
for problems us all
make it bigger sizes also had problems then we think those are algorithms how we might solve that problem
while we're thinking of that we need to think about fantastic
as well test our algorithms but then we need to transform that into something that can run on a machine
the first step in the transformations bring it down its to go there is no way we're also hopeful c plus plus has strict rules on how we knew offs for our c plus plus programs that pseudo code is it
we don't have a rule book for high your rights to go
you want to be concise so when you're writing down your ideas you don't write down
there are perhaps because it's harder to see the whole thing
a larger chunks in one go to a to be concise yet express really important
most people
your position would skip this at both in the bottom idea
most are really cool
step back like this to go and you wait this out it's easier to see you know words
if you have any gaps in your logic is he in c plus plus any gaps in your logic
this you know your own words better right now the music box office
we look this up to go to the video last time
let an equal zero so here we create a
are you will
all i can
so we're creating this thing we can accumulate the cop for the room and
blue
the last thing we are seeing that lucas is really
very powerful so
sheena the we all have
and you billions of operations in a second
i've written a lot of call with serving nowhere near billion lives of coal there's five million lines of code in your operating systems give or take
so
oracle really fast if we don't we use its we reuse it through hoops
for each person
when you see for each is an actual construct it's used in some programming languages but when you see the word for
you know you could do things again and again and again in the c plus plus values for
some groups
then we're gonna set this for a woman we've created an
people too and costs want
sword anchor metabolic new one and
ah one thing though is very top notice how we explicitly said then
two zero this is critical
you have to do your programs to all wise it's not an easier
should make its you to start
but something else was at the wind it's highly right now was there for about
yes
the indentation is invented bizarre sign is a visual cue
it's a subset of the thing in products so we see that it here op this
is within the school
all the blue
we have
that is how we can differentiate just looking at the pseudo code
it should go away when wanna do something after week out everybody
they will want and maybe that's actually how everybody not the same thing while we're talking every step
i also want to encourage all this i'll just give up here and gas on an entire
not sure i have no problem just talking
ah if you have a question
feel free to ask soul you know raise your hand
i try to keep an eye out if i don't respond
they can always make it my attention
don't mind people asking questions of all
bob
i'm not perfect sometimes they say something is not as clear as i'd like it to say what seems clearly maybe
or any other
it's best to ask a question rather than just pass it on
they
all my questions of all i apologize in advance if you ask a question and i say
that's getting ahead
that's to advance of the topic so you'll lose sight line for office hours are after lectures on
apologies in advance but we still have to move on i don't wanna troll to the pilots hop
before we get some rest too so that you free
that's it
testing this is something i hammered last time testing is absolutely critical when you lay out her out with a pseudo code think about how things go wrong horse think about what she needed to test
so we saw on their outer rhythm going by one i worked ok we tested by counting to people the task of my colleagues zero people
this is so which are calling age he's fantastic
when you design your coding you're going to have to wipe test cases for projects to three and four
to test your own code
if i guarantee you most people will get frustrated at some point doing is just buy it
think about when you design your opportunities kind of things accounting zero people are rules
or if we're counting people of rome
think about what happened we counted ten thousand people
make this room can hold ten thousand people but all the rooms can form a lot of caught the number of people in the big house
it's what's house that they will encounter real world
great so think about those kinds of things with your chest
to wit time that seemed okay if they were referred to it worked for zero pablo
those were freaking hot though
that's a pro
do you think about testing
as we go all the time
condition
i always loved conditions were not
we're not getting dizzy plus plus conditions that police will what we do just that the g choice by law they have to wait that was wonderful when you have choices in your code to so we fix this
i say if one person on it
then do something notice again the invitation told us how we said if we invented it back home for
so we're not gonna check that condition every time we help of a person rumbling to we don't entirely first
right cause everyone we're
then at the very end
we're going to see it
there he is one person i've had one
that's
brings us to call
so we have ideas
the developer algorithms right arm so vocal think about how we're protesting we look and see it as this although probably want us all then we got transform that
into cold but we say cold we really mean is the source code

source code is an algorithm express enough for winning language
so read or write source code in c plus plus
hey
i assume a lot of people did the our vocal exercises already
yes
yes the way enjoy the hour of coal
get it we enjoy it if
ah
yes one picking out the exercises and we actually enjoy doing
it's interesting that you wanna
click and see walk all all the actual ah a text cold is represented by the blocks that you had to get

i wear earplugs this kong so the tutorial hobbies these appear again because i think it's important

he started with your liking
anyone tell me what i mean he stands for
if
yes
making the integrated development environments that means
tax code for all apple sells i see out there
and visual studio that wonderful beautiful pieces laptop
amongst other windows machine
these documents are there right now
he gets up
this is what tax code tax there looks like
make this is a simple hello world program so this is what a tool on the video would watch
of all the really really successful super rich people
ah talking about their experiences in computer science
and gave you all from now
this is it the year when you saw the whole world
you just blown away
odd
i have to admit it was a little more exciting
we have cell phones and laptops and video games is some of these all are more exciting things but it's still really cool with you
make the machine too soft
may not
it's something someone else did to make a machine guns
so what happens
we need an integrated development environments because we can
take c plus plus code and she entered into an intel processor the intel processors don't understand c plus plus we need some intermediary
does all this transformation from one thing to without its called layers of abstraction
great works track it away
what it takes for the electronics are machines to make pixels wide
thankfully
although wise would take one time to do anything so there's something called the fundamental theorem of software engineering
kind of a observations show but still relevant but not the goal
that is that
the problem can be solved by adding another layer of abstraction
except for too many layers of abstraction
so we get our ah
our algorithms put them in the pseudo code delaware source code
then driving easy for them to this thing called the compiler
you get to know the compiler through the ayers picture the one you get your projects trust me
you're waiting years everybody to us
a compiler creates a single object code and that is what the intel processors for arm processors or any in any processors on thursday
it looks as a representation of the
it it's just
wineries just ones and zeros on or off
and this sequences
are understood by the processors this is what we eventually get from your application is
okay
either a question is what we wanna start accepting yes

i see
that
so what if very sharp very observant so question is you live in this tiny text i apologize it's hard to see what's out there in hello world there's this little splash in
that is actually a character that cause a new law yes it is so characters
oh what they did it take to characters in this lecture but characters go beyond shots
the alpha numeric characters were used to and they can represent other things like the lines and the file
in all these other things too
so that's all ways to make a carriage return will see another way
to make a character turn up here and are often today
very observant sure
the question is
yes

yes
i'll get to that sought gynecologist and is one of the work of a quotation marks all the result of evelyn waugh we start talking what data types of it
okay so
i want you to wimbledon and yet
yeah i think it'll it'll clear when we get a yes

thanks
i love your question
so
the question is do we need in all this terminology for attacks
the answer is someone that i try to point out as a goal wall especially things are really important to know i usually stressed if you see the same term whole our whole word over
it's probably something you should know
you may be tested on an exam for terminology
so i long to put across words in exams
usually i make the exams
so
just be known
how do the crossword with terminal which i try to point out
what's important what's not
if i don't look for when it comes again and again
the system in the one question is
i usually point that out election
they usually stress that i haven't done it yet and now i'm guaranteed that i have
right hello world program here we see it again
this doesn't have the slash and so we don't have a new line here or here but here is
what we can run right now our ids are machines
on a break this down
he's like he's sort of talk about what each line is
i would introduce
also what do you like we start doing i could respect tuesday
we're actually the next tuesday
we have questions like this
so right now i'm just gonna pass for new look to get over
and which is why enough
is actually the program began
actual program where it started
anybody wanna say yes
yes
my aim for
any other
guess it's
yes
why why any other gases
yes
live by
i
so
the first guess was actually correct line for is the start of the program
that is our program called the stuff above it's the stuff is going to send us all
to actually be able
to have a program out into what polls lines are so hopefully will make more sense once i explain what those two lives up there are
genevieve than the two
okay
so i've been drawing on now for er
while thirty eight minutes so on and try to work into lectures
short rate is
two minutes for you
should not have those innovate and just think about war
chat with someone about we've talked about
aw or whatever you wish
i do this because researchers shown is actually really good
to remember we've talked about much
face




if
thad



and





okay so it's about time probably long gone
so let's take a car what would be a first program
it would tell me what this program down
if
the the it doesn't do any work i mean it burns energy
you'll you'll run but it will produce any results
does not
faye
so in in c plus plus we must have a functional tool down
next thursday
on what functions on
warnings or point out now is it with a goal for austin and give us a
you awful lot of things so it can get some read in looking at these topics and i couldn't really down deep on many of them today
so what kind of a bigger picture of you
and then will spend lectures and you know coming off drilling down on the individual things so you know some of this is gonna feel like it's breeze the work but this is the first generation of ways of information
they're going to be thrown
another thing or encourages this was not as active for today before today you can be perfectly honest i was watching the ah
okay
i encourage everyone to do so out say
for the lecture before the lecture that they get answers whole lot of questions i think you're much more prepared
so i think he will be the local food for you if you
two
maine
others functions which are just
pieces of cold it logically fit together
break you don't write an entire operating system in one file in one go make five million lines so far apart so we break it up into pieces
these pieces are functions
maine is the name of this function
shall always be one main c plus plus i guarantee on about project rerouting here is because you have to file simple have a main you can only have one that has a name
is this a duplicate simple
you have to make us warn you now
there can be only one
who's the highway
you
somebody
those one person in the movie thirty lecture to it seemed
hi
anyway they can be only one way
fallon hassle this
something that always causes
the whole lot of confusion envoy
okay boy in here in this function
some value hasta it's all function think though auction of the dishes
break
rip to shame
we take two numbers in return a number was here at four absolute value even so
sake of value
find out the absolute value of a return the absolute out
here is fourteen means we're not taking anything in we don't need anything
in this function to do we wanna do
great starting from the top
there are other ways which we can get input besides that avenue right there
boy in the mayor's really important point
bullying is not synonymous with zero
there was a thing his numbers represent a representation
all the countess year
void is
nothing
not zero
absolutely not there's just nothing better
return
when you're performing something
when you doing in tax
if they come to an end sooner or later hopefully if you don't it's called an infinite loop that's another problem and how
in your code
when you get on with this function here this main thing
wanna go back
all can somewhat all asked me this
operating system make you you see always in this class it probably means operating system which example of an operating system is when does that
right
awful s isn't the case of rain so you're operating system is managing your computer when you when your program one name is john
then he gets in school back to your computer
in your your programs though so will we see the rich
you always want a return
ah value
so the return is this signifies earth we're done here
leave this function go back where we started
when this function started
where ever we came from one's function start
zero
zero he is of value to your sending back late in the case of maine it
we're just going to return zero that's a signal cold to your operating system that everything is falling
next five years
to see here nothing was wrong trust the ratings good bass with zero hits
if you return all the things in fact if you're reading a function for absolute value
which for me
the absolute value of the number that you started
here when i have zero why do we have zero
because our function said it
that's the return to fight
look into which is what it is an minutes with important thing is that these must match and types
i'm not really drill now
i'm types
one thing is that those two things must have it
hi
this is important issue for cultural standpoint
no it's the end of the statements semi colon not call in which you will to fight sometimes indian hair
not period
why don't we use the period to an estate likely to winning
any guesses yes
and
will like someone
did a group of the

worth
it is

that's a good shot at that is a good reason but it's not the specific reason we don't use a period
say was no period is amazing and semi colon could mean something comes after
but in this case
going after it is the end
yes
math that's why we don't use a period ended
you know who is this statement if we get paid
double returns by a return
while one point one
we if we bought the point was
if it's exactly so
don't forget this i'm like oh i say this in vain it because sometimes you will forgive some like cause of the understatement this causes really weird here's a new programs because all it does it just keeps walking funny and everything after that just keeps get added to this statement
which causes grief
so to get some air you looking at the high is the same this is a problem
go back seat like this i'm like what op so i
for this
curly braces or something we're going to get real familiar with
squat
that you know what's the school
so we look is hopeful little mittal regular algorithm where we're looking at accounting now run over people
we saw the invitation
told us something about the school work we want it you would say are you
we're going to use here to save us plus he's curly braces what that says is for this function of thing called main
everything that's associated with maine is between the two curly braces that follow
top law
talk a lot more about scope as we go through
semester
huh
yes


huh
oh okay so where else might you use really brackets like this
four and yes they do so for conditional
it was on a previous operate them yet
more than one person remains then have one to the cow
that initial set of using an indent
which we would use in it and we can see this is invented here
we would use curly braces for that as well
but
what
hello multiple things can have school associate with functions condition also moves
those things will all have school
and that way we can hack more than one thing to do it
may we might have many lines of code wanna put it here so so so they take a band of this we want more than just returned want the curly brace
half
ah the statement
prince hello world to the standard out
so sad about what is the the little console window
with the terminal
we're isn't
seen its height on
terminal
before yeah it's pretty integrated in ah max
it's no more familiar with those who don't use it as much i would say
ah but we're abusing it here in this
gold what whirlwind
this war is steve young
and this i'm like whoa see ya
this represents cold with someone else has written and given to us so we don't have to read all the code to change pixels on the screen
make this proxy out
it's inheritance from the c programming language
of which c plus plus was was so
the successor to view will almost yi is still
stream we will use
in the world that all your operating systems are written in the c programming
more fish

the answer to the operator for a taco operators today that just takes
ah programs that performs some operation on them
hence operate
these are insertion operators insertion operator is a term that you're gonna have to become familiar with and know what it means
hello world strange little world
this is also very important terminology of string is just a series
paul
alpha numeric her
a forecast the characters if you're familiar call with that will get familiar with more when asked
the series all these characters are called strain that only this one change of
but nothing's gonna change the strain
when you when your program that spring is to remain constant

the wealthy and wise so we saw
ah so so most of the observers noticed that there was little splash kenya
the american the strain that's one way because in new line
foster for many men through special character
right this is another way
and this will just cause a character turn
let anything we pray to the turmoil after that would be on the next line will start in
yes
for c out ah i see our wally use for printing to determine
that's only use it for
and will use it in various ways then you'll see that as we go to the semester
so for right now we're just gonna pray to the show
yes but
ah
what would happen if we left off the return zero
is anybody wanting guess what would happen
yes
pal air any other gases
yes
one time there
any other guesses
yes
the walls not
any other guesses oh they'll crack
your own world
the reason you're all wrong is only because all this function a unit
your compiler your id
is smart enough to say that
four main you have to which learn something and i just blew us all that she was a return zero
so your compiler will just got in there for you anyway at least most compile saw the compiler than ever with a machine here
well
it's a dangerous thing
go for os to count on that because really what would happen if you get a compiler
if your compiler wasn't making up for your mistake or maybe it's
'cause here were saying it's main were saying we're gonna we're turning in nature
be it a lot want your compiler really hate use honestly
you're gonna return an image
you lie
so if remain i'm just gonna assume you want to
and in fact most of us for writing this will just go with this and it'll just be filled in for is only for main hall or functions you will give you a compiler yes
those requests to get any other function of maine your compiler is almost assuredly going to be with here
unless the returns like his voice
then you won't get near be
it is still going to just say oh you messed up at the bottom off of a return statement for you
otherwise if you were turning in a major in its not mean it's gonna think you made a mistake because you promised to give us a number i can get to the number you wanna get
with main writing guess you're gonna say remains on
that's what happens to combat it says guessing
your attention
warning compiler it gets your intentions sometimes to try to be hopeful
this is great for your coat wrong with you make a call when differently between your apple laptop and we can pilot on the auto great
warning
try to be explicit always
i know it it's an interesting part of why the program is not certain what what
counting clue
this is the directive it tells the pre processor grey trousers deftly not turn you need to know
it just the information of how this works equally go with someone else wrote for you
your welcome
don't
or even included i mostly i will stream is the cold is someone else wrote so we can use c out
wonderful
using a space dandy
this is an agreement
on what we're going to say between your program
and i'm alive for it you might use
whoa what words mean
so it's like a dictionary which are also going to agree upon
what particular words mean example of that in this case you see out
great see how to use this word is you lose in ohio streamlined were a thing for you use that word to you need to use this
there's something called the name states which is the definition of what games are high too so now when you say see out
after you put put this thing with it's ha now he knows that all classes see out the i have been idle speed
we're good i can just go use their co knows what to do these two top lines or something i would refer to as boilerplate
was a total loss school
while replace
is the thing that you just always include
thank you see it when you pop a click here agreements high near dual iphone agreements or whatever
i had to purchase boilerplate things so be used always have to put in their you put this on your own if you forget it you're going to get
or is that you try to compile
oh yes
if are there other men's faces yes there are a and you can make your own
this along with that one
yes
name's been so the question is names based kind of like a class so
when you started it kind of like a class
i guess that is the
ah ah how you view would kind of thing i would do it more as the is the mapping some means what to remain
should be so it's almost like a dictionary
two separate languages would share
to share works
more so than i would say it's a class
i have
haskins into the implementation to
implementation details of how you like cold and structure called instincts rather than the war or conflict so
ultimately there's classes that implement these kind of thing
but it's not like a cop
okay
which state with friends all
anybody want to say which one is
yes see
enhance
steve
why not
c is the correct answer all what's wrong with the first one
missing the quotation marks we might mistake that will come for a variable except it's got the exclamation point at the end
what's wrong with me

there is a growing the wrong way that is not an assertion operator that's an extraction operator
what gets him

what is wage and by one is wage this
what is a pc
for jihad you knew full time to molecule will for i asked for an answer
so i believe
i believe you had your hand at first
it's all about yes the correct answer is the fall of the law
it is a very
we're top of variables and just a minute
that means that here is something that we can change the value on
as we go lol
off to represent a particular memory location
right what we use c plus plus
one of the things we compile this is we're going to say okay here's a piece of memory
in our eight gigabytes of memory there weren't any case
or when ah animals i am twenty because we made a whole the twenty through the initial as asian
ferrero the name for something accessible location in memory of stores of value to that location
so is just repeating what we were just talking about on the previous law
it's also hit with this might look like so i guarantee you that is to go through the semester you're going to see
this
representations lines
all the more times than you might want to
on the right-hand side is is abstract model of memory
in our machine rape and we have every pot it's really just logically looking to get worse
the way
locations which we can store information
they have address straight to side with addresses are street
our streets for all it addresses for memory
so i think i talked about ah polly i didn't mention the humble from ethiopia last time
op
interestingly
in lots of bob would happily ethiopia there are no street addresses
for anything
anyway
eight million people
not one street address
oh by the way nobody knows the names of every street either
the fight your way by knowing where the nearest well i'm online markets
then turn left and gold listen and take the second rate and stuff like that
really interesting an entire city to fall for products
it really intimidating when you go there you don't know
the way you're after we need to go
anyway so here we have a shoe variable declarations will tie integer one of the game is players war was no obstacles defeated
so long
but somewhat expressive we won our games to be expressive than it allocates space in memory most of no value say it is not a value of zero
if we don't said it's zero we get whatever happens two of them laugh in that memory cells
earlier
we'll know what some random number
if
follow where the rules is rules of everything its ethos was mother's rules lion king means we use for things
ah thirty one character's law
we still have variables are thirty one or two small
the hair or
that's true long to digest and she wanted to fight you gonna make a mistake
taking that
case sensitive
the little thing they are
the exclamation point in the war means not equal to
so both two things are not me

system either fires care what other sport is not something i have to memorize basically take away is usually we won't start power of games with an honor school
it is is convention hall that's for the operating system kind of variables not necessarily are so badly you'll get to that
in this course which is just not usually one hundred stores and for a period may
reserve words
banning any language were coming up with these variables
creating new works great remaining these variables with new name is
there are some names that are reserved that you can't take
so just why am i getting any gmail address or a user name of any service now you can just use the active just want to they'll at gmail dot com so much of that
you know
five minutes after gmail we came back
great that's reserved
ah so you end up with
adding all the extra characters and properties in your case and one two three four and all that kind of stuff to finding something that's not reserve be of some reserves keywords
here
they're five reserve key words in this call anybody wanna take a guess
all the reserve team yes
may
it is
bowling
turner
one more
you as a
i say
interesting i think everything was correct it was said except for me
maine is not reserved key word in c plus plus is a little misleading because i just said there must be a main
and there must only be one but is still lot of reserve key word here is a nice les paul reserve key words for c plus plus
you don't have to memorize this
ah everything in reading
you will know
through this course the word riding cover everything you read hear your use for programming of the scores
just beware you getting your variables any of these
to cause a problem cause a compiler
really critical
all
variables have a tie
we deal with c plus plus
you will find this will change
actually it's a pipe
who's the boss was every variable has its height
the reason is one of the things i'm a question earlier of what he is
i hear what that word is now wage
wait what is wage
it refers to a location memory
we simply given location memory we need to know how much memory we need to give it
and that depends on its height so we need to be explicit about the worst thing is this isn't because the laws of physics this is because it's very efficient to do all this ahead of time to manage a limited resource so like everything in life

the key
quit it cool
passage of computer science is dealing with limited resource
even all we have a max of resources now
that gigabytes of memory and all that all resources are limited
and we're in a deal with that by being explicit are types so we can make sure we use a little memory is possible so we sources off
this is a teenager a tie
soul
these are the basic data had to earn a really use the zoloft this isn't the be all and all of a titan in fact before we leave this course you will create your own data types
in classes if yes

ah good question i get to that why top model
the question was the c plus plus useful of short answer yes
oh what often will you something called love all talk about that man
okay so it goes on let's talk about the saloon that will
cool eons how
two values that that true or false these are reserved the words by the way
and they mainly just what they say
true
or falls to be that's it
can anyone tell me where my eight how will we did it right
the u is
yes
conditional
absolutely
conditional
who wanna know what will it do something it's either yes or no
sure falls so in a conditional it to evaluate to get that thing is true and then you do the condition you do that like if one person remains in a row
then we do so
before pursuing zero messy the truffles
bullying is a very concise way to represent
yes
ah only in a commons for all my
like many things map that
they
that's where it would lead paint
in this sense of seagulls
if only i
if you ever done yet
if
but then

wow
yes yes and hear the answer that question when when when we declare this we saw before this into wage equals twenty
this declaration hesitated type i'm name and then an optional initial ice age
so we always put a bit tight name
an awful it's been hot initial ice age so for dealing with polls use a pool
has been paid yet
equals
also
that's how you would do that
ah what is it evolve value there is no the fall out
that would evolve value is it true false were zero three majors or something like that it's evil values whatever happens to be the garbage laugh
in your memory location that has been reserved for that area
that's why it's a good idea to set it to something when you declare it
that's when i'm back
if
as


i requested you need to reset the sea out to we just bring 'em on one big actually string of all in one
what the what hates keep an eye on as we can have the line it is longer than eight characters that is our style convention art style guide
so we can break it up and multiple ways
we can just instead of having the
semi colon be an overstatement we could put the insert a guide search an operator
kerry to the next line you were the sea out
right
hollywood do it
cause it's a plus plus
to the compiler whites they see is meaningless
passport office
so we can interpret this
and understand what it says

yes
thigh
what a
ah
good eye
in recent fire is why we say the best way to find the air isn't something
put it in for low hundreds of people
we'll find any discrepancy so the question is whether this curly braces
is it really worries here
or look previously the curly braces on the next line like this is meaningless c plus plus some level where we put that
there is a convention and we're going to adhere to in this class though you have two choices
this style
and this guy
those are in the style guy
which is
other resources that of course website
make sure you know your style guy
if you really great that
yes
oh
but it worry it but

ah
excellent observation
there's own old boy here
right
one that's one of which isn't there it's implicit
so with a s
is implicitly boy
huh
i would advocate to be as explicit as possible
usually
i'm in hand over here
yeah if that
the extraction operators so this is an insertion operator
extraction operator is used for c n
will get to that in a minute
op
love
eight
poll numbers
they not for actual components
although i am be careful with that term of fraction because one is a fraction
faith
that's a whole lot
what
not feel the the whole numbers on the number of law
ah five eighty one
there were not leading zero two inevitably zero
for a hundred years that's because you probably won't get into the technical details but it's going to work
not the way you want to
and also get rid of the
com's
the numbers are just numbers the commons is for our readability that will work is a bit
the
if
fathers range is a limit
the limits have real thing
right and two with a major there's a limit as well by default managers are signing
which means is a sign a positive way
therefore we only have thirty two bits to the thirty two is the range of numbers so we can represent four point two billion
everything's
the manager
when it signed it goes negative two billion
to bow positive two billion
i could never tell you besides telling you it's to the thirty one you know they do
two thirty one
positive to the third one and zero know
i would never know let off the exact
you'll have to remember either just roberts la plus minus two billion
which clearly he go over that to about no eight million four trillion it's overflow what happens is is that when you do that
you take this number is a manager to come and buy one
you get this number
turns that it wraps around

that's
most likely behavior or maybe conditions was operating systems would have happened that's gonna happen on her buddies machine here
the one where you can hold for for wall
a number
and to billions not that big of an oath
realistic in computing
double
double is a double precision floating point we can use flow what has a little bit tight and c plus plus what we typically used out
to start with raid were used doubles in this course
if you start getting into efficiency things that you go into advanced classes eucharist are times smaller data types
double precision floating point no words can represent real numbers you can't represent all real numbers
right it's an approximation
real numbers to the best of its ability
all talk more about that in future
if
this historic you want a number
ah plus or minus two two negative ten with three hundred
eight
a and one point seven nine times
ten to three hundred a power that's a pretty big know what that number it's changed
it's it's less culture
probably not an overflow that
crop of characters was revisit we talk about
characters per liter
ah
why it's a question why would suck air yes it's a character is a single character chalk so the chart eight site represents a single character usually you think of this is a popular character here in this context or five
is the characterization representational far
great
yes
yes it does question is does it have to have that cause it has to have equal to the house that the single quotes because if we see ah i am with how close calls we interpret it as the integer quantity ah
if we see five in the single quotes that's the single character of thought
there are special characters that are associated
q you know we don't usually white house like the slash and ah which means new line
it's still represented as a character because the characters is simple flying to at two hundred and fifty six different characters
there's not two hundred and fifty six letters in english language and symbols of you is pretty properties or case
punctuation all as we know other characters like the facts
most say
one better
they have a chart that has
to care so can be a taser char though
just a
give it a a better be straight

straight talk again
hello world
ten of spades
and
ah there's an awesome
program
for every exercise in the east to the corps
of you who wears a plain yogurt
a card game of you
we're doesn't know what the heck i'm talking about with you
isn't that amazing card game while you are in michigan ice strongly encourage you all to try find someone who plays you here have been teaching
he is so much fun is my favorite gay
we love it here it's a michigan they i mean it's people's some other places
but it's an issue getting lots of phone card
experience is why you're here
notice the double quote marks
string
okay
yeah let's take it to that state couple minutes for a quick
they just ownership years into another top

thigh



if



if
and

and
time is short
with papa little bit about operators
if
ah for years he was the ability
to do something with their buried in one of the transformation wanna be on the head two numbers together to get an answer
operators ah he's a simple mathematical operators there's a lot more operators in this weird it's all with the extraction and
the insertion into action operators
ah
straight forward here this is another example now hundred and one through this real quick
notice the
what happens in executions level of where there's an execution
passing away what do we want this program on a machine it's abstract you
or execution starts what's the calming the first day and executes we have no flowers gone
variable years it's location in memory we decided initial value of twenty
we have that status on the board the next day
i know what the next day the next it's all falls through
after we actually one of the other we print number of highly florist you want
we declare a manager notice that this declaration doesn't associate of values for relocation that value is zero
it's not wholly it's whatever was in that piece of memory for some random number
ah i see in state
so is pronounced c n
as a way we can get input from the people
right now in our program we get half the user something we have to use c out different what's called the crops they took a prompt the user to enter something allies is
her through the
or less what to do with this
printer prophecy out a new c n
now
i type fifteen of breast cancer
on the line here
a little enter
it's a little bit career
that isn't me typing
brackets t n t e r rack
that is the designation for me to press the enter key after our first one five
this notation will be used on examples
so that's what it means so here i type one five n press the enter key
then it as usual select statement
see ya prints that
then when it hit the next statement
the
take this number is effective for the summer and then
see our friends it as
execution will slice get it just to move on to the max example but the execution more than that
get a return lying
and the function will pay off that's not so long was like but it does have
i'm sure
the rate we would expect this addition subtraction multiplication
and ah
modular us modules is something that he is pervasive
cute we use it all last one different than what you why it's ah i mean i don't think in math classes when
module
all that often we sure you use a lot of
and you'll use it
a lot says well you use it on your first
program which by the way is to be released pretty soon the first for rent sign
shall be unleashed i used to
you know how about two weeks to complete it
if
fat
getting one time so i think i'm used to talk about this little
some economy use the i need to show you
i know what
but anyhow
it's only to see
see you next may have a great way to get
