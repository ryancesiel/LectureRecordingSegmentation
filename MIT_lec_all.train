PROFESSOR: So what I want to do today is I want to talk about what the heck this course is. What is microeconomics? What are you going to be learning in this course? And just, sort of, set us up for the semester. OK. So basically, microeconomics is all about scarcity. It's all about how individuals and firms make decisions given that we live in a world of scarcity. Scarcity is key because basically what we're going to learn about this semester in various shapes and forms is a lot of different types of constrained optimization. We're going to learn a lot about different ways that individuals make choices in a world of scarcity. OK?


That is, this course is going to be about trade-offs. Given scarce resources, how the individuals and firms trade off different alternatives to make themselves as well-off as possible. That's why economics is called the dismal science. OK? It's called the dismal science because we are not about everyone have everything. We're always the people who say, no, you can't have everything. You have to make a trade- off. OK? You have to give up x to get y. And that's why people don't like us. OK? Because that's why we're called the dismal science, because we're always pointing out the trade-offs that people face.


Now, some may call it dismal, but I call it fun. And that may be because of my MIT training, as I said I was an undergraduate here. In fact, MIT is the perfect place to teach microeconomics because this whole institute is about engineering solutions which are really ultimately about constrained optimization. Indeed, what's the best example in the world we have of this? It's the 270 contest. Right? You're given a pile of junk, you've got to build something that does something else. That's an exercise in constrained optimization.


All engineering is really constrained optimization. How do you take the resources you're given and do the best job building something. And that's really what microeconomics is. Just like 270 is not a dismal contest, microeconomics is not to me a dismal science. You could think of this course like 270. But instead of the building robots, we're running people's lives. OK? That's, kind of, the way I like to think about this course. Instead of trying to decide how we can build something to move a ping pong ball across a table, we're trying to decide how people make their decisions to consume, and firms make their decisions to produce. That's basically what's going to go on in this class.


OK? And that's why basically modern microeconomics was founded at MIT in the 1950s by Paul Samuelson. The father of modern economics was a professor here, and he basically founded the field. He basically introduced mathematics to economics. And through teaching this course, 14.01, 50, 60 years ago, actually developed the field that we now study.


Now, what we're going to do in this class, is focused on two types of actors in the economy: consumers and producers. OK? And we are going to build models of how consumers and producers behave. Now, technically, a model is going to be a description of any relationship between two or more economic variables. OK? That's a model. A description of any relationship between two or more economic variables.


The trick with economics, and the reason many of you will be frustrated during the semester, is that unlike the modern relationship between say energy and mass these models are never precise. They are never accurate to the 10th decimal. OK? This is not a precise, scientific relationship with modeling. We'll be making a number of simplifying assumptions that allow us to capture the main tendencies in the data. That allow us to capture the main insights into how individuals make consumption decisions and how firms make production decisions. But it's not going to be as clean and precise as the kind of proofs you're going to be doing in some of your other classes in freshman and sophomore year. OK?


So basically, we have a trade off with the simplifying assumptions. On the one hand, obviously we want a model that can explain reality as much as possible. If a model can't explain reality, it's not useful. On the other hand, we need a model that's tractable, a model that I can teach you in a lecture or less. OK? And basically, what we do is we make a lot of simplifying assumptions in this class to make those models work. And yet, what we'll find is despite these assumptions, we'll come up with incredibly powerful predictions of how consumers and producers behave.


So with consumers what we're going to do is, we're going to say that consumers are constrained by their limited wealth or what we'll call their budget constraint. And subject to that constraint they choose the set of goods that makes them as well off as possible. OK? That's what we're going to call utility maximization. We'll say the consumers maximize their utility, consumers are going to maximize utility subject to a budget constraint. That's going to be what we're going to develop the consumer decision.
They have some utility function which is going to be a model of their preferences. OK?
So I'm going to propose to take everything you love in life and write it down as a u function. OK? Then I'm going to propose you take all the resources at your disposal, write them down as a budget constraint and then I just do constrained maximization to solve for how you make decisions. Firms, on the other hand, are going to maximize profits. Pi is profits. Firms are going to maximize profits. Their goal is to make as much profit as possible, to earn as much money as possible. OK? However, that's going to be subject to both the demands of consumers, we get to firms it's a lot harder, subject to both consumer demand and input costs.


So firms have to consider, consumers have to consider look what does stuff cost and what do I like, I'll make my decision. Firms is a little more complicated. They've go to consider, what do consumers want and how do I make what they want? So they've got to consider both the output side, what a consumer is going to want me to make and what's it going to cost me to produce that good? And how do I combine those to make the most profits? OK?


So from these assumptions, we will be able to answer the three fundamental questions of microeconomics. OK? The three fundamental questions of microeconomics will be, what goods and services should be produced? What goods and services should be produced? How to produce those goods and services? And who gets the goods and services? What goods and services get produced? How to produce those goods and services? And who gets them? And what's amazing, we'll learn in this course, is that all three of these questions, the three fundamental questions that drive our entire economy, are all solved through the role of one key state variable, which is prices.


Prices in the economy resolve all of these problems. OK? Consumers and firms will interact in a market, they'll interact in a marketplace. And out of that marketplace will emerge a set of prices, in a way we'll describe. And those prices will allow firms and consumers to make the relevant decisions. OK?

[[The Role of Prices: Examples]
So let me just give you one, and we're going to do all this rigorously throughout the semester, let me just start with one casual example. OK? Let's think about the development of the iPod. OK? Let's cast our minds way back, lo way back to the development of the iPod. OK? Now, when Apple was thinking about making the iPod, they had to ask, would consumers want this? So consumers had to decide given their limited resources, given the fact that they were buying a certain set of things would they be willing to forsake some things they were already doing to spend the money on the iPod? OK?


It was a non-trivial amount of money. Would they be willing to forsake things they are already doing? OK? To spend money on the iPod. And clearly they were. Clearly, consumers were willing to spend
money, to spend a lot of money, to get an iPod. They were originally what? $300 Back when $300 meant something. OK. So basically, what the firm will do is they'll say, OK, we get a signal from the consumer that they're willing to pay money to get the iPod. They're willing to pay a high price to get the iPod.


Now, the firm will say, well, should we make iPods? Well, that will depend on what it cost to make them. So we have to then assess what are the inputs that we'll need to make an iPod? Well, to do that we have to look at the prices of the various inputs that we'll need, of the chip in them and the metal and all the other stuff that goes into the iPod. OK? So they can shop across different countries, to different kinds of chips, they can look at different kinds of monitors, et cetera.


But, once again, what they'll do is they'll use the prices of those different inputs to decide how to produce the iPod. So whether to produce the iPod will depend on the price people are willing to pay for it. How to make the iPod will depend on the prices that firms have to pay for the chip and the casing and all the other things that go into the iPod. OK? And then finally, who's going to get the iPod? Well, they're going to make a certain amount. What decided who gets them? Well, the person who gets them are the people who are willing to pay the price that Apple decides to charge. Some people are willing to pay that price, they're going to get an iPod. Some people are not willing to pay that price, they will not get an iPod. So the price in the market will ultimately decide who gets the iPod, as well. OK?


So basically, prices will determine what gets produced, how it's produced, and who gets the goods that are produced. OK? Of course, this is a very, very simplified example, as you can already tell. There are lots of cases where prices don't decide these things. So my favorite example is the fact that there are lines for hours to get tickets to see a Lady Gaga concert. OK? Now if it's really true that prices determine everything, we shouldn't see any lines. It should just be that those who are willing to pay the most to see Lady Gaga should. Those who want the most to get Lady Gaga should get the tickets. Those who aren't willing to pay shouldn't get the tickets. Why should there be a line? Not to mention the fact that people shouldn't be willing to pay anything, but that's a different issue. That's a taste issue. We'll come to taste later. OK?


So basically, clearly this is not working perfectly. If the world worked in the way I just described, then what should happen is there should be essentially an auction and whoever is willing to pay the most for Lady Gaga tickets would get them. And whoever is not willing to pay wouldn't. It wouldn't involve any waiting in line or other things. Now, what's very interesting is we've actually seen an evolution from my youth to your youth towards the economic model.
When I was a kid, if you wanted, so then it was Cars tickets, OK, to date myself, OK, you had to go and camp out at 3:00 in the morning outside the store where they're selling them to get the tickets. Now, of course, you don't do that anymore. Now you go on Stub Hub or Ticketmaster or these other secondary sellers and there there are prices that determine it. So how many people have waited on line to get a concert ticket? That's amazing. So if I asked this question 30 years ago, 90% of the hands would have gone up. OK?


So what that means is the price mechanism has started to be used. It has replaced the line mechanism as a way to allocate those tickets. And we see prices working. That wasn't true. There wasn't StubHub. There weren't these secondary ticket sellers 30 years ago. You had to wait on line to get the tickets.

[[Important Distinctions in Economics]
Now, so that's basically, sort of, an overview about, sort of an example, of how we think about the role of prices. Now, let me draw a couple of important distinctions, terms I'm going to use this semester that I want you to be comfortable with. OK? The first distinction I want to draw is between theoretical versus empirical economics. Theoretical versus empirical economics. OK. Theoretical economics is the process of building models to explain the world. OK? Empirical economics is the process of testing those models to see how good a job they do in explaining the world. OK?


We could all make up a model. OK? Anybody with math skills could make up a model. But it doesn't do any good unless it's actually doing something to explain the world. And so basically, the goal of theoretical economics is essentially to build a model that has some testable predictions. To build a model that says, look here's my simplified model of how consumers decide whether or not to buy an iPod. OK? I have a model of that, that I've built theoretically. Well, that has some testable predictions. And the role of empirical economics is to gather the data and go and test them using statistical methods. Specifically, typically regression analysis like the kind you learn about in advanced statistics. OK?


So basically, what we're going to do is we're going to is 95% of this course will be about theoretical economics this semester. It will be about understanding how economists develop the models to model how consumers and firms behave. But I will try to talk somewhat about empirical economics and what data we can bring to bear to understand whether or not these models explain the world. OK?


The other distinction that's very important is positive versus normative economics. Positive versus normative economics. And this is the distinction between the way things are, which is positive economics, and the way things should be which is normative economics. Distinction between the way things are and the way things should be. OK? So let's consider a great example of microeconomics at
work which is auctions on eBay. OK? Auctions on eBay, economists love studying auctions on eBay because it's a textbook example of what we call a perfectly competitive market which is what we'll focus on the semester. A perfectly competitive market. OK?


And by that we mean that basically that producers in this market offer up their good to a wide range of consumers. OK? A number of producers offer up their goods to a wide range of consumers. OK? And the consumers bid up the price until the person who has the highest value for the good gets it. So price serves exactly the signal it should in allocating goods. OK? So really eBay's really sort of about this third thing of who gets the good. OK?

[[Positive vs. Normative Analysis of the eBay Kidney Auction]
I offer my alarm clock or whatever on eBay, OK, and then people bid on that. And whoever values that the most, that rare Jon Gruber alarm clock the most, they get it. OK? So it's a perfect textbook example. OK? And basically, because on eBay the price is used, or now with also StubHub and concert tickets, the price is used to allocate the good to the person who wants it the most. OK? Now, a recent example of an auction on eBay that a lot of attention, not so recent anymore a couple years ago, someone tried to auction their kidney on eBay. OK?


Someone offered their kidney for auction on eBay and said, I have two kidneys I only need one. So I'm going to auction my kidney, you pay for me to fly to wherever you need my kidney and the operation, they take it out and they give it to you. And that's the way it goes. So what happened was person offered their kidney and they said the starting price will be $25,000. They didn't do a buy it now. They said the starting price will be $25,000 and the bidding went on. The price got to $5 million before eBay shot it down. eBay shut the auction down. And eBay said no, in fact, you can't do this.


Now there's two questions here. The first is, why did the price of the kidney go so high? That's the positive question. The positive question is, why did the price the kidney on eBay get so high? And here, we'll talk, and you'll learn more starting Friday, about the twin forces of supply and demand. The twin forces that drive the economy of supply and demand. And you'll talk more rigorously about these on Friday. Basically, they're what they sound like. Demand is how much someone wants something. Supply is how much of it there is to have.


And the intuition here is surprising. OK? The more that there's demand for a good, the higher will be the upward pressure on prices. The more people want a good, the higher prices will go. And the less supply there is of a good, also the higher prices will go. So if everybody wants something but it's common, the price will be low. And if no one wants something but it's uncommon, the price will still be low, and vice
versa. In fact, the development of the model of supply and demand framework was from Adam Smith, the, sort of, so-called first economist who wrote The Wealth of Nations in 1776 which is, sort of, viewed as the, kind of, first serious book about economics.


And he posed what he called the water diamond paradox. What Smith said in that book is, look, it's clear water is the most important thing in life. We can't live without water. And diamonds are completely irrelevant to life. You can live totally fine without a diamond. And yet, the price of diamonds is astronomical and water's free. How can this be? How can it be that water which is so much more of a fundamental building block of our life is so much cheaper than diamonds which are not. And the answer, of course, is that so far you've only considered demand and not supply.


Yes, it's true. The demand for water is much higher than the demand for diamonds. But the supply is even larger. So that basically, yes it's true that while water should be worth more, in fact, in the end the price of water is much lower, because of the twin forces of demand and supply. The demand is higher, but the supply is much higher. So the price ends up lower. And that was his diamond water paradox.
OK?



Well, in this case, it's a similar thing. What determines the demand for a kidney? What determines the demand for a kidney is going to be the fact that you die without it. OK? If you have no kidneys, you're having kidney failure. OK? You'll die without it. So basically, what will determine it is people are willing to spend all their wealth, as much money as they can have, to get a kidney OK? So the demand will be quite high. The supply will be quite low.


Sadly, not many people are willing to be organ donors. More relevantly, a lot of people aren't in good situations to be organ donors. OK? As a result, the supply is much lower than the demand. So we have a situation with a high demand, a low supply and the price went through the roof. That's a positive analysis. OK? So we can understand pretty intuitively. We don't need this course to understand why the price went up. OK? It's just the twin powers of demand and supply.


But what about the normative question which is, should eBay have allowed this sale to happen? EBay at
$5 million cut it off and then passed the rule saying you can't auction your body parts on eBay. OK? Should they have done that? That's the normative question. That's economics gets really interesting, which is you all are smart enough to figure out why the price went up. But this is where it gets interesting is should people have been able to auction their kidney on eBay?


On the one hand, many, many people in this country die for want of a body part. OK? Thousands to hundreds of thousands of people die every year waiting for a transplant. OK? If someone is incredibly rich and they want a body part, which to me a surplus because I have two kidneys, why shouldn't they be allowed to buy it from me? I'm better off because they can pay me a ton of money. They are better off because they live. So I've just described a transaction that makes both parties better off. Why shouldn't that be allowed to happen? So you tell me. Does everyone think eBay was wrong? Yeah, go ahead.


AUDIENCE: Say there is another person who doesn't have as much money, and that person also dies.



PROFESSOR: You mean the person who, what do you mean the person doesn't have as much-



AUDIENCE: --so obviously somebody doesn't get the kidney.



PROFESSOR: So in other words, what you're assuming is, let's say that if I hadn't done the auction on eBay, I would have just given my kidney away to the transplant center. Then that's one less kidney that can go to the transplant center. And that means the rich guy gets the kidney, and someone else implicitly doesn't. That's a trade-off. You've just described a trade-off. The trade-off is that basically now we've allocated the kidney away from the poor person to the rich person. Now, but why do we care about that? I mean one person dies, another person lives, why do we care? Yeah?


AUDIENCE: There would be some sort of case of severity in condition. Like there might be someone who's poor who would get the kidney if it went to a transplant association because they would die in a couple of days without it. Whereas the rich person might just be able to afford it, and it might make their life more convenient. But they might not be in any more peril.


PROFESSOR: They might be a collector. So basically, that's right. So one reason we might care is because we think that kidneys should be allocated on the basis of who needs it the most. OK? So a great example of this, of course, was Mickey Mantle with a liver transplant. Mickey Mantle, famous ballplayer, raging alcoholic, who had liver failure because he was basically drinking himself to death, and jumped the queue and got a liver above a bunch, a lot of people and then he kept drinking and killed himself and wasted the liver he'd gotten. OK?


So basically, you can think that doesn't make sense. We should give it to people who need it the most. For who it would do the most good in terms of increasing their life. OK. So we've got the substitution point. OK. Let's come back to the substitution point though. Tell me a situation in which that's wrong. Can someone tell me a situation in which, in fact, that not a valid point. Yeah.


AUDIENCE: Well, if the guy is only going to sell it. He's not going to give it away.



PROFESSOR: Exactly. You're assuming that the guy who did sell would give it away. But, in fact, if it's sell it or keep it then there's no trade-off. And similar here, if it's sell it or keep it then you might as well let the rich guy get it. Or is there another argument? Is there another reason why you might not want this to happen? Yeah.


AUDIENCE: It would encourage people to use illegal ways of getting kidneys.



PROFESSOR: So the other reason could be that we don't trust people to make good decisions when money's involved. That we think that, gee, if it's really true I can get a couple million bucks for a kidney, I might give mine up even if I haven't really thought through the ramifications of doing so. Even if there's a risk to the surgery, if there's a risk that my other kidney will then fail then I'll be screwed. OK? So basically, we might have a paternalistic attitude that will lead us to not want to allow people to engage in this kind of risky behavior. Yeah?


AUDIENCE: There may also be some legal ramifications associated with that if someone sells their kidney and then their other kidney fails, they might then blame eBay.


PROFESSOR: Want it back. Like that Repo movie.



That's right. There could, but let's leave the lawyers out of this, OK? I don't like lawyers. I'm going to rag on lawyers this semester. We're going leave the lawyers out of this. But, in any case, you're right. That's, sort of, a ramification of the same thing. So we've talked about the fact that there's substitution. We've talked about the fact that it's not allocated to those who need it the most. We've talked about the fact that people might be making bad decisions in doing this.


But there's another factor, as well, which is we may just as a society feel it's unfair that rich people can get things poor people can't. There may be a pure equity component here. OK? Which is simply that we as a society value equality, value income inequality. And we think people should not have an extra shot at getting a resource just because they're rich. Now that is a very deep and hard concept, and we'll spend a couple lectures talking about equity towards the end of the semester. By and large, we won't consider it. OK?


But it turns out to be behind much of what we'll discuss, OK, in much of what we'll discuss this semester and much of what goes on in economics. OK? Just take a look at the debate that's going on right now in terms of President Obama trying to decide whether or not to extend tax cuts to wealthy individuals in the US. Some people argue that allowing those tax cuts would promote the economy. OK? But others argue it's unfair for rich people to get tax breaks. And that fairness argument matters a lot in terms of driving the kind of economic policy decisions we need to make.

[[Everyday Applications of Economics]
So this semester, we're going to focus a lot on efficiency and optimization and how to get resources to the right place. But you have to remember behind a lot of this is deep normative issues about what should be happening, how should an economy function, and, in particular, how should we think about these kind of equity issues that are so important. OK. The last thing I want to talk about is I want to talk about why micro is not just an abstract concept for things like you might say, oh this is all pretty funny and it's like selling kidneys on eBay and tax cuts for the rich and why do I care? OK?


Well, you care because literally every decision you make is made through the kind of framework we're going to think about this semester. OK? Now, different decisions may follow our models more closely and less closely. But there is not an economic decision. OK? Sorry, let me back up. There's not a decision that people have made that economists haven't tried to model. From whether to produce iPods, to how many times to have sex each week. OK? These are all things economists have tried to model with varying degrees of success. OK?


Because economists think that these all come from the same decision theoretic framework that we can discuss. Let's talk about a simple example from this course. Your decision of whether or not to buy the textbook. There's a textbook and what's it cost? $140? What's it cost? Does anyone know?


AUDIENCE: This line says $180. And this one says $180, but it's available for $130.


PROFESSOR: $130, fine. So $130 for Professor Perloff out at Berkeley. He doesn't get it all. I wrote a textbook too. He gets a small share of it. OK. So you have to decide, now has anyone bought a used version of the fourth, well it's the fifth edition now, does anybody use a version of the fourth edition? Does anyone know what the used price is? You can be honest. I don't care.


AUDIENCE: I know some people found it for like $85 or so.



PROFESSOR: So $85. So you've got to decide. So let's say you can buy the previous edition, the fourth edition, for $85 or the current edition for $130. OK? You've got to make that decision. OK? How do you make that decision. Well you may think, gee I just make the decision. It's not really about microeconomics. But it is. We're going to model how you think about a decision like that.


Well how do you think about a decision like that? Well, the first thing you consider is your preferences. How much are you willing to take a chance that there's new stuff in the fifth edition that you need to know? OK? If the fifth issue was identical to the fourth edition then you'd be an idiot to not just buy the used fourth edition. But it's not. Textbook writers are smart. They update their book. OK?


So basically, the fifth edition is updated. There's new things in it. So you have to ask yourself, what are the odds that I need some of the new information in the fifth edition and not in the fourth edition? And in thinking about that, you're going to think about your preferences. In particular, are you very risk averse, are you afraid to take a chance? Or are you risk loving? Are you willing to take a chance? OK?
That's one side of the equation.



If you're someone that says, you know I will not take a chance in life. I just have to make sure I learn the most possible from this course. Then you're going to want that new edition. If you're someone that says, you know what screw it, I'll just figure it out later. I'm going to the lectures. I don't care. OK? Then you might not want it that much. So that's the first factor, is going to be your preferences and break down how much you are willing to take a risk that you need this fifth edition.


The second factor is going to be your constraint: how much money you have. OK. The more money you have, the more you're willing, or more relevant perhaps your parents have, the more willing you are to go ahead and buy that new edition. The less money you have, the less willing you are. OK? So basically,
it's going to depend on whether you're paying or your parents are paying, in which case what the hell you might as well buy the fifth edition. OK?


And then finally, you're going to take these preferences and this constraint, your preferences and your resources, and go to the market and look at what does the market tell me the difference is. So you're going to say, here's how much I kind of care about fifth versus fourth edition, here's the resources I have, now I'll go to the market and say, aha there is a $45 difference between these two editions. So now I will solve that constrained optimization problem. And I'll decide whether I want to get that book.


You are going to be thinking to yourself, this is stupid. I never think about it that way. But the key point is you don't have to think about it exactly that way. There's a famous example in economics of what's called the as if principle. I don't know if kids still say this one, as if. So it's the as if principle. OK? And basically it's from Milton Friedman, the famous economist from Chicago, who said, look, when you're playing pool, technically you could compute the optimal angles of which to shoot the ball every single time to get the appropriate bounce and get the balls in. You could do the mathematics and compute it.


But professional pool players are not in this class with you, I'll only say that. OK? They're not guys who are able to do that computation. They just know how to hit the ball to get the same outcome they would get if they mathematically solved for the optimal trajectory to hit the ball. OK? They behave as if they've solved the constrained optimization problem. And your decision when you buy this book, you may not think it through the very framework that I just laid out very heuristically and will lay out more rigorously this semester. But you're going to behave as if you do. Because those facts are going to be in your mind, and you'll be thinking about it when you make that decision.


So while you may feel the models we learn in this course are rather abstract and don't really explain how you behave in an everyday basis, you're going to behave as if those models are really applying to you. And if you think about, over the next few days, think about the decisions you make. From should I bring an umbrella today, it looks like rain? Well, on the one hand, I might lose it. It's a pain to carry. On the other hand, how much do I care about getting wet? That's a constrained optimization decision.


To should I have an extra drink at a party Friday night? On the one hand, that could have some pros and cons. OK? These are all decisions, constrained optimization decisions, you're going to make. They're going to affect your life. And what we'll learn this semester is about how you make them and how we model, how economists can use what we learn about that to understand the function of the economy. OK?


So I'm going to stop there. One other announcement, there will, in general, be handouts every lecture. I'm not going to do PowerPoint. I'm going to do handouts. So when you come in every lecture, please look at the back banister. Though typically, not today. But typically, they'll be handouts that you'll need to follow along with in class. So remember, go to section on Friday, first problems that will be posted on Friday and it will be due in section the Friday after. And I'll see you all back here on Monday, next Monday.

PROFESSOR: Now, what we're going to do today is build on what you learned in section on Friday. On Friday, you learned about how supply and demand interact to yield equilibrium. So the sort of fundamental concepts we talked about with Adam Smith and his water-diamond paradox of supply and demand interacting to yield a market price and quantity.


And the way we're going to build on your understanding of this today is talk about what happens when you shock that supply and demand equilibrium. When things change, how does that change that supply and demand equilibrium? And that'll help build your understanding of what you learned.


So to review, let's go to our basic supply and demand graph, Figure 2-1 in the handout. You talked in section about the market for pork. That's the market Perloff uses. Seems good as any, so we'll continue to rely on that, the market for pork. And in this pork market, you have a demand curve and a supply curve.


Now, it's critical to remember what these curves represent. Once again, for this course, ideally, you understand all concepts on three levels, intuitively, graphically, and mathematically. But the intuitive is the most important, especially for those of you who aren't going to go on and do a whole lot of economics. For instance, where it's just one of the few economics courses you'll take, it's very important for your lives and using economics you understand this intuitively.


So intuitively, let's talk about what the demand curve represents. Can anyone tell me, what's the demand curve represent, from what you learned on Friday? Can anyone just take a shot? We're just-- yeah, go ahead.


AUDIENCE: The willingness of consumers to buy a certain product.


PROFESSOR: Exactly. The willingness of consumers-- I'm going to change your words just a bit, because words are important here. The willingness of consumers to pay. The willingness to pay. The difference with buy is it's really because the different amounts. They're going to be willing to pay different amounts.


So it's the willingness of consumers to pay for the good. The willingness of consumers to pay for the good. So what this says is that each point in the demand curve represents the price consumers are willing to pay for that quantity. And it's downward sloping. The demand curve is downward sloping because as the price goes up, consumers are willing to buy less of a good. So their willingness to pay changes.


So that's the demand curve. Now what about supply curve? What's a supply curve represent? Anyone? Yeah?


AUDIENCE: Pretty much the opposite. The willingness of producers to produce, like, how much they are going to charge for--


PROFESSOR: Yeah, the willingness of producers to supply the good. So how much they're going to charge for a given quantity of the good. And once again, that is upward sloping because as the price rises, they're willing to supply more. So as the price rises, consumers demand less. As the price rises, producers produce more.


And equilibrium is that point where supply equals demand. Equilibrium equals happiness. It's the point where suppliers and demanders are both happy. They're both happy because at a point such as e, the amount that consumers demand at that price is equal to the amount suppliers are willing to supply at that price.


So jointly happy. You've reached a point where consumers want a certain amount at a certain price. At that price, producers say, great, you want e, I'm happy to produce e at that price. So we've reached equilibrium.

[[Impact of a Demand Shift]
Now, let's talk about what happens when we shock that equilibrium. This is the market for pork. Imagine that the price of beef rises. The price of beef rises. Can anyone give me a guess as to what that does to the market for pork? The price of beef rises. What does that do to the market for pork. Yeah.


AUDIENCE: It reduces the demand.



PROFESSOR: It what?



AUDIENCE: Reduces the demand.



PROFESSOR: Why would it reduce the demand for pork?



AUDIENCE: Because the price [INAUDIBLE].



PROFESSOR: But I didn't say the price of pork rises. The price of beef rises. And how does beef relate to pork?


AUDIENCE: They're substitutes.



PROFESSOR: They're substitutes. Exactly. So when the price of beef prices, how does that affect people's demand for pork? Increases it. Exactly. Because they're substitutes. What we're going to learn critically as we go through is what's going to determine these demand curves importantly is going to be substitutability across goods.


So here we have a situation where the substitute for pork has gotten more expensive. As a result, people want more pork. That is a shift out in the demand curve, or a shift up in the demand curve. A shift up or out, depending on it's out into space or up vertically in the demand curve.
So what happens here is that folks shift to consuming pork, so they want more of it. So we're initial equilibrium-- we just made up some numbers-- we're initial equilibrium here at 220 millions of kilograms of pork a year and a price of $3 a kilogram. That was the initial equilibrium. That was the point where demanders and suppliers were happy.


Now the price of beef has gone up, maybe because-- I don't know. Mad cow disease or something like that has raised the price of beef. So now people are saying, hey, we want more pork. That shifts the demand curve out. Initially, if the price stayed at $3, if the price remained at $3, what would happen? What would happen is people would now-- and once again, these numbers are made up. But this is just to illustrate an example.


People would now say, gee, at a price of $3 and this further out demand curve-- now I'm on Figure 2-2, if you haven't picked that up-- I want 232 millions of kilograms of pork a year-- not I, personally. That'd be like Homer. Everybody wants 232 millions of kilograms of pork a year. I hope you guys don't get tired of Simpsons references.


So what that says is consumers say, gee, I want a lot more pork at that price. If it's going to be $3, and the price of beef just went up, I'm going to want a lot more pork. So what you're going to have initially is excess demand, because at that price of $3, suppliers are only willing to supply 220 million kilograms.
They were happy, right? They were happy at point e1. When you come along, and you say consumers now want more, they say, well, we're not happy to provide more at that price. If you want more, we're going to have to charge a higher price.


So they say, if you want more pork, we're going to have to produce more. So we are going to slide up the supply curve. So if you start at a point like e1, they say, gee, you want more pork? Well, we're going to have to slide up that supply curve. So we're moving up the supply curve and saying, we're going to have to charge you a higher price if you want more.


Well, as the price goes up, consumers say, well, wait a second. If the price is going up, I don't want quite as much more. And you meet at the new equilibrium e2. So what happens is producers say, gee, if you want more, I'm going to charge you a higher price.
Consumers say, well, gee, if you're charging a higher price, I'm going to go back up the demand curve. I don't quite want as much at that higher price. And the new equilibrium is e2. That's where consumers and producers are now happier with that outward shift in demand curve.


But the key point is consumers are not getting as much as they originally wanted at the original price, because the original price will not hold. The price is going to change. Given the price is going to change, the quantity is going to change. And you end up with both a higher price and a higher quantity for pork.


So think about it. This is pretty interesting. The price of beef rising raised the price of pork. It didn't just increase the demand for pork, but through increasing the demand, it raised the price. So price in one market affects the price in another market, not just the quantity but the price in another market. And that's our new equilibrium. That's the shift in the demand curve.


And once again, suppliers and demanders are happy. They're happy at this new point e2, this new equilibrium, because given the new demand curve, at a price of $3.50 a kilogram, producers are happy to produce the 228 million kilograms of pork a year that consumers want. And at that price, that's what consumers want.


If they're going to say, oh, it's $3.50, I want about 228. I want more than I wanted before, because beef's gotten more expensive, but not as much as I would have wanted if you hadn't increased your price. And that's the new equilibrium is e2. Yeah.


AUDIENCE: But is it possible that changing the price of pork could affect the price of beef?



PROFESSOR: Excellent. So the question is, could there be a feedback effect where, basically, now the pork market's changed, could that go back and affect the beef market? In principle, yes. In practice, we're going to make your life easy by saying no. In principle, it could. And that gets into something called "general equilibrium." And that's way too complicated for this course, so we are going to ignore those kinds of feedback effects for now. That's something you can learn about more in future courses.


But you're right. In principle, it could affect the demand for everything. You could imagine that as the price of beef goes up, that means that, for example, the cost of restaurant meals goes up. So I'm not
going to eat at the restaurant as much, so maybe I'll go to the movies more. So in principle, the price of beef going up could raise the demand for movies.


It's crazy. It's hard to know where to stop. So we're going to make your life easy by stopping at one level here. But you're right. In principle, there could be these wide range of feedbacks.


And once again, I talked in the first lecture about simplifying assumptions. We're going to try to teach you the basic concepts but try to make simplifying assumptions that make it more manageable. That's the kind of simplifying assumption we'll make for our modeling here in this course. So that's a shift in the demand curve. Yeah.


AUDIENCE: How do you quantify the shifts in the demand curve?



PROFESSOR: Excellent. And that will be exactly-- basically, the way we're going to learn in this course, we're going to do things a couple of times. When we talk about producer theory, we will teach you where this supply curve comes from. Basically, firm profit-maximizing decisions will determine the supply curve and how much it shifts, and we'll teach you that when we teach you producer theory.


So this is sort of a big overview. You're good MIT students. You're immediately thinking, where the hell do these demand and supply curves come from? That's where we're going to get to. That's the whole point of consumer theory will give us the demand curve. Producer theory will give us the supply curve. All right. Good questions.

[[Impact of a Supply Shift]
So now, let's talk about a different case. Let's talk about a shift in the supply curve. So now, let's suppose there's a drought. And let's suppose it's a drought that only affects pork. Because if the drought affected beef, that would then have these other feedback effects.


Let's imagine there's a pork drought. I don't know what that would mean, but let's imagine that happened. So suddenly, it becomes more expensive-- or let's just say there's mad pig disease. Let's imagine there's mad pig disease. So suddenly, it becomes more expensive to produce pork. Because there's fewer pigs, it's more expensive to produce it.
So what that would do is that would cause a shift in in the supply curve-- inward or upward of the supply curve. Suddenly, on you get the fact that given that it's more expensive to produce pork, suppliers say, well gee, to produce a given amount of pork, I need to get paid a higher price. So we get, once again, initially, if the price stayed constant-- so now I'm on Figure 2-3. If the price stayed constant, we would not begin with excess demand. Because if the price stayed constant, then consumers would want 220 million kilograms of pork, which is what they wanted before.


Nothing's changed from their perspective. But producers would say, look, at that price, I can only now produce 205, because my supply curve shifted up. So once again, you have to move to a new equilibrium where suppliers and consumers are happy.


That will happen at a point like e2. Because at e2, given the higher price of producing pork, producers will now say, OK, I'm happy to sell 215 million kilograms at $3.55. And consumers will say, well gee, at
$3.55, I don't want quite as much as I wanted before. I only want 215. And they're happy.



Here's what's striking. We had two very different phenomena. We had a demand shift and a supply shift. Both led to the same outcome. I'm sorry, both led to a higher price. Sorry, not the same outcome. Both led to a higher price. One led to higher demand, to higher quantity sold in the market.


So you go back to Figure 2-2. The price went up, and the quantity in the market went up from 220 to
228. In Figure 2-3, when the supply shift happened, the price also went up almost exactly the same amount. But here, the quantity fell.


So you can't tell from a price increase what happened. If the price of pork goes up, you can't tell me whether that was a demand or supply shift. You need to know both the price and quantity to be able to tell me that. Both changes led to the same outcome in terms of prices. Questions about that?

[[Government Interference: The Labor Market]
Now let's make it interesting. So we have the supply and demand equilibrium. Supply shifts, demand shifts, you move the points. You guys can all do it graphically, even if you don't quite get it intuitively yet. Now let's ask, what happens if the government comes in and messes this up?


Now, step aside to my other hat. The other course I teach is called Public Economics, which is all about the role of the government in the economy. In this course, most of what you'll learn is there's a clear
role of the government in the economy. It's to screw it up. Economics is fundamentally a right-wing science. Most of my colleagues are Democrats, but that doesn't change the fact that what we teach is fundamentally very conservative, which is the market knows best, and governments just mess things up.


Now, later in the semester, we'll talk about why that might not be true. And the whole point of my other course, 14.41, is to talk about why that might not be true and where governments can make things worse and better. But from your basic perspective, you need to be indoctrinated with this fundamental position, that the market gets it right. The market equilibrates. Governments mess things up. And that's sort of where we'll start.


So let's talk about the classic example of government messing things up, the minimum wage. You've all heard of the minimum wage, the thing workers get paid more. That seems like a good thing. Well, in fact, to economists, it's a bad thing. And let's talk about why.


To many economists, at least this initial analysis is a bad thing. We'll come back later as to why it might not be so bad. To do that, let's talk about equilibrium not in a market for goods, like pork, but in a market for inputs, which is labor. Labor is an input to the production process. We'll talk about this at great length later in the semester.


But the key thing is, just like there's a market for pork where the equilibrium outcome is the price you pay for pork and the amount of pork sold, there's a market for labor. And in that market, things are flipped. Who are the consumers now? Well, they're the firms. The firms demand labor. Who are suppliers now? Well, they're you. They're the people. People supply labor.


So now we've flipped things on its head. The suppliers are the people. The demanders are the firms. But the analysis is the same. This basic supply and demand framework, which will turn out to be so powerful this semester, can be used, even though we flipped the labels of who's on what side. So you see in Figure 2.4, we have a labor market with an upward-sloping supply curve.


What does that mean? Why is the supply curve upward-sloping? Because the higher your wage, the more you're willing to work. And we have a downward-sloping demand curve.
Why is it downward sloping? Because the higher the wage, the fewer workers the firm wants to hire. It would rather use machines instead.


So basically, you've got that same supply and demand curve, different stories as to where they come from, but the same effect in terms of determining equilibrium. We get an equilibrium at w1 l*, which is at a wage w1, l* workers are willing to work. Or l* hours are supplied of labor. We think about hours supplied, not necessarily number of workers. l* hours of labor are supplied.


And at that w1, l* workers are willing to provide l* hours, and at that w1, firms demand l* hours, and that's the equilibrium. Same analysis as before, just different stories as to what's behind the curve.


Now, let's say the government rolled in and set, as in Figure 2-5, a minimum wage. The government says, look, that wage w1 is too low-- or w* in this graph-- is too low. Workers are not paid enough in equilibrium. We need to make sure that they get paid a minimum amount. So we are going to mandate that workers cannot be paid below w lower bar, which is critically above w*.


Well, what happens in that case? Well, in that case, at that wage, workers are thrilled. They say, look at that wage. We are delighted to work-- god, the numbers are-- I'm getting old-- ls hours.


I have my prescription for my bifocals. I've had it for, like, two months, and I just can't quite take it to the mall and get them. So eventually I'll get them. I just can't quite admit I'm that old.


So workers are like, great. At that wage, we'll supply l sub s hours. That sounds great to us. We're all good. But the firm says, wait a second. No, we don't want to hire l sub s hours at that wage. That's way too high. We only want to hire at that high wage l sub d hours. So suddenly, here you have a case of excess supply. Not excess demand, excess supply. Workers want to supply more hours than firms want to hire.


Now, in our previous example, what would happen? What would happen is, if there's excess supply-- well, let me ask you. If there's excess supply in the market, how would the market equilibrate? What would happen? Yeah.
AUDIENCE: It would lower the price so that the--



PROFESSOR: In this case, the price is what?



AUDIENCE: The number of--



PROFESSOR: The wage. The wage. So exactly. In our previous example, the wage would fall. Workers would suck it up and get a lower wage. Firms would be happy to pay a lower wage. You'd reach a point where they were happy. You'd reach a point like e. But you can't now.


You can't, because the government said you can't pay less than w lower bar. So you end up with excess supply. And we call that excess supply "unemployment." You end up with unemployment, because at that high wage, firms are not willing to hire as many workers as are willing to work. And you end up in disequilibrium. You end up not in equilibrium but disequilibrium.


Now, disequilibrium is kind of hard to think about, because in some sense, this course is all about equilibrium. So I'm not talking about chaos or cats and dogs living together, breakdown of social order. That's not what I'm talking about. Disequilibrium, there is still a market outcome. The market still settles at a point.


In this case, what happens is the market settles at a wage of w lower bar because it has to and at an amount of labor delivered at l sub s, that low amount of labor delivered. Because when you're in disequilibrium, the outcome of quantity and prices is determined by the constrained party. That's the way I like to think about. You can think about it however you want.


But here's the point. Workers can't work if firms won't hire them. So if you want to say, look, we're going to end up at w lower bar, how much labor is going to be in the market? Well, it's up to the firms. They get to decide.


They're going to say, look, we don't want more than l sub d, so that's how many jobs they're going to provide. So the new outcome is going to be at a wage w lower bar and an amount of hours l sub d. So
basically, you end up with this unemployment situation where only l sub d workers are hired and the wage is w lower bar.


Now, let me ask a question. What would happen if w sub lower bar was set below w*? What if I'd redrawn this diagram so w lower bar was below w*? Yeah.


AUDIENCE: The market would equilibrate and--



PROFESSOR: Yeah, nothing would happen at the end of the day. And here's the key point-- very important point to remember-- which is that markets are very robust. Economic markets are very robust. And if they can undo the effective government intervention, they will. So if the government tries to come and intervene in a way which markets can undo and get back to where they wanted to be, they will.


That original point e is where the market wants to be. That was where it was happy. It can't get there in the example I taught here with w lower bar above w*. But if w lower bar was below w*, it could get there and be happy, so government intervention would make no difference. That's one example of a government intervention.

[[Government Interference: Gasoline Prices]
Let's do another example. Then I want to talk about the pros and cons of these government interventions. Let's do another example. Gas price ceilings. So let's consider a cap on how much can be charged for gas. Seems a pretty sensible policy. Gas is crazy expensive. We all like to drive. So let's consider a cap on the price of gas. Imagine, for example, we're initially in equilibrium, in Figure 2-6, with demand of Q2 and a price of P1. We're all happy.


Now let's imagine there's an oil crisis, because, say, oil companies decide it's a good idea to drill eight miles underground, and everything explodes, and we suddenly run out of oil. So all of a sudden, there's a constraint in the supply. Suddenly, there's a-- I'm sorry, my bad. We're initially in equilibrium at e1. My bad.


We're initially at equilibrium at e1, with a price of P1. There's a bit of mislabeling here. On the vertical axis, that upper price should be P2. So on the vertical axis, you see there's P1 equals P. Then above it, it says P1 again. That should say P2.


So we're initially in equilibrium at point e1 with a price of P1 and a quantity of Q1. Now oil tanks blow up all over the world. Suddenly, that means there's a restriction in the supply of gas. Suddenly, there's not as much gas as can be produced. So that's an upward shift in the supply curve, just like we talked about before.


And absent any government intervention, the supply curve would shift up to s2, consumers would want less gas, and you'd reach a new equilibrium at e2. And once again, let's talk about equilibrium as being where people are happy.


Now, you could say, well gee, people aren't happy paying a higher price for gas. Well, that's why I'm a bit glib using the term "happy." It's a point where the suppliers and demanders are jointly willing to make the deal. And they're willing to make the deal at e2. They're willing to say, look, given how many oil rigs have blown up, we are happy to equilibrate the market now at a higher price and a lower quantity.


But then it's September, 2010. There's an election two months away. President Obama isn't very happy about this. And he says, forget it. We're going to cap the price at P. We were paying P before. We can pay P again.


Those stupid oil companies can suck it up. They're the ones who drilled eight miles underground. They're the ones who blew everything up. They can suck it up. We're keeping the price at P. We'll help the consumer. We'll keep the price.


Well, what happens? What happens is that consumers are now, great, we continue to want Q1. That's where we were before. We're happy. But producers say, well, you know what, President, we can't supply that much at that price. Because it costs us so much to drill oil now that if you're going to force us to keep the price at P1, we are only going to supply Q sub D because we just can't supply at that low price. We're going to supply Q sub D.


So what happens, you end up with excess demand. Consumers want Q sub D gallons. Producers are willing to produce only Q sub S. And you end up with disequilibrium. And in this case, once again, the amount sold is what the producers are willing to sell. It doesn't matter how much consumers want if
producers aren't willing to sell it. You end up with disequilibrium, and you end up with much, much less gas being sold.


So yeah, the price stays low, but the amount of gas being sold is much lower than if the president allowed the price to rise. So that's another example of a government intervention causing disequilibrium. Any questions about that? Yeah.


AUDIENCE: In the last chapter, we talked about, can the government then come in and give a subsidy to the oil producers to produce the same amount?


PROFESSOR: Great. Hold that thought for 14.41. But that's exactly what the government could do. The government has lots of tools. So it can come in and say, well, on the one hand, we'll set a price cap. But then we'll come in on the other hand and give a subsidy to oil producers to make sure they do that.


That has two problems. One is, not so good with the voters. Like, gee, we're going to give subsidies to oil companies. Isn't that a great idea. Two is, you've got to raise the money somehow, which means you've got to raise taxes. Also not so good with the voters.


So it's, in general, not a good idea, because you screw it up on the one hand to screw up again. Two wrongs don't make a right, something I learned from an early age. If the government's messed up the market on the one hand, it's not, generally, a good idea to try to mess with it again to fix that. But that's exactly the kind of stuff we'll discuss in 14.41.


AUDIENCE: I've got a question about that. Will that mean that there's a [INAUDIBLE] because [INAUDIBLE]?


[[Costs and Benefits of Government Intervention]
PROFESSOR: Great segue into what I want to talk about next, which is, what are the costs and benefits of these kinds of market interventions, of a minimum wage or gas price ceiling? Why do we do this? The government, these aren't stupid people, by and large. Why do governments do things like this? What are the costs and benefits?
Now, later in the semester, we'll talk about welfare economics. By welfare, welfare has two meanings. We often think of welfare as being money distributed to poor people. That's one meaning. But when we say "welfare economics," we actually mean the well-being of society. And we'll talk about the well-being of society later on in the semester.


But let's talk for a minute about this general topic. And how do we think about the kind of welfare economics of these restrictions? Well, there's two costs and one benefit to these restrictions. The first cost is the efficiency loss. So the costs of things like the minimum wage and gas price ceilings, the first cost is the efficiency loss.


And we are going to be much more precise. This lecture is sort of a chance to be loosey-goosey about things that I'll then make much more precise throughout the semester. We'll be precise about what we mean by this throughout the semester.


But the key point is, in economics, whenever there is a trade that can be made that makes both parties better off, and it is not made, that is an inefficiency. So in economics, we define "efficient" as when all trades that can make both parties better off are made. And whenever anything comes up that interferes-- so a trade that could make both parties better off is not made-- that is inefficient. There is an efficiency loss.


And think about it. It makes sense. If both parties could be better off by a trade and don't let it happen, then society is worse off. That's the idea of an efficiency loss in economics. Economics is all about trading to make things work more efficiently. When you don't let that happen, you've hurt society. You have a welfare loss, because you have something that could've made both people better off, that would've been a good thing to do. You haven't allowed that to happen.


And if we think about it, in both these examples, Figure 2-5 and 2-6, there are trades that would've made both parties better off that we're not allowing to happen. So in the labor market case, think about a wage that's above w* and below w lower bar. So a wage in that interval.


At that wage, workers would be happy-- and take unemployed workers. Unemployed workers would be happy to work it a wage somewhat below w bar. Firms would be happy to hire them at a wage somewhat below w lower bar. But it isn't happening, because the government has interfered. That's an efficiency loss.


Likewise, look at Figure 2-6. Consumers would be happy to pay a somewhat higher price and get some more gas. Producers would be happy to produce more at that higher price. But it's not happening. That's an efficiency loss. So an efficiency loss is whenever there are trades that can make both sides better off that don't happen.


Once again, this is loosey-goosey here. We'll make this all more precise as the semester goes on. But it's important to get the big picture concept of what we mean by efficiency in economics, which is trades being made that make both parties better off.


The second cost here is what we call "allocation inefficiency." Remember in the first lecture, I talked about how prices play three roles in the market. They determine what is to be produced, they determine how it is to be produced, and they determine who gets it. That's called "allocation." Price plays a critical role in making sure that the people who want the good the most get it.


Because remember, that demand curve is a willingness-to-pay curve, or a willingness-to-buy curve. What that lets us know is the further up the demand curve, the more people want the good. And we should make sure that those people are allocated that good.


So in a world of equilibrium, we make sure that the allocation happens. Anybody who wants the good at a price that consumers are willing to sell it gets it. Someone who doesn't want it at that price doesn't get it. Equilibrium takes care of that allocation problem.


But in disequilibrium, it doesn't. Let's consider the gasoline example. Now we have a case where there are many, many people-- in fact, all the folks who lie between Qs and Qd on that x-axis-- all those folks want gas at that low price but can't get it. There's only Qs being supplied. So what happens? Well, what happened-- you guys weren't alive for this, but in the 1970s, does anyone know what happened when we did price ceilings of this type? Does anyone know what happened?


AUDIENCE: Gas shortage.



PROFESSOR: Gas shortage. And how did people respond? How was gas allocated in that gas shortage?


AUDIENCE: There were lines.



PROFESSOR: Peopled waited in huge lines. Basically, we couldn't use the price mechanism, so what did we do? We used the wait mechanism, just like they used to do in Russia all the time and still do. The point is the gas that's limited-- that Qs-- has got to get allocated somehow. In the market, it gets allocated by the price rising until the price is high enough that the set of people who want it at that price get it. With this gas price ceiling, that can't happen.


So what happens? Lines for gas. Huge, hours-long wait. This is sort of inconceivable now. Sometimes, you have to wait at a gas pump, but pretty much, you drive up, you get your gas, you leave. In the 1970s, literally, you would wait hours-- multiple hours-- in line to get gas. That was how the gas was allocated in the face of these gas price ceilings. Yeah.


AUDIENCE: What about things like the government saying you can't shut off someone's gas in the winter, even if there was a price ceiling?


PROFESSOR: OK, let me come back to that. Hold that thought for a couple minutes. I want to come back to that. But I want to focus on these gas price lines and why they're bad. Well, these gas price lines are themselves a source of inefficiency. And why? Why is it inefficient to have people waiting in line for gas? Yeah.


AUDIENCE: Because they could be working or doing other things.



PROFESSOR: They could be working. They could be out making trades that make everybody better off. Instead of being in line waiting for gas, they could've been at work, working for a wage that they were happy to earn and their employer was happy to pay. So a trade is not being made. Unless they're equally happy sitting in line waiting for gas, which is doubtful, a trade is not being made, which makes both parties better off. What else?


AUDIENCE: I have a question. Did the government know about this?


PROFESSOR: Yeah, believe me, they did. But they said, well gee, we can't let people pay those high prices. Governments face really hard decisions like this all the time. There's another program, of course, which is, what happens with people waiting in line for gas? They're idling and using up gas. So in fact, there was a direct mechanical inefficiency as well, which is all the gas that was wasted while people idled in line, waiting to get their gas.


So that's the kind of inefficiency you're used to thinking about as engineers. There's a mechanical inefficiency, but the main thing we care about is the allocative inefficiency, which is trades are not being made because people are sitting in their cars waiting for gas. And that's inefficiency. And that inefficiency arises because we have to allocate the gas somehow.


You can't get around that problem. Remember, we are the dismal science. We point out problems that cannot be surmounted. You can't get around that problem. That gas has to get allocated somehow. And if you don't let the price mechanism allocate it, some other, more inefficient mechanism will arise to do so.


Now, the trade-off, of course, is then you keep the price low. And the government's got to decide-- once again, this gets into the political economy of how the governments make these decisions. And that's not really the point of this course. But that's the kind of decision they have to make. Now let's come-- and this will touch on your question-- oh, do you have a question about this?


AUDIENCE: I have a question, actually, about the minimum wage. So isn't it a little imbalanced, because when people need work more than companies need people-- because, for example, there are a lot of instances when companies are paying hunger wages, a dollar a day. [INAUDIBLE] they're not happy for it.


PROFESSOR: Yeah, basically, in some sense, the bottom line is, equilibrium is where people are going to work for what the company's willing to pay. Now, you can say, if people want work when the company wants to offer it, that's sort of a difficult subjective judgment. But at the end of the day, if people are willing to work for a dollar and the company's willing to hire them for a dollar, then that's a trade which should be made. Except, that's a great example to point out-- same person who just said that, well then, tell me what's the benefit of a minimum wage?
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]



PROFESSOR: It's equity, that thing economists like to not think about, because it's tricky. It's fairness. It's equity. It's unfair that you would work for a dollar a day. And people might be exploited and work for unfairly low wages. Likewise, it's unfair that we pay a huge amount for gas. So people, we should keep the wage high and the prices low to make it fair. And that's the pro of the minimum wage. Yeah.


AUDIENCE: I didn't quite get [INAUDIBLE] it is giving a few people a higher wage, right? But it's causing unemployment, so how is that better?


PROFESSOR: Wonderful point. Wonderful point. That's because in economics, there's the direct effect and the indirect effect. And the direct effect is what voters understand. And the indirect effect is what we understand. In the case of gas, it was easy to see. The question, why didn't the government realize this? Everyone saw the direct effect, which was low prices, and indirect effect, which was long lines.


With a minimum wage, it's harder, because there's lots of reasons for unemployment, not just the minimum wage. So the indirect effect is a lot harder to see. If you're a politician, you're saying, look, I'll raise the minimum wage. I'll make sure you're paid more. Everybody goes, yay. And then the economist says, well, you have to understand, according to this diagram, that would lead to unemployment. People are like, whatever. Shut up.


So basically, the point is that, basically, yes, you're right. But for perceived equity, this is the case. But you're right. There's a trade-off. Just like they recognize the trade between the price and the lines, there's a trade-off between the higher wage and the employment. And that comes so what we'll talk about, empirical economics, which is measuring that trade-off.


Well, how big is that trade-off? How much unemployment does a higher minimum wage cause? In fact, we'll learn in about nine lectures that it actually doesn't cause that much unemployment. It actually doesn't. So maybe the trade-off isn't that bad. But in principle, there's a trade-off.


Now, that comes to your point about shutting people's water off and things like that, and the government making sure that the suppliers make sure people's water doesn't get shut off. Once again, one way to do that is just say to the water company, you can't shut people's water off, even if they don't
pay their bills. Well, that's going to mean the water company's going to lose money on those people. That'll raise the cost of supplying water, and that will lead to the same kind of problems we've talked about.


AUDIENCE: But if a price cap and a--



PROFESSOR: But if the government then says, OK, a price cap, and then we're going to pay you for the people who don't pay, that's kind of like the idea before. You can have these countervailing interventions. But then it starts to get messy. You've got to raise the money to pay them, et cetera.


So that's why equity is so hard. If it's efficiency, it's easy. You just don't do anything. With equity, it gets a lot harder, because government has to intervene to address equity, and then that causes other problems. It causes these equity efficiency trade-offs. And that's a lot of the problems it raises.

[[Government Intervention: Water Shortages]
So now let's talk about one last example to stop. I don't have a diagram for this one, but let's talk about the great example-- it's a real world example that happens a lot-- which is water shortages. How many people here from California? You guys know water shortages. You guys know about how this works. You guys know the drill. Which is that there'll be a drought, and the government will say, you can only use x gallons per day.


You can't water your lawn or-- actually, let me ask the Californians. So does the government monitor your meter or just tell you? Is it enforced?


AUDIENCE: Tells us.



PROFESSOR: Just tells you. So the government says, you can't do this, you can't do that. Maybe they enforce it. Maybe they don't. Whatever. But the government comes in and says, look, there's not enough water. So as a result, we are going to limit your use of water. Yeah.


AUDIENCE: They also have tiered pricing.
PROFESSOR: OK, hold on. Time out. That's because the government got smart. So let's go back 10 years ago. So what they'll do is they'll come in, and they'll say, you can't use as much water.


Now, this has two problems, just like we talked about. First of all, there are households which would happily pay more to make sure they got to use the same amount of water. And those trades are not being made. The first inefficiency. Moreover, it's got the problem that you're not allocating the water appropriately. Some guys are just dirty and don't like to shower. Some guys are clean and care a lot about showering. I want to allocate the water to the clean guys.


But the government typically doesn't do that. It just says, don't use more than x gallons. So there's an allocation inefficiency as well, where the people that value the water the most aren't getting it the most. Now, tell me about tiered pricing.


AUDIENCE: So it's like if you use 0 to 80 gallons per year or per month or whatever, you pay a certain price. And then if you use 81 to 120, you pay extra on those gallons. And then you pay even more down-
-



PROFESSOR: Exactly. So what the government can do-- the right answer is that the government can use the price mechanism to deal with the shortage. And the way it can do that is by saying, we're going to let the price increase. We're going to let the price increase, and we are going to allow the price to be a function. You see us pricing, but you make that a function of the underlying conditions and water supply.


So basically, you have a tiered pricing, and if there's a drought, the prices all go up. So the government sets the price for water, and it says, look, the price this year will be higher if there's a drought. And what that will do is that will make sure whoever wants the water gets the water and makes sure we allocate it to the people who need it the most.


Can anyone think of another way you can do this? Never really worked in reality, but it's kind of a fun way to think about it. Well, imagine that what I did is I said, every Californian gets a certain amount of water permits. Every Californian gets-- I don't know how many gallons of water people use. I don't know. You get 1,000 gallon a year water permit. How many gallons of water people use in a year? I've got no idea. 1,000? Let's say 1,000.


1,000 gallon a year water permit. We're going to give you 1,000 pieces of paper. Each one permits you to use a gallon of water. Now, what we're going to let you do is trade those pieces of paper with your neighbors. So what we're going to do is we're going to say, in normal times, basically, there's enough water, everyone gets 1,000.


Then we're going to say, when times are tight that basically, you can only use 900 gallons. So what that's going to mean is that you're going to have to have permits that allow you to use those gallons. And you're going to have to buy those permits off your neighbors. So basically, we can allow neighbors to trade.


And the neighbor that says, I don't care about water so much-- so what's going to happen now is the government's going to say, this year, we only issue 900 gallon permits to each of you, instead of 1,000. Now, you're a clean person. You say, wait a second, I wanted to use 1,000 gallons. So you go to your neighbor and say, look, you're dirty. You don't need more than 800 gallons. Sell me your extra hundred.


The government gave you 900. I want my 1,000. The government gave me 900. Sell me your extra 100. The neighbors says, sure. And they set a price, and they sell to you, and it works out to be exactly the same outcome as if the government had used the proper pricing, because that secondary market-- somebody asked about black markets-- this secondary market can evade the government regulation.


So once again, the market equilibrium is very robust. And if you can figure out a way to evade the government regulation, you will. If there's some way with permits, if there's some way to trade-- now, in reality, you can't really trade water. But if you could, then you could use a market mechanism to overcome this problem. Yeah.


AUDIENCE: Is that what-- one of the suggestions was for the global warming type thing, the carbon credits--


PROFESSOR: Exactly. So global warming-- actually, I flew with Al Gore over to Kyoto in 1997 and negotiated the global warming treaty. So something near and dear to my heart. And with global warming, that's exactly the solution that's part of the Kyoto protocol, the framework that was set up at
that meeting, which is that basically, there will be a certain limit on how much carbon dioxide can be emitted into the air. But there'll be permits, and countries can actually trade across each other.


And the idea is, look, in the US, it's incredibly expensive to reduce the emissions we have. Because what you have to do is you have to take a coal-fired plant and retrofit it to use natural gas instead. Well, in China, they haven't built the plant yet. They're building the plant. And it's not that much more expensive to build it to be natural gas instead of coal.


So in China, it's pretty cheap to reduce emissions. You just say, OK, I was going to build a coal. I'll build a natural gas instead. It's pretty much the same cost. I've just reduced emissions. So the idea is that we would trade with China, we would pollute more, China would pollute less, but the global total would be the same.


Now, as you hear that, you might think that's kind of controversial. But in fact, it makes total sense. Just like it might be controversial that dirty neighbors are selling water to clean neighbors. You can imagine the newspaper articles, the outrage. People forced to be dirty to make ends meet. But that's not right. What's right is you want to allocate to people for whom it's most efficient.


It is more efficient for China to reduce emissions because it's cheaper than for the US to reduce emissions. So the efficient system, we say, here's the total amount of emissions we're going to reduce, and we're going to let China do extra reduction, or pollute less, and the US gets to continue our slovenly ways, and that's the efficient outcome.


One last thing on this note. Many of you may know who Larry Summers is. Larry Summers was actually my thesis adviser who then went on to be Secretary of the Treasury, had a somewhat failed stint as president of Harvard and is now Obama's top economic advisor. Well, Larry Summers has gotten himself in trouble two times. You all know about the time he said women are stupid.


But the other time he got himself in trouble was in 1990, he actually signed his name to a memo. He didn't actually write it. Signed his name to a memo saying that the efficient thing to do is we should ship all our garbage to poor countries. And he said that's efficient because poor countries, what do they have? They have lots of space and not much money. What do we have? Lots of money and not much space. So the efficient thing to do is we should take our garbage and put on barges and send it to Africa.


He was right. That is the efficient thing to do. Africans would be better off, because they have lots of space they're not using, and they'd be richer. The US would be better off, because we would be able to get rid of our garbage, and we're happy to pay to do it. That's the trade to make it better off.


And yet, it got him fired, writing that memo. That's why economics is the dismal science, because we point out things like this. All right, let me stop there, and we'll come back on Wednesday and start talking in more detail about consumer demand.

PROFESSOR: So today what we're going to do is continue our discussion of supply and demand. This is sort of introduction week, if you will. We've kind of talked about supply and demand, and you guys, rightly, immediately were on to where do those curves come from. And that's what we'll start next week. But what I want to do today is talk some more about what determines the shapes of supply and demand curves and just think about an overview of how we think about supply and demand interacting in a market and what determines how responsive individuals and firms are to prices.


And, once again, remember everyone should have a handout that you should have picked up in the back on your way in. So everyone should have a handout. What we talked about last time was the sort of qualitative effects, the qualitative version of the supply and demand model. We talked about what happens when a supply curve shifts, what happens when a demand curve shifts. We talked about how either a supply shock or a demand shock could lead to the price being increased. But they could have very different effects on quantity, et cetera.


What we didn't talk about is how big these effects are. I made up some numbers. I threw them on the graphs. But I didn't talk about where the size of those effects come from. And where they come from is the shapes of the supply and demand curve. And that's what we'll talk about today is what determines the shapes of supply and demand curves. And that will be the focus of today's lecture. I'll talk both theoretically about what determines these shapes and empirically about how economists go about figuring out the shapes of supply and demand curves.


So, to think about this, let's start with Figure 3-1, which is a standard market diagram we had last time. With an initial equilibrium at point E1, with an initial price P1 and a quantity Q1. That's the equilibrium that's stable. Because at that price P1, consumers demand Q1 units, and suppliers are willing to provide Q1 units. So that's a stable equilibrium.
Now we have some supply shift. Last time we talked about somehow a pork-specific drought. That leads the supply to shift inward. So the supply curve rises to S2. At that new price, initially, you would have excess demand. But quickly the price increases to shut off that excess demand. And you end up with a new equilibrium with a higher price, P2, and a lower quantity Q2, and new equilibrium point E2. OK?
And we talked that through last time.



What I want to talk about this time is well, what determines the size of that shift from Q1 to Q2 and that price increase from P1 to P2? What's going to determine it is the elasticity of supply and demand. The elasticity of supply and demand is how much do supply and demand respond? Do the quantities supplied and the quantities demanded respond when the price changes?


When we say, how elastic is demand, what we mean is how sensitive to price is the quantity demanded. Or, alternatively, what is the slope of that demand curve? So the slope of the demand curve will be the sensitivity of quantity demanded to the price consumers face. And that will determine the market responsiveness.


In economics, it's always true that the best way to think about things is to go to extremes. You have to remember that extremes don't exist in the real world. But it's a useful teaching device to think about extremes.


So let's think about one extreme case in Figure 3-2. Let's think about the case of perfectly inelastic demand. Perfectly inelastic demand, that's where there's no elasticity of demand. What that means is that demand for a good is unchanged regardless of the price. So perfectly inelastic demand is a case where demand for the good is unchanged regardless of the price. That would lead you to have a vertical demand curve at a given quantity. What this says is regardless of the price, people always demand Q.


Can anyone tell me what would cause demand to be perfectly inelastic? In what types of situations would demand be-- it's never perfectly inelastic-- would demand be relatively inelastic? Yeah?


AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].



PROFESSOR: It's all about substitutes. When there's no substitutes, when there's nowhere to go, it doesn't matter what the price is. When there's no substitutes, demand will be perfectly inelastic,
because you have to have Q. It doesn't matter what the price is. Because there's no substitute for that good. So if you wanted amount Q of that good for any reason, you're always going to want that amount Q no matter the price.


So a perfectly inelastic good would have no substitutes. So you'd always want Q no matter what. Can anyone think of an example? There's no perfectly inelastic good in the world. But what sorts of goods? Yeah?


AUDIENCE: Medicines.



PROFESSOR: Medicines. Now, not necessarily all medicines. So give me an example of a medicine which would be more or less inelastic. So I don't even need a medical name. What sort of treatments?


AUDIENCE: Like heart attack maybe?



PROFESSOR: Yeah, something which is sort of lifesaving. The best thing that we often use is insulin for diabetics. Diabetics without getting that insulin to manage their diabetes will die. That seems like that's something where there's not a whole lot of substitutes. The substitute is dying. So basically that's where demand is relatively inelastic. Or a heart transplant, when you get a heart transplant or any kind of transplant, you have medicine you take so you don't reject the transplanted organ. That sort of medicine demand should be very inelastic.


Elastic drug, well, our favorite example is always Viagra. It's something where you'd think that you can probably survive without it. And people would want less Viagra if you charged a lot more for it than if you charged less for it. So elasticity is going to be about substitutability. And that's going to determine inelastic demand.


Now, what happens with inelastic demand when there's a supply shock? When supply increases, what happens? Well, in that case, there can never be excess demand, because demand doesn't change. So all that happens is price just increases. If there's inelastic demand, and there's a supply shock, then all that happens is an increase in price and no change in quantity. So with inelastic demand, quantity doesn't change for a price increase. Price just goes up. From a supply shock, prices just goes up.


Now, let's consider the opposite. Let's look at Figure 3-3 and think about perfectly elastic demand. Perfectly elastic demand is demand where consumers, essentially, don't care about the quantity. They just care about the price. That is, there are infinitely good substitutes. A perfectly elastically demanded good would be one where there are, essentially, perfect substitutes. An inelastic good is where there's no substitute. A perfectly elastic good would be where there's perfect substitutes.


Technically, if a good is perfectly elastically demanded, then you are completely indifferent between that good and a substitute. Well, if you're completely indifferent, then if the price changed at all, you would immediately switch. And so the price can't change.


What's an example? Once again, there's no good example of a perfectly elastic good. Yeah?



AUDIENCE: Candy.



PROFESSOR: What?



AUDIENCE: Candy.



PROFESSOR: Candy. OK. So you've got your Wrigley's gum. I like the sugar-free, minty gum. You've got Orbit and Eclipse. And I go to the store, and they're all pretty much the same price. If Orbit was more than Eclipse, I just buy Eclipse. They're the same. They're minty gum. It doesn't make a difference. So basically the price is the same.


If there's a supply shock, I don't know, they're made with the same shit. But let's say that Eclipse has some magic ingredient. And let's say the Eclipse magic ingredient got more expensive, so the supply curve shifted up. Well, Eclipse could not respond by raising its price. Because I just switched to Orbit.


Or we often think of McDonald's and Burger King. Now, they're less perfect substitutes, but pretty perfect. If McDonald's started charging $10 for a hamburger, you wouldn't go there anymore. You'd go to Burger King.


So if there's a supply shock to a provider  that's facing a perfectly elastic demand curve, they cannot raise their price, because people will just switch. So quantity will fall a lot. Because if I'm supplying Eclipse gum, and it suddenly costs a lot more to produce Eclipse gum, but I can't raise my price, because I will lose all my business to Orbit, I'm just going to produce a lot less Eclipse. Because I'm losing money now.


So with perfectly inelastic demand, the quantity didn't change. With perfectly elastic demand, we saw a big quantity change. So, more generally, what determines the quantity change in response to a price change is the elasticity. More generally, we're between these two cases of perfectly elastic and perfectly inelastic. And what's going to determine the price change is going to be the price elasticity of demand epsilon which is going to be the percentage change in quantity for each percentage change in price or, in calculus terms, dQ/dP. So it's, basically, the percentage change in quantity for the percentage change in price.


So, for example, if for every 1% increase in price quantity falls 2%, that is a price elasticity of demand of minus 2. The price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity for the percentage change in price.


So inelastic demand is an epsilon of 0. There is no change in quantity when price changes. Perfectly elastic demand is an epsilon of negative infinity. Any epsilon change in price leads to a negative infinite change in quantity. Immediately, the quantity goes to 0 if you try to raise your price.


So the price elasticity of demand will typically be between 0 and negative infinity. And the larger it is the more quantity will change when prices change. Questions about that? Yeah?


AUDIENCE: So that formula, shouldn't it be dQ/dP times P/Q because dQ/dP just refers to the change of the quantity with respect to price, not necessarily the percent change.


PROFESSOR: Yeah, you're right. I was trying to get too fancy with my calculus. You're right. Let's just stick with the non-calculus formula. I never should deviate from my notes. So let's just stick with the non- calculus formula. OK, other questions about this? OK. So, basically, that's the elasticity. That's going to be the elasticity.


Now, an interesting point about elasticity is now, we're not going to get into producer theory for a couple of lectures. But as a little peek ahead about producer theory, let's think about how elasticity determines the money that producers make from selling their goods.


Well, if a producer sells Q goods at a price P, they make revenues R. Revenues are the price times the quantity. The amount of money a producer makes when it sells goods, its revenues, this isn't its profits. We're not having profits. It's just the amount of money it makes, not the amount of money it takes home at the end of the day. I'm ignoring the cost of making the goods. The amount of total revenues it makes is price times quantity.


Well, we can then say that the change in revenues with respect to price is what? It's Q plus dQ, plus delta Q-- let me put it this way to make my math clearer-- plus P times delta Q over delta P. That's how revenues change with respect to price. Or, in other words, plugging in from the elasticity formula, delta R over delta P equals Q times 1 plus epsilon.


So, in other words, what this says is that if you're a producer, and you're trying to decide whether to raise your price, whether that will increase revenues, it all depends on the elasticity. If the elasticity is between 0 and minus 1, then raising prices will raise revenues. If the elasticity is greater than minus 1, then raising prices will lower revenues.


We're often faced with the issue of why did they charge this much for this good, or should they raise their prices or not raise their price. Well, that's all about the elasticity of demand. The elasticity of demand will determine whether they're going to make more money by raising their price or lose money by raising their price.


For Eclipse gum, their elasticity of demand is well above minus 1 in absolute value, so they're going to lose money by raising their price. If they take the current level of Eclipse, for every penny they raise, they'll lose money. For insulin, for every penny they raise, they'll make money.


And then you might say well, then how come the price of insulin isn't infinity and the price of Eclipse gum isn't zero? Well, that's what we'll talk about in a few weeks. Because it also depends on the costs of
producing it. But at the end of the day, that's what's going to determine the money that's made by producers when they change their prices. Questions about that?

[[Using Empirical Economics to Determine Elasticity]]
OK. So now, that's how we think about the shape of supply and demand. The shape of supply and demand is determined by these elasticities. So now we have to get into OK, well, where do we get these elasticities from? And that is the main topic of empirical economics which is estimating these kinds of elasticities, estimating these types of elasticities.


So one of the first distinctions I drew in the lectures is between theoretical economics and empirical economics. Theoretical economics can tell us this is what a graph looks like and supply and demand. Theoretical economics can't really tell us how big, for example, an elasticity is going to be. It can tell us, there's more substitutes or less substitutes so we can rank them. We know the elasticity for Eclipse gum has got to be higher than the elasticity for insulin.


But from the theoretical model, we can't say what the elasticity actually is. To say what an elasticity actually is, we need to go to an empirical model. We actually need to bring data to bear on the question.


And this is very difficult. Because here we face the fundamental conundrum facing the empirical economist which is distinguishing causation from correlation. And the whole guts of empirical economics is all about this question, distinguishing causation from correlation.


The classic story that illustrates this, it's due to my colleague, Frank Fisher, from a textbook many years ago, was the story of in ancient Russia there was a cholera outbreak, and many people were dying. So the government decided to send doctors out to try to solve the problem. And where there were more people sick, they sent more doctors.


Well, the peasants said, wait a second. We observe that where there's more doctors, more people are dying from cholera. So the doctors must be causing the cholera. So they rose up and killed the doctors.


The peasants confused causation with correlation. They thought that the fact that you saw more people dying where there's more doctors meant that doctors were causing the disease. Clearly that's wrong.
That's why they were peasants. But it's not just peasants that make this mistake.


For example, in 1988, Harvard University, our illustrious neighbor to the south, I guess, west, east, I don't know. Which way is Harvard? I don't know directions, down the street. A Harvard University dean conducted an interview with a set of freshmen. And they found that those that had taken SAT preparation courses-- now, you all took SAT preparation courses. But in 1988, not everyone did. Those who'd taken SAT preparation courses scored an average of 63 points lower-- this was back when the SAT was 1600 points-- 63 points lower on their SATs then those that had not taken preparation courses.


The dean concluded that preparation courses were unhelpful, and that the testing industry was preying on the insecurities of students to provide a useless service. Why was the dean confusing causation with correlation? What did the dean get wrong in drawing that conclusion? Yeah?


AUDIENCE: What had probably happened is the students who got worse scores realized that they wanted to try and improve their scores by taking an SAT prep class. So that's why there is a lower average score for the people who had taken the class.


PROFESSOR: Generally, the people who needed the help the most took the most courses. And so they had an underlying lower score. So, in fact, you can't tell anything from the fact that the people who took the prep course scored worse. It's just another excellent example of confusing causation with correlation. And that's another example.


Another example I like quite a lot is studies of breastfeeding. There are numbers of studies of breastfeeding, especially in developing countries, where they found that the longer children were breastfed the sicker they were. So they concluded that breastfeeding was bad for kids. Well, that's not the truth. The truth is the sicker kids need to be breastfed more, because breastfeeding is actually good for kids. And they just confused the causation with the correlation.


Now, these are all fun examples. But the truth is this is a common mistake made by citizens, policy makers, everyone in the real world. It's taking two things that move together and assuming one causes the other. And this is the fundamental conundrum facing empirical economics in trying to address these kinds of things like measuring elasticities.
So to understand that, let's think about the issue of trying to estimate the elasticity of demand for pork. Let's say you have the exciting job of estimating the elasticity of demand for pork. That's your assignment. Well, you say, wait a second. What we learned in class, as shown in Figure 3-4, is that the price of pork can rise for very different reasons.


Figure 3-4, we start at an initial equilibrium like E1 with a quantity like Q1 and a price P1. Now, imagine that there was a shift in demand, because the price of beef rose, remember? The price of beef rose.
That shifted demand from D1 to D2. What did that lead to? A higher price and a higher quantity.



So if you took that diagram-- forget the supply shift for a minute, just imagine that's the change-- and you said, aha. I can measure the elasticity. I see here there's a change in price. I can then look at how quantity changed. And I'll get the elasticity right after all. It's delta Q over Q or delta P over P.


So I just look, and I take Q2 prime minus Q1 over Q1. That's the percentage change in Q. I take P2 over P1 over P1. That's the percentage change in price. And what do I get? A wrong signed elasticity is what I get. I get a positive elasticity, because Q is going up and P is going up. Why? Because I'm confusing causation with correlation.


It's not the price change that caused quantity to change. In fact, it's the opposite. It's a taste shift, which caused quantity to increase which drove up the price. It was a demand increase which caused the quantity demanded to increase which drove up the price. So it's the quantity driving the price, not the price driving the quantity.


So if you looked at that simple example, as many people in the real world do, they'd say, hey, look. Higher prices cause higher quantities. You're getting the wrong answer. Because you're confusing correlation which is the higher price is correlated with the higher quantity. Because there was a common factor causing both of them which is the demand shift and not causation. The higher price did not cause the higher quantity.


What do we need to do? We need to distinguish why the price increased. We need to distinguish why the price increased to measure this. If, instead, we looked at a shift in supply such as the case that's shifting from S1 to S2 and moving the equilibrium from E1 to E2, then you would get the right answer. Because then you'd say, look. Something independent to consumers shifted up the price. Some shock to the supply of pork shifted up the price. And we saw that their quantity fell as a result.


What's the key? The key is that to measure an elasticity of demand, you're measuring the slope of the demand curve. So you need to shift along a demand curve, not shift the demand curve itself.


So if you look at this figure, what's the concept we want? We want the slope of the demand curve. Well, you get that by shifting from E1 to E2, because you shift along the demand curve. So by looking at what happens to quantity as price rises from E1 to E2, you get the slope of the demand curve. You get that delta Q over delta P you want.


But from E1 to E2 prime, you're not shifting along the demand curve. You're actually measuring the elasticity of supply. You're measuring the elasticity of supply. You're shifting along a supply curve. So you're actually answering a different question, a relevant question, but a different one. That question is, what's the elasticity of supply? How willing are pork producers to supply pork as the price goes up?


So it's the same delta Q over delta P. But here we did the elasticity of demand. There's a corresponding elasticity of supply which is measured the same way. It's delta Q over delta P, but it's for a different kind of shock. It's what you get from moving along the supply curve.


So if we went from E1 to E2 prime, we can use that to measure the elasticity of supply or the slope of the supply curve. And we do that if something shifts demand to move us along the supply curve. From E1 to E2, we measure the elasticity of demand as something shifts supply and moves us along the demand curve.

[[Elasticity and Taxation]]
So what we need to measure the elasticity of demand is something which shifts supply but does not, itself, affect demand. And the best example of this that we use in economics, a great example, is government policy which comes along and changes the supply conditions for a good.


So, for example, let's think about a tax on pork. So if you go to Figure 3-5, imagine the government came along and taxed pork. The government comes along and taxes pork. Let's think about what a tax on pork does.
The government comes along, and let's say the pork market is initially in equilibrium at $3.30 with 220 million kilograms of pork sold. Now the government comes along and says that it's going to charge $1.05 in tax for every kilogram of pork. So it's going to impose a tax of $1.05 per kilogram on producers. So it's saying to producers of pork, for every kilogram of pork you sell, you have to send a check to the government for $1.05. For every kilogram of pork you sell, you have to send a check to the government for $1.05.


Now, somebody talk me through how a supplier thinks through that. How does a supplier react to that? What do they think? They're initially happy at E1 selling 220 million kilograms at $3.30. What happens when the government comes in and says you have to pay $1.05 for every kilogram of pork you sell?
What happens? Yeah.



AUDIENCE: The producer decides that the current amount of money they have will not be able to buy as much inputs to create their products. So they can produce less.


PROFESSOR: Exactly. So, in other words, the cost of producing just rose. So what do they do? So, in other words, what they say is look, effectively, if I was happy before selling 220 million kilograms at
$3.30, to keep me equally happy selling 220 million kilograms, I'm going to have to raise the price. We should add this to graph, actually.


If you draw a vertical line up for me, one to the S2 curve. Draw a little dashed line up from the E1 to the S2 curve and then over. That price intersection will be $4.35. So in other words, if you want me to keep producing 220 million kilograms of pork, I'm going to have to get $4.35 a kilogram. And you might say, what gives you the right to get that? And it's not about rights. It's about what producers are willing to do.


That same mathematics, that same supply curve that tells us they're willing to sell 220 million kilograms at $3.30 says, if you want them to keep selling 220 million kilograms but also pay $1.05 to the government, they're going to have to get $4.35 a kilogram.


So what happens is that's a supply shift. And with the same reaction we saw last time with the drought, the price goes up, consumers demand less, and you reach a new equilibrium at the price E2. You reach a new equilibrium where you sell 206 million kilograms for a price of $4.00.


So someone tell me how I use this example to find elasticity of demand. Yeah.



AUDIENCE: I guess you need to know that the change in price traveled along the demand curve. So you know that it's not [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].


PROFESSOR: OK, so tell me. You don't have to do the math in your head. But how would I compute it?



AUDIENCE: You would take E1 and E2, and then you would do the price over the quantity change.



PROFESSOR: Right, exactly. So the quantity change delta Q over Q, is what? It's minus 14 over 220. It fell by 14 million kilograms over 220. The price change, delta P over P, the price rose from $3.30 to $4.00. So the price change is $0.70 over $3.30.


And using those, you end up with a price elasticity of minus 0.3. Or, in other words, there's a 6.4% change in quantity. This is minus 6.4% for a 21% change in price. So quantity falls by 6.4% when price goes up by 21%. That's a price elasticity of minus 0.3. Or that's a relatively inelastic demand. It's not perfectly inelastic, but it's relatively inelastic. In other words, at that point, pork producers could make money by raising the price.


Now, you might say well, why didn't they? That's something we'll discuss in a couple weeks. But at that point, demand is relatively inelastic. And you've got a convincing estimate, because you moved along that demand curve. You used the supply shift.


Now, we're going to talk about taxation much, much later in the semester. Let me just talk for one minute about what we learned from this graph. What happens? Well, the shaded area is the money the government raises from its tax. The government has a tax of $1.05 at 206 million kilograms. So it raises
$1.05 times 206 million kilograms which is that shaded area.
There are two points to note the we'll come back to later in the semester. The first point to note is the amount of money the government raises will depend directly on the elasticity of demand. Can anyone tell me how much money the government would raise if you had a perfectly inelastic demand? Yeah.


AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].



PROFESSOR: Right. If we think about this demand curve being perfectly flat, if we think about this demand curve being perfectly flat, then basically the producer can't charge any more for their good. So it's going to depend on whether the producer is willing to sell at $1.05 less and how much less they're willing to sell. If they're willing to sell a lot less, they're going to make a lot less money.


It's going to be where that second supply curve intersects a flat demand curve. So that quantity is going to be a lot smaller. We don't have it on the diagram. But you see where that dashed line at $3.30 intersects S2, that's way to the left. Quantity is going to fall a ton in this market. When quantity falls, the government is going to raise a lot less money. Because the government raises $1.05 on every unit sold at the end.


So if the government taxes very elastically demanded goods, it's going to raise less money. If it taxes inelastically demanded goods like insulin, it's going to raise more money, because the quantity doesn't change. Yeah.


AUDIENCE: So cigarettes are relatively inelastic.



PROFESSOR: Yes, exactly. Cigarettes are relatively inelastic. The elasticity is around minus 0.5. So the government will actually raise money by raising the cigarette tax.


Those of us, as good liberals, think we should tax yachts. Let's tax yachts. Only rich guy have yachts. The problem is yachts are incredibly elastically demanded. So you raise a lot less money taxing yachts than you think. Because guys buy fewer yachts, and you don't raise as much money as you think you would. You still raise some, and it still may be worth it. But you raise less than you think. So that's one sort of observation about this. It's basically how much money you'll raise will be a function of how elastic the demand is.


The other important observation to make is why it's actually hard for governments to figure out how much money they're going to raise for a tax. Because, to figure it out, they need to know these elasticities. That is, the naive thing to do would have been to say what? Well, we're selling 220 million kilograms of pork. That's $1.05. We're going to tax each kilogram. So that's 220 million times $1.05. And that's how much money we raise. Well, that's wrong, we know, because that assumes inelastic demand. If demand's elastic, they'll raise less than that.


Well, if we want to figure out how much a government is going to raise from a tax, they've got to know what these elasticities are. And those are actually pretty hard things to know. So that's why there's uncertainty. That's why when politicians will say, this tax will raise x and you'll hear the New York Times report, the tax will raise x, that is a guess. Those are guesses, because they depend on our best estimate of the key elasticities that determine how people respond. Yeah.


AUDIENCE: But in Washington you have tax cuts that raise money.



PROFESSOR: Well, some claim you do. You don't actually. But some claim you have tax cuts that raise money. That's because they think the elasticity is very large. If the elasticity is large enough, a tax cut can raise money. So, basically, that's all about that some people think that elasticities are large enough that tax cuts can raise money. Those people are wrong. But that's what they claim. Yeah.


AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].



PROFESSOR: Yes. Excellent point. You'll go through that in section on Friday. So what I've done is I've done an example of a constant elasticity curve. Actually, I've done something here which is logically inconsistent. This curve is linear which means it can't be constant elasticity. If it's constant elasticity, it would have to curve.


So what I've estimated here is a local elasticity. I have estimated the elasticity around that price change. But the elasticity, if this curve is true, would be different at different points on this curve. If the elasticity is going to be constant all over the curve, and you're going to do a constant elasticity of demand, that's going to be a curve that bends, not a linear curve. So a linear demand curve is not constant elasticity of demand.


We will typically ignore that issue and focus on local elasticities. But that is an important issue. We'll discuss that in section on Friday, the difference between constant elasticity of demand curves and linear demand curves. But, typically, we're think about local changes. So if it's local enough, it doesn't really matter. But, for a broad change, it will matter what the shape of the curve is. Good point. Other questions?

[[Elasticity and Medical Care]]
OK. Let me then turn to another problem we face in empirical economics. So this is an example of a problem we're facing in empirical economics. Let me turn to an example of another problem we face in empirical economics estimating elasticities. It is that individuals often choose the price they face.
Individuals, typically, often don't just face a price that's given to them. And then you can say, OK, they're given a price, and we see how they respond. They often choose the price they face.


Let me explain what I mean by that. A classic example of an elasticity that matters a lot for policies is the elasticity of demand for medical care, the elasticity of demand for medical care. That is how much less medical care will you use if you have to pay for it?


So, for example, most of us have insurance through MIT or maybe through our parents. And the way health insurance works is you pay a certain amount per month or your parents do, and, in return, that health insurance covers the cost of your medical care, most of it. But, typically, you have to pay some of it.


So how many people have gone to the doctor in the last six months? Did you have to pay something? How much did you pay? Did you pay a copayment? No? None of you? Yeah. How much did you pay?


AUDIENCE: I think like $20.



PROFESSOR: $20, $10, $5, that's what's called the copayment, or $0. Most insurance these days has what's called copayments. A copayment is what you pay when you go to the doctor. Insurance picks up the rest. You don't know. You didn't know how much the whole doctor visit cost. You just went, you gave them your card. They said your copayment is $20. You gave them $20. You don't know. The visit might have cost $100, $200, $500, $1,000. You don't know. Your insurer picks up the rest. You pay the copayment.


Copayments are rapidly on the rise in health insurance. There's a rapid rise in copayments. Increasingly, insurers are saying, look, health care costs are out of control. One way we're going to combat them is by making people bear more of the cost that they use.


I could go on forever about how I'm a health care economist. I could go on about health care forever. But just to fix ideas on why this is an issue, in 1950, the US economy spent 5% of our gross domestic product, 5% of our size of the economy went to health care. Today it's 17%. By 2075, it's projected to be 40%. That is of every dollar that's made in America, $0.40 will go to medical care. By 100 years later, it's about 100%. Literally, if we do nothing, the entire economy will be health care.


Obviously, that can't happen. We've got to deal with this. And one way that insurers and some policy makers are saying we need to deal with this is we need to make consumers bear more of the costs of their medical care. We need to make consumers pay more when they go to the doctor, so that they understand the consequences of their decision.


Well, if we're going to do that, a key question we need to know is well, does it affect their behavior? If we make consumers pay more, and it doesn't at all affect their demand for medical care-- it's just a tax on them, essentially-- then that's different than if it causes them to use less medical care. It may be good, may be bad. We'll come back to that.


But the key empirical question is what is the elasticity of demand for medical care? If you pay $20 and you pay $0, how much less like are you to use the doctor when you pay $20 versus when you pay $0. Well, we can all introspect this and think about it. But, in fact, to answer this we have to go to the data and ask, well, what's the difference?


So people, for many years, went to the data. And they said, look, there's all sorts of differences out there across people and what they pay for their copayments. Some people have insurance where they pay nothing, some where they have $20. Some people have what they call high-deductible plans. A deductible plan is where you pay the full cost of your visits until you reach some limit. So a $2000 deductible plan will be one where you pay all of your medical costs until you've spent $2,000. It's a big copayment.
So we look across those people, and people did. And they found, look, the people that have plans where they spend more for health care, where they have a high copayment, use a lot less health care than where they don't have to spend anything. The elasticity of demand looks very, very high. What is wrong with those studies? What is wrong with the conclusion those people drew? They drew it by comparing people who had plans where they paid a lot to go to the doctor, and therefore use a lot less care to people who didn't pay anything when they went to the doctor and used a lot more care. I pick the $20 person, because I picked on you already.


AUDIENCE: Probably they chose to have a high-deductible plan, because they don't often go to the doctor already.


PROFESSOR: The rational choice, if you're young and healthy, for almost everyone in this room, is going to be a very high-deductible, high copayment plan. Because it will cost you less money, because the insurer is shifting the money to you. But you don't use the doctor anyway. So who cares?


So the healthier people are going to choose the plans where they pay more. So, of course, you're going to find in the plans where people pay more they use less medical care. But is it because they're paying more, or is it because healthy guys choose those plans? It's causation versus correlation. We don't know.


Well, how can we figure that out? Well, if we were doctors, what we'd do-- real doctors, not a doctor like me, a real doctor, a medical doctor-- what we'd do is we'd run a randomized trial. So if doctors want to figure out whether a drug works or not, they don't just look at guys who take the drug versus guys who don't. They run a randomized trial. They randomly assign some people to take the drug and some people not.


Now, when you run a randomized trial, by definition, you get a causal effect. Well, this room isn't quite big enough. We all know the law of large numbers. But imagine there were four times as many people in this room or five times as many people in this room. OK? And I had you come up to the front. I flipped a coin and said half of you are going to take the drug, and half of you are not, randomly by the flip of a coin.


Then, by definition, any statistically noticeable differences I get between the group the takes the drug and the group that doesn't is caused by the drug. And how do I know that? Because I know the groups
are otherwise identical by the law of large numbers. By the law of large numbers, I know that as long as I have enough people, they're identical.


So if the only difference between them is that one's taking the drug and one's not, that's a randomized trial. That would be how I could solve the causation versus correlation problem. In medicine, thousands of randomized trials every day are being run. In fact, the FDA, before it will approve a drug, will typically require a randomized trial.


Well, in the social sciences, it's harder to run randomized trials. Because we're actually trying to understand things like people's demand for medical care, not whether a drug works or not. But, in fact, one of the most famous social randomized trials in history was called the RAND Health Insurance Experiment run in the 1970s. This is where some innovative health economists who understood this problem that we laid out about the fact that you can't just compare more or less generous health insurance policies, actually randomized health insurance policies across people.


They recruited volunteers, and they literally said, we're going to randomize. Some people are going to have policies where the health care is free, and some people are going to have policies where they have to pay, essentially, all the costs of health care.


So they, essentially, randomized across these different groups. And, therefore, they can assess what the price elasticity was. Because they knew the price difference between groups. For one, the price was zero. For one, the price was one. They actually had a range of prices they varied it across.


They could look at the quantity response, and they knew that was a quantity response to the price, because people weren't choosing their prices. The prices were being assigned to them. What did they find? Well, they found that medical demand is elastic, although not as elastic as the previous study. It's somewhat elastic. It's not as elastic as the previous studies found. They found that the elasticity of demand for medical care is around minus 0.2. So when the price goes up, people use less medical care but not that much less.


Now, let's be clear. Remember what elasticity is. That delta Q over Q. The same study showed that if you take someone who paid nothing and make them pay almost everything, their utilization of medical care falls by 45%. That's consistent with that small elasticity. Because that's a huge delta P, percent delta P. So, basically, that's comes to the question about local versus global elasticities.


So it's not saying that prices don't matter. But it's not a very, very elastically demanded good. So that's how they measure that price of elasticity of demand. That experiment, which was run over 35 years ago now, that result drives much of what we do in health policy.


So a lot of the estimates that we saw for the recently passed health reform bill derived from how do we get that estimate. We'll have to figure out how people are going to respond with their medical care when we give them health insurance. The recently passed health care bill just gave 32 million people health insurance.


Well, how are they going to respond to having health insurance? We go back to the RAND estimates and say, well, we have this elasticity of demand. We know what we're doing to the price. We figure out how much medical care is going to go up.

[[Introduction to Capital Markets]]
PROFESSOR: Our topics part of the course by revisiting another important topic that-- one of the most important topics in economics which is where does capital come from. This is a topic that is essential in economics. It's also really central, the basis, for what is in finance. So a lot of what we'll do today is really-- if you want to learn more about it you take more in economics but also more courses in Course
15.




So, basically, we spent a lot of time this semester talking about one input to the production function which is labor. We talked about labor supply, labor demand, monopsony models, et cetera. We haven't talked much about the other input into the production function which is capital. Now, partly, that's because that's a more awkward concept. It's clear what labor is. Labor is the workers working in the production process.




Capital's a little bit harder because capital's sort of everything else-- the machine, the land, the buildings, other physical inputs. And we know where labor comes from. Labor comes from our working. But it's less clear where capital comes from in some aggregate concept. So, basically, the key thing is that all forms of capital have a common feature. All forms of capital have a common feature which is what capital represents is a diversion of current consumption towards future production and consumption. So capital's about diverting current consumption towards future production and consumption.




So the original concept of capital came from farming where the notion was that farmers every year would take some of their grain, and, rather than eating it, they'd put it aside to become seed to plant for the next year. That was their capital. And so they diverted their consumption this year which was eating the grain they grew to produce future consumption through planting those seeds and creating consumption for next year.

So, basically, in a modern economy the idea is the same. And so when we think about capital, what I want you to think about is I want you to think about, basically, the capital as money. Think of the capital in the production function as the money that we invest in all these other things that aren't labor-- that we invest in machines, and we invest in buildings, and we invest in land. So we want to think about capital not as physical capital but as financial capital. That's the way to be thinking about that one aggregate letter k is this financial capital. It's the money that's invested in producing goods, in building machines, and building buildings, and stuff like that. OK?




Now, basically, where do firms get that money? So you're a firm. You want to build a building or new machine or something like that. Where do firms get that money? They get that money in capital markets. Capital markets are basically pools of money that firms draw on to invest and create capital. So a capital market-- literally think of it as a pool of money that's out there that firms can tap into if they want to build a building or build a machine or buy some land. They tap into capital markets to make those investments.




So while capital physically represents lots of different things, financially it represents one thing which is the pool of money that firms tap into to invest, to divert current consumption to future consumption. OK? It's the pool of money firms tap into to invest. That's what we mean by capital. By capital market we represent that pool of money. So think of capital as financial capital, and think of where you get financial capital in a capital market as being that pool of money that firms tap into to make investments to divert towards the future.




Now, where does that supply of money come from? Where does that supply of money come from? Well it comes from households' decisions on how much to save. OK? So the pool of money in capital markets, the pool of money that firms draw on to build capital, comes from households' decisions on how much to save.




So now we see the tie to labor, the other input in the production function. Just as households' decisions on how hard to work determines the labor input into the production function, households' decisions on how much to save determines the capital input into the production function. So just as my decision how much to work determines how much labor is available to firms, my decision on how much to save that's what fills up this pool. OK? So this pool of financial capital is filled up by household savings and then drawn down by firms' demand for investment. And that's the way a capital market works.

So, basically, if we think about capital market equilibrium-- if you go to Figure 21-1-- we have equilibrium in capital markets. Now this is just like we talked about-- this is the other factor markets. Just like we talked about labor markets and determining what determines the wage rate and the optimum amount of labor hired, it's same with capital markets. You have some demand for capital. That comes from firms' demand for investment. Firms want new machines. They want new buildings. That's downward sloping because, initially, there's very high demand for capital. But there's a marginal diminishing product. The more capital I have the less valuable it is on the margin, the less you are willing to pay for it. So there's a downward sloping demand curve for capital and an upward sloping supply curve.




And the price, in this market, is the interest rate. What is the interest rate? The interest rate is the rate you have to pay households to get them to lend you money. So the interest rate, i, is the rate you have to pay households to get them to lend you money. So if that interest rate is very high, firms will not demand much investment because they'll have to pay a lot of money to get the financial capital to finance that investment. But households will be delighted to supply lots of savings because they're getting paid a high price for it.




So, basically, the interest rate serves as the equilibrating price in this market. Just as the wage serves as the equilibrating price in the labor market, the interest rate serves as the equilibrating price in the capital market. As the interest rate rises, folks want to save more, filling more money into that pool of capital. And firms want to borrow less, taking less money out of that pool of capital. And when that supply and demand is equilibrated, at point e, is going to be where the firm's drawing on the pool at exactly the rate people are putting money into the pool. And that's going to be the equilibrium.



[[Intertemporal Choice]]
OK, so we want to focus on-- for today's lecture and next lecture as well-- is what determines the money that  goes into that pool. We know what determines the rate at which firms want to draw out of that pool. That's basically going to be determined by the production function and all the stuff we learned in lectures on production theory. You can get your optimal demand for capital. It's going to be determined by isocosts and isoquants. And you get some k star.




But what's going to determine what goes into that pool? That's going to be households' decisions to save. And households' decisions to save, we say, are determined by a process we call intertemporal choice. Added some extra letters there-- intertemporal choice. Intertemporal choice-- which is basically, instead of thinking about someone choosing between apples and bananas, we think of them choosing between consumption today and consumption tomorrow. So think of different periods like different

goods. And I'm choosing between consumption today and consumption tomorrow. That's my intertemporal choice-- the rate at which I choose to trade off consumption in different periods.




So for example, I'll illustrate how this works. Let's say that I'm deciding whether to just tell MIT, "Look, I don't want to work next year. I want to stay home and take care of my kids. You're not going to pay me. I'm taking an unpaid leave for a year." Something professors can do with enough advance warning to their chairman and such. So I'm going to take an unpaid leave next year. I'm thinking about doing that.




And now I have to say, OK, fine. Next year I'm going to take this unpaid leave so I have to decide how to allocate my-- and then I'm going to come back and life will be the same thereafter. So it's just about next year I'm going to take this unpaid leave. I have to decide how to allocate my consumption across this year while I'm working and next year while I'm taking an unpaid leave.




And let's say my salary is $80,000 a year. So one thing I could do is I can consume all $80,000 this year and consume nothing next year. That would not be a very satisfactory outcome as I die. That's obviously not going to be a satisfactory outcome. But what's the alternative? MIT's paying me this year, and they're not paying me next year. What's the alternative? Well, the alternative is I can save. And by saving, what we mean is I can loan some of the money that I make out to firms to invest in their physical capital in return for which they'll give me interest. And next year I can live on the interest I've earned from making that loan.




Now, I don't literally go to Genzyme and Microsoft and Apple and say I want to loan you money and negotiate with them. That obviously would be impossible. What I do is I implicitly loan to firms through drawing on various aspects of the capital market. So does anyone know, how can I implicitly loan to a firm? Let's say I want to-- Yeah?




AUDIENCE: Banks.




PROFESSOR: Banks. So explain what you mean.




AUDIENCE: You deposit money in a savings account for the bank. The bank pays you some interest rate so that it can use your money to loan to bigger companies that want to take money out of the bank. And

they, in return, get money from the other companies by the companies paying some interest on what they took out.




PROFESSOR: Exactly. We call banks financial intermediaries. What that means is they basically are the folks who can get a hold of firms and make those loans. So, in other words, I don't loan directly to Genzyme. I loan to the bank-- Citizens Bank, my bank, and Citizens Bank loans to Genzyme. Citizens Bank pays me an interest rate on my savings-- now close to zero, we'll come to that-- but basically pays me some interest rate. Genzyme pays them an interest rate to borrow money, higher than what they're paying me, and the difference is bank profit.




So, basically, one way I can loan money is I can put in the bank and get paid interest. we don't think about putting in the bank as a loan, but that's basically what you're doing. You're loaning it to the bank. And they're paying you interest rate, i for that loan.




What else can you do? How else can you-- Yeah? AUDIENCE: You can purchase stocks.
PROFESSOR: You could purchase stocks. So, in other words, what I could do is I could directly go to a public company, and I could take some of my $80,000 and buy stock in that company. There I'm essentially directly loaning to them. I'm directly giving them money. Now, it's not a loan that's paid back like a bank loan. It's loan that's paid back hopefully with my stock becoming more valuable or with a dividend.




So how can I loan? One is I can invest-- I could put it in the bank. The other is I can buy stock. I can put it in the bank, and the bank pays me interest. I could buy stock, and that stock pays off in two ways. One is many companies pay what we call a dividend, what is called the dividend, which is a quarterly payment that companies make to their shareholders. So if I invest in a company that pays a dividend, then I'll be getting a quarterly check from that company that's a portion of my investment.




The other is what we call a capital gain which is the stock could go up in value. So next year, if the stock goes up, if the stock market moves steadily-- it doesn't, it jumps up and down, we'll come to that-- but if it went steadily up I could just sell some of that stock next year and have extra money. So that's the other thing I could do with my $80,000. I could loan to a company by buying their stock. How else can I loan to a company? Yeah?




AUDIENCE: I don't know exactly what the difference is, but couldn't you also invest your money in a mutual fund or something?




PROFESSOR: A mutual fund-- that's a good point. That would be loaning-- a mutual fund is essentially loaning money to an aggregate collection of companies. So there are very different ways I can do stock. I can do a mutual fund, I can buy individual stocks. There's lots of different ways, but those are all different ways to buy stock. Yeah? AUDIENCE: You could buy bonds.
PROFESSOR: You could buy bonds. You could buy company bonds which is I literally loan directly to the
company. Stocks aren't really a loan. I'm literally buying an ownership share in the company, and they're paying me back. I could buy corporate bonds. I could buy corporate bonds, and the way those work is
it's literally cutting out the middleman. I don't loan to Citizens Bank, and they loan to the company. I just loan to the company, and they pay me back. That's a corporate bond.




I can also buy, by the way, I can also buy a government bond. You may know the government's running more than a trillion dollar deficit right now. Somebody's got to finance that. So you can loan to the government and get paid back by the government. OK, let's put the government aside for a minute. Let's focus where we just-- we haven't really had a government sector in our models. We're where it's just you and the companies.




So let's leave the government channel aside. But the other thing I can do with my money is I can loan it through bonds. The point is that $80,000-- yeah, I'm sorry.




AUDIENCE: With stocks, if I were to buy a stock from a company, wouldn't it be primarily and usually through the secondary market? I wouldn't be giving any money to the company. I'd just be giving money to the previous stockholder.

PROFESSOR: That's true. It basically depends on whether the marginal stock comes from a new issuance as stock by the company or through stock that's already floating around the secondary market. That's a good point. So in some sense the-- likewise with bonds. A lot of bonds are traded in a secondary market. So I'm thinking about a simple model where basically new stock gets issued by the company, I buy it. More technically you're right. It's just trading among people, but that sort of makes things complicated. Let's put that aside for now.




So, basically, the point is is my $80,000-- there's lots of things I can do with it. All of them yield me some rate-- the key point is all of them have the feature that I'm diverting today's consumption for
tomorrow's consumption. I'm taking some of my money and, rather than eating it this year when I'm working, I'm loaning it out in some way, shape, or form and getting payback in next year when I'm not working.




And we can summarize. Now this is a very complicated set of mechanisms, not to mention the secondary market issues. And this is basically a semester of 15.401. This is basically a semester of finance theory.




But basically what we're going to do is compress this all down and say that I get some interest rate on my money. However I do it, let's just say that somehow I divert my money through one of these mechanisms, and it yields some effective interest rate, i. And you can know behind that there's lots of ways I can get that interest. But for now just simplify it down and say the main thing is I'm diverting my consumption now, and it's yielding some interest earnings on that diverted consumption, i.




So what that means is that for every dollar I divert, I get 1 plus i dollars the next year. So for every dollar of consumption I divert, in one of these forms, I get 1 plus i dollars next year. So, basically, I could literally-- if I wanted to-- let's say the interest rate was 10%, just for example. Now what that means is instead of consuming $80,000 this year and nothing next year, I could consume nothing this year and
$88,000 next year. Obviously, that's not very satisfactory either.




So how do we think about that? We think about that in Figure 21-2 shows-- now this is a complicated diagram we gotta use to figure 21-2-- this shows the intertemporal choice model, intertemporal substitution we also call it. So the deal is that now instead of the x-axis being pizza and the y-axis being movies or all the other wacky things we've done, now the x-axis is first period consumption. The y-axis is second period consumption. You might say what's a period? Well a period's whatever I want it to be-- a day, a year, 10 years, whatever. Sometimes I'll say a year. Sometimes I'll say a period, but the point is it doesn't matter. It's about the trade-off.




So in my example, c1 is consumption this year. c2's consumption next year. And my trade-off is I can consume $80,000 this year, or, given the interest rate, I can consume $88,000 next year. Now the trade- off-- that's a typo, by the way. That should be minus 1.1. OK? This is a 10% interest rate. The key point is the trade-off is that, basically, I can trade off for every dollar I don't consume this year, I consume 1 plus
i-- 1 plus r there, should be 1 plus i dollars-- next year. We use r and i interchangeably for the interest
rate, so 1 plus i, 1 plus r dollars next year.




So, basically, what does the interest rate represent? This is important. The wage rate I defined as the price of leisure. Remember what the wage rate was? It was the price of leisure, that basically by working I forgoed the ability to-- I'm sorry, by taking leisure I forgoed the ability to earn a wage, w. So, literally, that was a price of sitting around on the couch was the wage, w, I could've earned. Likewise, the interest rate is the price of first period consumption. By consuming today, I'm forgoing the fact that I could've earned the interest on that money had I consumed it tomorrow or next year. So the interest rate is the price of first period consumption, just as the wage is the price of leisure. Yeah?




AUDIENCE: You said before that r and i are used interchangeably for interest. Does that play into the cost function at all? Is the cost for capital going to be the interest rate?




PROFESSOR: I'm going to come to that. That's exactly what I'll talk about next lecture.




So, basically, this is the key thing, but the key thing to understand intertemporal choice-- and the other important point to understand on why it's a bit harder than labor is there's an extra-- well it's not
harder. It's the same thing. Remember, we said we don't model bads in this course. We model goods. So
we're modeling your choice of how hard to work. We model the trade-off between consumption and leisure. And then we said define labor as the total amount of hours available minus leisure. Same thing here. We don't model savings. That's a bad. Now you might not think [? some of these ?] things are good, but savings really by itself is not a good.




Unless you're Scrooge McDuck-- does anyone know who Scrooge McDuck is? Wow, that hurts. OK, he was this old cartoon character when I was a kid who used to, like, fill a swimming pool with money and swim in it. Basically, unless you're like that, the savings itself does not give you utility. We don't have

savings entering utility functions. We have consumption entering utility functions. Savings is a bad. Savings is the mean by which you translate consumption period one into consumption period two. But from the effect of today you wish you didn't have to save. You just do it because you want to make sure you eat tomorrow.




So we model the good. The good is consumption in period one, and savings is the difference between income and consumption in period one. So we don't model savings. We define savings as y minus c1. We model c1, and define savings as y minus c1. You can see that there in the diagram.



[[Intertemporal Choice: Change in Interest Rate]]
Now what happens when the interest rate changes? Let's go to Figure 21-3. What happens when the interest rate changes? Actually, go to 21-4. OK? Skip 21-3. Got to 21-4. What happens when the interest rate changes? So, initially, we're at a point like a and then the interest rate goes up from r to r2. The interest rate goes up.




Now what does that do? Well, graphically, it steepens the budget constraint. What that means is it's raised the opportunity cost of first period consumption. First period consumption is now effectively more expensive because I'm forgoing a better savings rate by eating today. The more of my $80,000 I consume today, the less I get to save for tomorrow. And that's now a better deal to save for tomorrow because I'm getting a higher interest rate on that.




So what does that do? Well that has two effects. Just like a change in the wage rate has two effects-- a substitution effect and an income effect. The substitution effect, which we can unambiguously sign, is the fact that now first period consumption's gotten more expensive, so we do less of it. Substitution effects are always price goes up, you do less of the activity. The substitution effect is first period consumption's gotten more expensive, there'll be less of it.




Now here, once again, don't slip into thinking about savings yet. You'll really get yourself in trouble, and it's a natural tendency. Model consumption that makes savings a residual. So the activity we're modeling here is first period consumption. The price of first period consumption's gone up, so you do less of it. That's the substitution effect.




The income effect is you're now richer. And you might say what do you mean I'm richer? I still have the same $80,000 in income. But any given dollar of savings yields more income in the second period. So, overall, you're richer. If you take the perspective of saying I have two periods in this model-- first and

second period. Any given level of savings makes me richer in the second period. That means I'm richer. If I'm richer, I consume more of everything including first period consumption. So first period consumption goes up from the income effect.




I find this confusing. I don't know if you guys do, but once again-- run through this again. I'm richer because for any given amount of savings I now have a total larger sum of money over both periods. When I'm richer I consume more of everything. One of the things that I consume more of is first period consumption. So, actually, first period consumption goes up, and I save less. It's sort of bizarre. Because I'm getting more return to my savings I save less.




Here is the way I like to think of the intuition to make it easier. The way I like to think of the intuition is imagine that you have a goal for saving-- something I call a target savings level. Imagine you said, look. Imagine you said that I really want to make sure that I have certain level of savings to live on next year. Well if the interest rate goes up, I can save less to get to that target. Right? If I have a target, c2, and the interest rate is higher I can consume more c1 and still hit my target of c2. So that's the income effect. I can effectively consume more c1 because I'm made richer because any given level of savings allows me to consume more the next period. Now the target's an extreme case, but I find it a useful intuition for thinking about what's going on. And that's the income effect.




Now, obviously, as with anything, this is ambiguous. If you go to Figure 21-3 now here's a case where the income effect dominates.




Well, actually, go back to 21-4. Let's finish this example. So here with the substitution effect dominating, when the interest rate goes up I consume less in period one which means I save more. And that was prior intuition. A higher interest rate means you save more. But we'll work through the mechanics of how we get there.




And the reason the mechanics is important is because of Figure 21-3. Which as in 21-3, the interest rate goes up, but I save less. The interest rate goes up, but I consume more in period one and therefore save less. And that's consistent with this target notion. That basically I'm so-- All I care about-- let's say in the limit if all I care about in the  limit  is exactly what I consume the second period, then, basically, my period one's consumption will definitely go up from a raise in the interest rate because, basically, I'm saying, look, all I care about is what I get in the second period. Now I can save less and get to that target. So my consumption first period goes up. The income effect dominates.



So the bottom line is, just like with labor supply, we can't tell. Unlike with goods where it's rare to see a Giffen good, here we honestly don't know whether a raise in the interest rates will raise savings or lower savings. It all depends on the strength of the substitution and income effects.




Let me actually say one of the most disturbing things in empirical economics is we actually do have no idea. Literally, there's no convincing study out there which even tells us which way the effect of interest rates goes on savings. We think probably the substitution effect dominates, but it's been very hard to find a convincing estimate of that. So it's a little bit disturbing for empirical economics. We'll typically assume it dominates, but don't necessarily assume that in the real world.




OK, questions about that-- intertemporal choice framework?



[[Calculating Present Value]]
OK, now, with that in mind, let's now talk about how capital markets work. How do capital markets work? And the key concept for thinking about capital markets is the concept of present value. And the concept of the present value is simple. It's that $1 tomorrow is worth less than $1 today. $1 tomorrow is worth less than $1 today. And why is that? It's because if I had the dollar today, I could've invested it in something productive and had 1 plus i dollars tomorrow. So if you give me a dollar today I could have 1 plus i dollars tomorrow. If you give it to me tomorrow, I just have $1. So by definition, $1 today is worth more because I have the opportunity to save it. Whereas a $1 tomorrow I don't have the opportunity to save it. It's too late.




So the key point is you can't add up dollars that you receive in different periods. So, in other words, if I said to you-- if this intertemporal choice graph was back pizzas and movies, and I said you have nine pizza plus movies. You have a total of nine. You'd be like, what the hell does that mean? It matters if it's nine pizzas and zero movies or five movies and four pizzas? I don't know what that means. Those are different things. You can't add them up. You can't just say I have nine.




Well consumption over time-- it's the same thing. You can't just add up your consumption tomorrow and consumption today or a dollar tomorrow and a dollar today. They're different things. And so you have to account for the fact that $1 tomorrow is worth less than $1 today in trying to add them up.

And the way we do that is we actually do it through the concept of present value. And the idea of present value is to translate all future dollars into today's dollars. Translate all future dollars into today's dollars recognizing the fact they're less valuable in the future. So the concept of present value is the concept of any future payment's value from the perspective of today. And you should know that any future payment will be worth less than a payment today. How much less-- that's what present value tells you. How much is a future payment worth in today's terms?




So suppose that the interest rate is 10%. Suppose the interest rate is 10%, and you want to have $100 next year. So you know next year there's something you want to buy, and you have to decide how much do I have to save today to have $100 in period two. How much do I have to save today to have $100 in period two?




Well if you put in an amount, PV, into the bank-- you put PV into the bank, then you know next year you're going to have-- if you put in PV in period one, next year you're going to have PV times 1 plus i. You're going to have your PV plus all the interest you earned on it, or in our example, PV times 1.1. So what that says is that, basically, you have to put in 100 over 1.1 into the bank today, or 90.9 dollars, $90.90. If you put $90.90 in the bank today, you will have $100 tomorrow or $100 next year-- whenever the periodicity of the interest rate.




So, basically, more generally, the present value of any stream of payments is equal to that stream's future value-- I'm going to write it over here. It's bigger. The present value of any stream of payments is that stream's future value over 1 plus the interest rate to the t, where t is the year in which you get the money. So any future money you get in year t is worth that amount you get over 1 plus the interest rate to the t.




So, basically, the point is you have to weigt. Any money you're going to get, you to weight by how far into the future it is, just like if you're adding up these different goods. So, essentially, this is kind of like saying let's add a converter machine which can convert pizza into movies. Then I could say well I'll just take pizza, put it through the converter machine, and that'll tell me how many movies I have. That's what a utility function basically does. This we're saying the interest rate is the converter function. This present value formula is the converter function by which we convert two goods that are different into the same good. You convert them through this formula.




So, basically, suppose that you say to me, "Look, loan me $30, and I'll pay you back $10 a year each of the next three years." Well I should say, "Wait a second. What's the value of that to me?" Well the present value of those repayments is I'm going to have $10 in one year, so that's $10 over 1 plus i. Let's say the interest rate's 10% again. Next year I got $10. That's worth 10 over 1 plus 1. The year after, you're going to give me 10 more dollars, but that's worth 10 over 1 plus 1 squared because that's in two years. If I had that money today, I could've invested it, earned 10% and then 10% on that. And, likewise, the money you give me in the third year is worth 10 over 1.1 cubed. If you'd given me that money today, I could've invested it and and earned interest three times on it.




So the bottom line is your repayments are only worth $24.87. So I've just given you $30 today in return for a stream of payments that's only worth $24.87 today. I've lost money from that loan because I gave you the money today, and you're paying me back in the future when the money's worth less.




So, basically, the general formula we have is that the present value of any stream of future payments is that the amount of the future payment-- let's call it f for any fixed stream of future payments, $10 forever or $15 forever-- fixed stream of that amount, f, times 1 over 1 plus i, plus 1 over 1 plus i squared, plus da da da da, plus 1 over 1 plus i to the t. So if you're going to pay me a fixed amount, f, for t years, here what it's worth to me today. You pay me a fixed amount, f, for t years, it's worth this much to me today. I'm accounting for how far off in the future it is.




Now one important trick we're going to do now for the rest of the semester is we're going to take the trick of saying this is actually-- well this is a messy formula. It's actually a rather easy formula to write down if the future stream of payments is infinite, if we have what we call a perpetuity. If we have what we call a perpetuity.




A perpetuity is a future stream of payments that goes on forever or long enough that we'd consider it forever. Fifty years is probably good enough. If you have a perpetuity, then this formula can be reduced to-- the present value of any perpetuity is the amount of that perpetuity over the interest rate. It's just taking the infinite sum of that product. They're just taking the infinite sum. Those mathematically inclined will know this already. But it's just taking the infinite sum here, you can get this formula.




So any perpetuity, if you're getting a payment forever, the value of that payment today-- so if I said I'll give you $10 forever and the interest rate's going to be 10% then you'd say that's worth $100 to me. If I'm going to give you $10 forever at a 10% interest rate, then you'd say well that's worth $9.90 the next year and $8 something the next year, et cetera. And if I add all those up, I get approximately the amount of the payment over the interest rate. So, basically, that is what determines present value.


[[Calculating Future Value and Compounding]]
Now we can flip this around and we could say, OK, well, if that's present value what determines future value?




Well the future value of getting a payment today-- So that's the present value of getting payments tomorrow. The only other thing is what's the future value? What's the future value of getting a stream of payments starting today? So let's say, starting today, I'm going to get $10. I'm going to get it for a certain number of years. What's that going to be worth at the end of the day given that I can save it along the way. So, in other words, if you give me $10 today-- if you give me $10 today, well then in one year, next year, I have $11 because I got to save it at the interest rate. So if you give me $10 today, next year I'll have $11.




Now let's say that I then keep it in the bank for another year. Well the next year, it's worth 10 times 1 plus i squared, so 10 times 1.1 squared, 10 times 1.1 squared, or $12.10 and so on. So, basically, the point is that at the end of each year I earn the interest on my original $10, plus I earn the interest on the interest I earned the previous periods.




So in the long run, at the end of t years, which of the future value, is the amount invested, f, times 1 plus i to the t. That's your future value. So if you invest a given amount of money today for t years, you end
up with that much. If you invest a given amount, f, today you end up with that much--




And the key point, the key insight, is the miracle of compounding. The miracle of compounding is the point that you earn interest on your interest. And what this means is the earlier you save, the more you'll have later on.




So there's an example in the book which is very important. So it's actually thinking about-- let's think for a minute about retirement. You might say this is sort of crazy. Maybe not crazy for an old guy like me, but you're thinking I'm just starting on my career. Why would I think about retirement? Here's why you want to think about it.




Let's say, for example, that you plan to work full time from age 22 to age 70. You've got a great idea. Screw grad school. You're going right to work. You've got a great idea, and you know you want to retire at 70. So you plan to work full time from age 22 to age 70.



And let's say that you want to save money for your retirement because you're going to retire at 70. You're going to live forever. You're a healthy young person. You think you're going to live forever at 70. So you want to have money around when you retire. And let's say that the interest rate you can save at is 7%. So you can save money for your retirement at 7%, and that's your choice.




Now let's consider two different savings plans. Savings plan one is that I'm going to save $3,000. You're going to save $3,000 right off the bat. And for the first 15 years of your working life-- so from 22 to 37-- you're going to save $3,000. You're going to save $3,000 a year savings for 15 years, and then nothing. And then once you're 37 and you've got to start worrying about kids' college and mortgage, you're not going to save anything.




So from 22 to 37, when you're living high on the hog, you've got no obligations, you're going to save. Once you're 37, you've got a house, you've got kids, you've got things that are expensive, you're not going to save anymore. So then you go to zero. Zero savings from age 37 to age 70. That's a pretty bold plan. You're just going to save 15 years then zero savings. Well what do you get? Well after 15 years, if you use our future value formula, if you save $3,000 every year, you work out that you will have $75,387 in the bank. So it's more than 45-- is not just 3,000 times 15 because you get the compounding. It's not just 3,000 times 15. You actually get more than that because you got the compounding along the way.




Then if you just let it sit there in the bank-- you don't do anything. No more active savings. You let it sit there. Then by the time you retire, you have that $75,387 times 1.07 to the 33 because you let that money sit there for 33 years. You let that money sit there for 33 years. That works out to be $703,010. So by saving for 15 years-- all you did was save $3,000 for 15 years, a fraction of your career. And you retire with $703,000.




Now we'll contrast that with an alternative plan. My alternative plan is I'm going to save nothing for the first 15 years because I figure, like, I'm young. I'm gonna party. I'm going to use the money now. I'll save later. I'm nowhere near retirement. Then I get to 37. I say, wait a second, I'm starting to see more mortality. I better worry about retirement. Then I start to save, and I save for the next 33 years.




So the new plan is zero per year from age 22 to 37, and then $3,000 a year from 37 to 70. So it's a lot more savings. You're saving for more than twice as long, more than twice as long. What do you end up with? You end up with $356,800-- half, just slightly more than half, than what you end up with the first plan, even though you save for twice as many years.




This is like the parents' lecture why you should save. The point is that saving early lets you ride the wave of compounding for many, many years. Savings late does not let you do that. And as a result, you end up with less money.




I take my kids to the science museum, and at the science museum they have these little ramps. And you can drop a ball. And one is flat then steep, and one is steep then flat. And the one that's steep then flat always wins because there's compounding in acceleration the same way. The point is building up early and then riding that velocity going forward is a lot better than starting late. Questions about that?




So make sure when you get those jobs, and they offer you-- we'll talk next time about savings incentives-- and they offer you those good 401K packages, that you take them, and don't say I'll worry about that later.



[[Accounting for Inflation: Real Interest Rate]]
Now, one last thing. Last thing I want to cover is that we've ignored, so far, the whole concept of inflation. When I've talked about savings, I've presumed that you've saved the money and it's worth something. But who the hell knows what $703,000 will be worth in 48 years? What's that even going to be worth? How do we even think about that?




Well we have to account for the fact that stuff's going to be more expensive. So we have to account for inflation in doing this. And the way we do this is by recognizing that what we've done so far is we've talked about the nominal interest rate. By the nominal interest rate, I meant the interest rate that you actually see posted in the bank.




But what matters, ultimately for your well-being, is the real interest rate which is what your money can do in terms of actually buying goods. So I should not care about how much money I have next year. I should care about how many goods I can buy next year. The money's just paper. What matters is what I can get with it. That's what matters.




So let's say, for example, I want to use all my money on Skittles. That's just what I want to use my money on. So let's say I have $100, and I want to spend that money on Skittles. And let's say Skittles today are $1 a bag. And let's say the interest rate, once again, is 10%. And let's say there's no inflation. Inflation equals zero. So my choice is I can spend $100 on Skittles today and get 100 bags. So I could have 100 bags today. Or I can save it, have $110 tomorrow and get 110 bags of Skittles. That's my choice. That's my trade-off.




Now let's say there's inflation. Let's say that prices are rising at 10% a year, as well. So the prices are rising 10% a year, as well. What that means is next year Skittles cost $1.10 a bag. So now what's my trade-off? That means I could have 100 bags today or 100 bags tomorrow. I don't get any more Skittles tomorrow. I get 10 more dollars, but who cares? Everything costs more. If everything cost 10% more and I get a 10% interest rate, that interest rate is effectively zero in terms of what I can buy.




The real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus inflation. What I care about is what I can buy. So I have to take out of the interest rate what happens to prices. Because if prices go up, it offsets what I'm earning in the bank. And so what I care about is I care about what the bank posts minus what inflation will be. So it's even trickier, right? Because it's not about what inflation was, it's what inflation will be. You'll have to guess what inflation is going to be.




And so what we care about is this real interest rate. And that's why the interest rate that banks pay, a primary determinant of it is inflation. Right now, we are in the lowest inflation period this nation's seen since World War II. Core inflation-- we don't really get into inflation in this course-- but core inflation, which is inflation minus some things which fluctuate a lot, is basically zero in the US. So, basically, nominal interest rates are the same as real interest rates, and that's why the interest rates you see posted are so incredibly low because there's no inflation.




In the late 1970's, when inflation was running at 10-15% a year, interest rates were 15 to 20% a year. Now it wasn't that you could get so much more for your savings in the 1970's. It was just that stuff was going to cost more next year, so banks, if they wanted to induce you to save, had to pay you a higher interest rate. So, essentially, banks are going to have to pay you to get you to put your money in. If in 1978, when the inflation rate was 15%-- if banks had offered a 3% interest rate no one would've put money in the banks because you would end up losing effectively. Effectively, that's a negative 12% real interest rate.




So what matters is how much the bank pays you in cash minus how much more stuff is going to cost. And that's often what matters. Now that's a distinction we won't spent a lot of time on later on. I'll just say interest rate. I won't say real versus nominal. But you've got to know in your head that what matters is the interest rate is the real interest rate, what the bank pays you, minus how much more stuff's going to cost. Questions about that?




Alright, we'll come back next time. There is class on Wednesday. It does matter. And on Wednesday we're going to talk about the rest of capital markets and people's savings decisions.

[[Expected Utility Theory and Risk Aversion]]
PROFESSOR: Modeling decision under uncertainty turns out to be a critical part of what we do in economics. And I'll spend today's lecture talking about this set of issues.




And, let me just say, the uncertainty you face now is nothing compared to the uncertainty that you'll face later in life. So you have uncertainty now about whether you should study for the final, or carry an umbrella, or go on a date with this person. I've got uncertainty about whether I should refinance my mortgage, or which college to send my kid to, or how much life insurance I should buy. Uncertainty only get more and more important as you move on in life. This is an important issue.




Now, how do we think about uncertainty? Well, the tool that we use to think about uncertainty is, once again, to make simplifying assumptions which allow us to write down sensible models, but which
capture the key elements of what we're thinking about. And the simplifying assumption here is we move to the tools of what we call expected utility theory.




And so, basically, the way we think about expected utility theory is the following. Imagine that I offered you guys in this class a choice. And I'm just going to say right now, there's no right answer to this. But I do want you guys to answer me. There's no right answer.




Here's the question. I'm going to give you a choice. I'm going to flip a coin. I have a coin in pocket, and I'm going to flip it. And I'm going to offer you guys the ability to make a bet. If it comes up heads, you win $125. If it comes up tails, you lose $100. Heads, you win a $125. Tails, you lose $100. There's no right answer. How many would take that bet. How many people would not take that bet? Very good. That's the typical set of responses I get to this.




Now, what's interesting is to think about the parameters of that bet. And to think about it, let's take a step back to something we've discussed already this semester, the concept of expected value. What's
the expected value of that gamble? The expected value, if you remember, is the probability of each outcome times the value of that outcome. That is you remember expected value, which you defined before, is the probability that you lose times the value if you lose plus the probability that you win times the value if you win. That's the expected value of a gamble.




So, in this context, the expected value is there's a 50% probability that you lose, so 0.5. And if you lose, you lose minus $100 plus a 50% value that you win. It's flipping a coin after all. And if you win, you won
$125. So the expected value of this gamble is $12.50. On average, if I did this enough times, you would
win $12.50 per time. Statistically, if I did this enough times, you'd win $12.50 per time.




So, in other words, we say that this is more than a fair bet. A fair bet is one with an expected value of 0.
A fair bet has an expected value of 0. So a fair bet would be tails you lose $100, heads you win $100. This is a more than fair bet. There's more than 0 expected value. Yet, the majority of you would not be
willing to take this bet. In fact, the majority of people would not take this bet.




Why is that? Why is it that I've dictated a bet which has a positive expected value and yet, people won't take it. Yeah.




AUDIENCE: But wouldn't that also depend on how much money you have. PROFESSOR: It will absolutely depend on how much money you have.
AUDIENCE: Right. So if I were a richer person, then losing $100 isn't as important to me as the chance of
getting $125.




PROFESSOR: OK. So flesh that out. Why is that? Why is it that basically it would matter how much wealth you have. Because no matter how much wealth you have, this math is impeachable. It's always a good bet. So why is it that your state without much wealth, your state as college students without much wealth, what is it about you that causes you to not want to take this bet that's more than fair.
AUDIENCE: So, basically, for me, the risk of losing or the state I will be in after I lose is much greater, well, for me, a lot more than what I would be in if win.




PROFESSOR: Exactly. And there's two possible reasons for that. One we're going to push off to the very end of the lecture. The main reason we're going to focus on is because individuals do not consider expected value, they consider expected utility, and individuals are risk averse. Expected utility is going to differ from expected value when individuals are risk averse.




Expecting utility is not going to be the probability times the value if you lose. Expected utility is going to be the probability that you lose times the utility if you lose plus the probability that you win times the utility if you win. And utility is not the same as value, importantly, because utility functions exhibit diminishing marginal utility.




Utility functions are not linear. Utility functions are nonlinear. And, in particular, there's diminishing marginal utility. And with diminishing marginal utility, you're going to not want bets where there's the chance you lose is equal to or even a bit smaller than the value that you win. And the basic point is that the joy of winning is smaller than the pain of losing with diminishing marginal utility. Yeah.




AUDIENCE: Isn't there also a statistical side to this then? Because we don't know how many times we're going to bet. It might just be once. We're a lot more comfortable if, let's say, use the law of large numbers and say, OK, it's going to eventually even out so we'll win $12.50 a game. But for the first, let's say 10 or so games, we might get really unlucky and flip eight tails and two heads.




PROFESSOR: But, once again, if you weren't risk averse, you wouldn't care about that. Hold that thought. I'm going to explain why that isn't true. So just hold that thought.




So now let's imagine that your utility functions are the typical form we've worked with before, the typical diminishing marginal utility form we've worked with before where utility is the square root of consumption. You're casting your mind back to consumer theory here. You're going to have to start integrating the course now, both consumer and producer theory.




So remember we said the typical diminishing marginal utility function we worked with was u equals the square root of c. Now, let's say you start with consumption of $100. Imagine you consume your income.
Let's say you have consumption of $100. Well, then utility is 10. If you start with a consumption of $100, your utility is 10.




Now let's calculate the expected utility of this gamble. The expected utility of this gamble is that there's a 50% chance that you lose. And, if you lose, what is your utility? Well you lose $100. So consumption goes to 0. So utility is 0 plus a 50% chance that you win. Well, what do you get if you win. Well, if you win, you go from $100 to $225. So your utility is the square root of $225, or $15. Your utility is the square root of $225 or 15. It's half chance of having 15. I'm sorry. So this is a negative. Yeah. So utility, if you take this gamble, is you end up with a utility of 7.5. So utility falls. You move from a utility of 10 without the gamble to a utility of 7.5 with the gamble. Utility is lower with the gamble, which is why people decided they didn't want to take that gamble. Utility is lower.




And the reason is because given a utility function of this form, you are sadder about losing than happier about winning. To see that, we can see that graphically in Figure 20-1. This graph's utility against wealth-
- we don't usually graph utility, because it's not cardinal. Remember it's just ordinal. But the sort of gives you a sense of the intuition. This is a graph of utility against wealth levels.




So you start at point A. You start with $100 in wealth, which is consumption. and utility of 10. Now, I give you a choice of a gamble. That gamble has a 50% chance of leaving you at 0 and a 50% chance a leaving you at point B. So your utility and expected value is the midpoint of that chord that runs from 0 to B or point C. Your expecting utility is lower than your initial utility. Why? Because utility is concave. You are made so sad by getting to 0 that it vastly overcompensate the happiness you feel moving to
$225 because of the diminishing marginal utility.




Because, basically, think of it this way. Imagine it's your actual income. Let's take the point about the size of the gamble relative to income seriously. Imagine, literally, I was asking you to gamble your entire income for the year. And if you lose, you starve to death. And if you win, you get to eat extra nice. Well, clearly, the disutility of starving to death vastly outweighs the extra utility to eating well.




So, in that extreme example, if this was your entire wealth, you can see why you would have a situation where you wouldn't want to take that gamble. Because if you lost, you'd die. And, basically, risk aversion arises because, basically, with diminishing marginal utility you're made so much sadder. That steepness at the bottom, you get so much sadder as you get towards 0 that it vastly overcompensates the flatter part as you move above your initial point. So, as you can see, you are going to end up not wanting
gambles even if they're fair. Gambles that are fair, that is positive expected value, might still lead to a reduction in your expected utility.




Indeed, let me go further. You dislike this gamble so much that if I said the following, I as your teacher am going to force you to take this gamble-- imagine it's like 100 years ago where teachers can beat students and stuff-- I'm going to force you take this gamble unless you pay me, you would actually be willing to pay me to avoid taking this gamble. How much would you pay me?




Imagine utilities in dollar terms. Imagine we're actually measuring utility in dollar terms. How much would you pay me to avoid taking this gamble. If I said you either take the gamble, or you pay me. You're starting with a utility of 100. Yeah?




AUDIENCE: The difference between the two utilities.




PROFESSOR: Well, the difference between the two utilities. So utility is 100 here. Here utility is 7.5 squared, so 56.25. So you would actually pay me $43.75 to avoid taking this gamble.




Think about that. I've offered you a more than fair bet, a very good bet, which, on average, will yield you a positive $12.50. Yet you will pay me $43.75. You will pay almost half of your entire wealth to avoid taking that gamble. That's pretty incredible if you think about it. I've offered you a more than fair bet, and yet you will pay me more than half your wealth, almost half your wealth, to avoid taking that bet.




So another way to see this, let's look at this another way. How large would I have to make the positive payoff for you to take the bet? Let's look at it that way. Right now I said you win $125 with heads. How much would you have to win with heads if you were going to take that bet? Yeah. And tell us how you figured that out.




AUDIENCE: Because you need to have at least the same utility as you had before from the unexpected utility. So more than half of his per year utility would be 20 if he wins. 20 squared is 400. [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].
PROFESSOR: Right. You'd need to win 300. Because I'd need to take your utility to 20 if you win. Only then would you be willing to take this gamble.




So another way to say it is that's how fair a gamble would need to be, how more than fair it would need to be before you take it. You'd need me to pay off 3:1 on a 50% chance before you'd take the bet. And this is just with a typical looking utility function of the kind we worked earlier in the semester.




You didn't look at this earlier in the semester and say, wow, that's a bizarre utility function. We got sensible answers on our problems, and problem sets, and tests, and things, examples from square root of c. That seemed like a sensible function. And yet it yields these incredibly wild predictions that you would pay people almost half of your wealth to avoid engaging in a more than fair bet. And that you would need the odds to be like 3:1 before you even consider taking a a bet.




That's the power of uncertainty and the power of risk aversion. Really, risk aversion, it's just the power of diminishing marginal utility. The power of diminishing marginal utility is so key to driving our decisions. It's the fact that that first pizza means so much more to you than the fifth pizza, that you really hate outcomes that don't let you get the first pizza. And, as a result, you will pay a lot to be forced into a situation where you don't get any pizzas. You'll need to be paid a lot in the state where you do win to deal with the state where you don't.



[[Alternative Examples of Utility Functions]]
Questions about that? Now, we can change the example in some interesting ways to understand it. So let's change the example to say, instead, let's talk about some alternatives to this example and how they affect our intuition. First alternative, imagine your utility function instead of being square root of c, your utility function was 0.1 times c, a linear utility function, not a non-linear utility function.




We can now say that, in that case, you actually would take the gamble. There's a 0.5% chance of 0. And I chose 0.1 times c, because your initial utility is still 10 then. I normalized this. So starting with your bundle of 100 you still start at 10. It gives the same starting point as the square root function.




But now your expected utility from his gamble is 0.5 times 0 plus 0.5 times if you win 125, your utility is 12.5. I'm sorry. It's 22.5. So your expected utility is 11.25 which is higher than your starting utility. So you would take this gamble. What's changed?
AUDIENCE: No diminishing marginal utility.




PROFESSOR: No diminishing marginal utility because now we are no longer risk averse. We are what we call risk neutral. A linear utility function yields risks neutrality. And once you're risk neutral, you only care about expected value. Risk neutral consumers would only care about expected value.




And so a linear utility function will lead to risk neutrality since you don't have diminishing marginal utility. Then you take any bet that's fair. You don't care. You're indifferent between winning a dollar and losing a dollar with this utility function. It doesn't matter if you go up or down. The joy you get from winning is the same as the pain you get from losing. Whereas with this utility function, the pain you get from losing exceeds the joy from winning.




We can see that graphically in the next figure, Figure 20-2, the case of risk neutrality. Here, you start at point A. You have 100, and your utility is 10. Now, I've offered you a gamble where there's a 50% chance of getting 0 and a 50% chance of getting B. Well, that yields an outcome of c, which is a higher utility. So since your utility is linear, you're risk neutral, and you'll take any fair bet.




We can go further. What if utility, instead, was of the form u equals c squared over 1,000? What if this was your utility function? Once again, your initial utility u of 100 is 10. It's the same starting point.




But this is a utility function which now if you do this gamble, your expected utility is 50% times 0 plus 50% times $225 squared over 1,000 which is 25.3. That's a huge increase in utility from this gamble. So your expected utility with the gamble is 25.3. It's a huge increase in utility.




And that's because this is an individual where the shape of the utility function has change where they don't have diminishing marginal utility, they have increasing marginal utility. We've never worked with utility functions like this before. These are individuals we call risk-loving. That is, they are made happier by winning $1 than they are made sadder by losing $1. It's the opposite of all the intuition we developed earlier in this course. It's a crazy utility function.




But the notion of a risk-loving utility function is one where literally $1 that moves you up makes you happier than $1 that moves you down makes you sadder. You can see that in Figure 20-3. Here's a risk- loving utility function. The individual starts at point A. They have a choice of a gamble where they can have a 50% chance of landing at 0 and a 50% chance-- Jessica, that B should be down at the intersection of dashed lines-- a 50% chance of landing at B at the intersection of the dashed lines. You take the average of those two, and it's c. Their utility is way higher with the gamble than it was without the gamble.




In fact. we can go further. With a risk-loving person, they would actually take an unfair bet. Consider the following bet. Tails you lose $100, heads you win $75. That's a bet with a negative expected value. Neither the risk averse nor the risk neutral person would take that bet. But a risk-loving person would. If you work out the math, that bet gives them a gain in expected utility. That is a bet with a negative expected value that gives them a gain in expected utility.




Why is that? Because it's the opposite of diminishing marginal utility intuition. They're made so much happier by winning that they're willing to take a bet even if it's a negative expected value. Just like the risk averse person is made so much sadder by losing, they won't take a bet even if it's more than fair. So you can actually develop all the opposite predictions from a risk-loving person. They'll even take unfair gambles.




Now, by the way, I skipped over your earlier question about risk neutrality. With risk neutrality, you see it doesn't matter if you do it 100 times or one time. If you're risk neutral, you should take the bet anytime, because the expected value is still positive. Now, you're thinking about risk aversion where, in substance, you're more confident as the numbers go up. But if you're risk neutral, you'll take it no matter how many times I offer you that bet.




So to extend this further, let's go to a third extension which will develop this intuition further. Now imagine that I offer you guys a different gamble. And, once again, I really want you to answer honestly. Don't try to game me. Answer honestly. Now the gamble is if I flip a coin, tails you lose $1, heads you win $1.25. Now how many of you would take that gamble. How many would not take that gamble? OK. I hope you're answering honestly. But maybe you're just thinking ahead and realizing that that gamble is very different. And why are people more willing to take that gamble than they were willing to take the previous gamble, the same risk averse people. Yeah.




AUDIENCE: The difference in [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].
PROFESSOR: Exactly. In particular, the utility function is locally linear. Let's go back to Figure 20-1. As you get closer and closer to A, you could draw, essentially, a linear segment. So for an infinitesimal bet,
utility is linear. So it's linear at point A.




So for small bets, you become risk neutral. Even a risk averse person moves towards risk neutrality as the bet is small relative to their resources. This was the point that you were making. Basically if you're a rich person, you'd probably be happy to take the $100 and $125 thing. I'd be happy to do that. I'm a rich guy. I'd be happy to do that.




So, basically, what determines your willingness to take a bet is going to be about what's at stake relative to your resources. And what you can see is that if you solve the math here, that basically expected utility even with a square root of c is positive for that smaller gamble. Because as it gets smaller relative to the
$100 you start with, you become roughly risk neutral. And then you'll go ahead and take the gamble.




So at the end of the day what's going to determine whether you're going to take a gamble is going to be your level of risk aversion and the size of the risk you're taking relative to your resources. The more risk averse you are, and the bigger the gamble, the less likely you are to take it at a given level of fairness. Questions about that? All right.



[[Applications of Expected Utility Theory: Insurance]]
So now that we all understand expected utility theory. Now we're going to go on and talk about why this matters in the real world and how we use it. And I want to talk, in particular, about two applications, insurance and the lottery. Let's start by talking about insurance and why people have insurance.




Because, in fact, given what we learned in this lecture, there would be no reason for insurance. This lecture tells us why people have insurance. Because there's diminishing marginal utility, and you're made so much sadder with a negative outcome, you're willing to pay you avoid it.




Remember we talked about that you would be willing to pay almost $44 to avoid being forced to take that bet? That's what insurance does. Insurance allows you to avoid taking gambles. That's what you can think of insurance as. It's a way to avoid taking a gamble. You're gambling you're going to get sick.

You're gambling your house is going to burn down. These are gambles you face that are forced on you by nature. What insurance does is allow you to avoid taking those gambles. And just like you'd pay me to avoid the $100, $125 gamble, you're paying Aetna to avoid gambling that you might have to go to the hospital.


So let's say there's a 25-year-old who is deciding whether to buy health insurance. And let's say they're 25-year-old guy, totally healthy. I say guy because there's no risk they're going to have a kid. So he's basically totally healthy, basically zero chance they're going to use the doctor except if they get hit by a car.




So imagine the situation is that you've got 25-year-old with an income of $40,000. And let's say that there's a 1% chance that they'll get hit by a car. It is Cambridge after all. So every time you cross the street, there's a 1% chance you get hit by a car. And if you get hit by a car, you're going to suffer $30,000 in hospital bills.




And let's say your utility function is square root of c. So you're a risk averse guy. So let's say that I then come to you and say, look, each year there's an expected cost to you of getting hit by car of $300. How did I calculate that? Well, every year there's a 1% chance you get hit. They're independent draws, let's say. If you get hit this year, it doesn't mean suddenly you're safer. It's random. It's just crazy drivers.




So there's a 1% chance you're going to get hit every year. And if you get hit, there's a $30,000 cost. So every year there's an expected cost to you-- the opposite of expected value is expected cost-- of $300. So let's say I offered to sell you insurance for $300. I offered to sell you insurance in a way where, on average, if you lived an infinite number of years, you would pay out in premiums what you'd get in benefits. If you paid $300 a year and lived forever or lived for many, many years-- the law of large numbers enough years-- then basically you would pay out in premiums what you would collect in benefits. You'd get hit once every 100 years. And ever 100 years you would have paid $30,000 in premiums, and you'd collect $30,000 in benefits.




So that's what we call actuarially fair insurance. Actuarially fair insurance is insurance where the price of the insurance equals the probability of the bad outcome times the cost of the bad outcome. That's actuarially fair insurance where the price you pay is the probability of the bad outcome times the cost of the bad outcome. That's fair because, over a large enough population, the premiums that get paid in will get paid out in the form of claims.




Now, let's ask what is your utility if you do not or do buy insurance. So for the first thing you say if I'm a 25-year-old. Screw it. I'm never going to get hit by a car. I'm not going to buy insurance. What's your utility with no insurance? Well, if you have no insurance, there's a 1% chance, 0.01, that you'll lose $30,000. You'll get hit by a car and lose $30,000. Your income is $40,000.




So there's a 1% chance that you'll end up with a utility, which is the square root of 10,000. And there's a 99% chance you'll end up with a utility that's the square root of 40,000. You work this out, and the answer is you get 199. Utility without insurance is 199 which is pretty close to utility just if you weren't going to get hit by the car. Because it's so rare that you get hit by the car. So utility is 199 without insurance.




Now, let's ask the question, how much would you be willing to pay to have insurance? How do we figure that out? $300 is the actuarially fair premium. But now let's do a different question. I'm an insurance company, and I want to make money. I don't want to just charge the actuarially fair premium. The insurance company makes no money with this premium of $300. So the insurance company wants to make money.




How would we figure out how much would you be willing to pay, this 25-year-old, be willing to pay to get insurance? How do we figure that out? Yeah.




AUDIENCE: Maybe you could keep the utility function constant. PROFESSOR: Keep the utility value constant.
AUDIENCE: Value, yes.




PROFESSOR: Exactly. You'd have ask well, how much would I be willing to pay to have insurance which would protect me and leave me at the same utility level. Obviously it would have to be a little bit higher. But let's just set it equal.




So, in other words, if I bought insurance, my utility with insurance, there's a 1% chance that I will get hit by the car. In that case, what happens to me? Well, if I get hit by the car, I get $10,000. I make $40,000. I lose $30,000.


Let me actually write it out. If I get hit by the car, what happens to me? Well, I make $40,000. I always make $40,000 each year. I lose $30,000, because I get hit by the car. But then the insurance company pays me $30,000. They pay off my debts. So then I gain $30,000. So these things cancel. But I have to pay the insurance company premium. So I have to pay some amount x.




If I don't get hit by the car, I get my $40,000 income, but I still have to pay the insurance company premium. I have to pay them whether I get hit or not. It's insurance. I pay them either way. So that's my utility.




So my expected utility with insurance is the sum of these two. And I want to set that equal to 199. I want to say what x am I willing to pay that would leave me at the same utility as if I was uninsured as per the answer here?




Well, it turns out that if you do, that if you solve this, you get that x equals 399. That is you would pay
$399 for insurance that has a value of only $300. You'd pay $399 for insurance even though the actuarially fair price is $300. You would pay you insurance company $99 more than they expect to pay out to you. Why? Because you're risk averse. Because you're made so much sadder than being left with $10,000 than you are by having to pay $300.




If it doesn't work out, you pay $300. Who cares? That's tiny compared to your income. But if it does work out, you're safe from having to starve. You pay $400, I'm sorry. You pay $399. You're like, look, I'll be bummed if I have to pay $400. That's a percent of my income basically. That would be a shame to pay a percent of my income for something that doesn't happen. But, boy, would I be happy in that 1 in 100 chance where I get hit by a car when I'm not out $30,000.




So you will pay $399 for insurance that's only worth $300. That extra $99 we call a risk premium. We call that a risk premium. The extra $99, we call a risk premium. That is the amount that you are willing to pay above and beyond the fair price, because you're risk averse.




And what you should go home and show yourself using the same kind of mathematics is that, for example, the risk premium will rise the bigger the loss is. Hopefully you can see the intuition on that. The bigger the loss is for a given level of income the bigger the risk is. Likewise, for a given loss, the risk premium falls with income. So the bigger is the loss of relative to income the more risk premium you're willing to pay.




You should also, obviously, see that the more risk averse you are, the bigger premium you're willing to pay. A risk neutral person would not pay a risk premium. Only a risk averse person will. So the more risk averse you are, the bigger risk premium you'll pay, and the bigger the loss is relative to your income. These are the same principles we talked about before.




So the $43.75 we were willing to pay to avoid that gamble I was going to force on you, that was the risk premium. You were willing to pay $44 to avoid that gamble. Here, you're willing to pay $99 to avoid the risk of ending up in that bad state where you get hit by the car. And that's why people buy insurance. And that's why insurance companies make ungodly amounts of money.




In the US we have a health insurance industry, for example, that earns about $800 billion a year. Why do they make all that money? Because people are risk averse, and they're willing to pay to have someone else bear the risk of their injury or illness. Any questions about that?




Now, I don't mean by that to say, insurance is a bad thing, and we shouldn't do it. Risk aversion is the nature of our utility functions. We should be willing to pay a risk premium. It's just that you need to understand why, in fact, it makes sense to have insurance in that case.



[[Applications of Expected Utility Theory: The Lottery]]
The second application is the lottery. The lottery is a total ripoff. I hope you knew this already. The expected value of $1 lottery ticket is roughly $0.50. So for every $1 you spend in the lottery, in expectation, you get about $0.50 back. This is an incredibly bad bet, incredibly unfair, an incredibly unfair bet. On average, you lose $0.50 for every $1 you bet.




So, basically, despite that, lotteries are wildly popular. They've become a huge source of revenue for state governments. A lot of the money that state governments now take in is through state lotteries.




What accounts for the fact that lotteries are so popular? Well, there's four different theories for why lotteries are so popular. The first is that people are risk-loving. We have it all wrong. Actually people like taking risks, and the lottery feeds that.


This, of course, we can immediately rule out. How? How do we know this is wrong? That the answer is that people play the lottery because they're risk-loving. How do we know people aren't risk-loving?




AUDIENCE: The same people don't take [UNINTELLIGIBLE]




PROFESSOR: And they spend $800 billion a year on health insurance. Basically, as a society, we spend, in total, about $1.5 trillion a year on insuring various risks that face us. We're not risk-loving. So that's clearly not the answer.




However, there's an alternative. People could basically alternate between risk-loving and risk-aversion. This is a theory due to Milton Friedman, the famous economist from Chicago and a co-author named Savage, the Friedman-Savage preferences, where the notion is that basically people are risk averse over small gambles but risk-loving over large gambles.




So to see that, go last figure in the graph. This is sort of a complicated case. Basically, the notion is if you take someone, they have a utility function which is initially risk averse and then becomes risk-loving. That is in the segment between W1 and W3, that looks like a risk averse utility function. But once you get above W3, it looks like a risk-loving utility function.




So the notion is that for things which can make me very poor, I'm risk averse. I want to insure against events which will leave me in that bottom segment. But once I'm going to be above W3, then great. I'm happy to take risks. Then I become risk-loving.




Now, this is a not crazy idea. Graphically, what I'm showing you here, is that b* is utility without the gamble and b is with. So you see you're happier without the gamble when your income is low. Once your income is a lot higher, you're happier with the gamble at d then you are without the gamble at d*.




That's not a crazy theory. The notion is that once I'm rich enough, I become risk-loving. But when I'm poor, I don't want to take the risks. The problem is that this is inconsistent with lottery behavior in the following sense.


Most people who play the lottery don't play the Mega Millions. They play tiny scratch lotteries where you bet $1 to win $10. And people spend huge amounts of money on lotteries with very, very low payoffs. That is inconsistent with this. Because this would say that you'd only play lotteries that have big payoffs.




Lotteries that have small payoffs, once again, there's no reason to play that and still buy insurance. So if you're buying insurance against being low income, why are you playing these small lotteries that are a ripoff. Because those small ones are a ripoff too. So the existence of the fact that the most popular lotteries are actually the small lotteries is inconsistent with this explanation. Yeah.




AUDIENCE: So I'm confused. Is it risk-loving on large gambles?




PROFESSOR: Yeah, risk-loving on large gambles. It's not the size of the gamble. You're risk-loving on gambles which leave you in a high wealth state. The point is that if I'm gambling over winning Mega Millions. Yeah, I'm a little risk averse. But the truth is winning Mega Millions would make me so happy that I could move into the risk-loving part of my utility function. But this would not explain why people ever play something that pays off $100.




This is a fancy way of the intuition you probably have. It's I'd think differently about something which would completely change my life and make me a multi-billionaire, that's something that would make me raise me, than the bet I offered you guys before. People are systematically taking terrible bets like the kind i offered you guys before. And that's inconsistent with these preferences.




The third explanation is entertainment. It's that the utility function has in it the thrill of the risk. We only write down utility functions that are a function of consumption like how many pizza and movies you see. But people have utility over lots of things. One thing you may have utility of the thrill of being able to scratch the thing off and seeing if they won or not.




That would actually be consistent with the fact that people play a lot of small lotteries. If it's a thrill of winning that matters, if it's the scratch off thrill that matters, then the optimal thing to do, in fact, would be to not play one Mega Million. It would be to play lots of little lotteries. And that would be consistent with that behavior.


So one story that is consistent with what we see is that people actually view this as entertainment. On the other hand, once again, it's really expensive entertainment. Because you're throwing away $0.50 of every $1. So you've got to get a lot of enjoyment out of that scratch off relative to when you go to see a movie. So that's another theory.




I'm going to put this in here. It sort of inserts in here. We talked about the fact that people can't be risk- loving because they buy insurance. And this alternating thing doesn't work, because they play small lotteries. But another theory that might fit here is a theory we call loss aversion. This is sort of a
different version of the Friedman-Savage preferences. It's that people are, in general, risk averse. But, in fact, they're really risk averse on the downside, and they don't care so much on the upside.




So, in other words, the point is that when I initially offered you that bet of win $125, lose $100, part of your reaction was about the risk aversion. But a lot of you are thinking, I'd be really bummed if I lost
$100. It's not just that I don't have it to spare. It's just like, god, I would kick myself. It was one flip of the
coin. How could I possibly have been so stupid? Whereas if you won, you'd be happy. But then you'd go on to the next class.




The notion is that basically it's an extreme version of risk aversion. It's not only that you're risk averse, it go further than that. Relative to the starting point, anything which is a loss really pisses you off. So, in fact, even that little gamble I offered you, win $1.25 lose $1, you still might not take. Some of you still wouldn't take it. And the reason you wouldn't take it can't be risk aversion. Because it's just too small for risk aversion to plausibly work. It's that you'll just be bummed that you did that and you took that chance. You'd be made sadder by the loss than you'd be made happier by the win.




In that case, that could explain why people spend a lot of money to buy insurance. Because they'll be so bummed if things go badly. But they might play the lottery because, in fact, around that point, they don't view the money they're spending as a loss. They think of it differently. They think of the loss of being my house burned down. That's a loss. That would make me really sad. But the $1 I paid to pay the lottery, that's not really a loss.




So I'm risk neutral going up and really risk averse going down. So I'm willing to take gambles that push me up. It's sort of like Friedman-Savage. I'm willling to take gambles that push me up, not gambles that pull me down.


But, once again, that doesn't really explain the small ones. That doesn't really explain the small ones. That's more the entertainment theory.




Then finally, the last theory we have is that people are stupid. The lottery is, after all, its official motto is a tax on the stupid. And that's what it is. It's a tax on the stupid. Basically many of your public schools are financed by taxes paid by stupid people. It's sort of ironic.




But people just don't know. You probably all had a vague sense that the lottery wasn't a sensible thing to play. But how many people actually knew it was that bad a deal as I said. That is actually was $0.50 expected payoff. A few of you knew. But most of you knewm had a vague sense it was a bad deal. You didn't know how bad a deal it was. This is sort of hard to figure out. Meanwhile, you see on TV that these guys win these bazillion dollars, and you get the thrill of scratching if off.




So, basically, if people are just stupid, then that could explain it. The problem is it matters a lot for government policy which of these is right. Because if A through C is right, if one through three are right, then the government should go ahead and allow lotteries. And there's no reason why the state shouldn't run a lottery.




In fact, let's take the entertainment theory. If this is really entertainment, and the state can make money off of my entertainment, then that's a win-win. I'm happy, because I'm playing the lottery. The state is happy, because it's financing schools. That's a win-win. So if these are right, you're going to want to encourage state lotteries.




But if this one's right, we don't want to have them. Because, A terrible way to raise government revenues is to tax stupid people. There are much better ways to raise government revenues. We'll talk about taxation in a couple of lectures. But, clearly, taxing the stupid is not going to be an optimal tax. Yeah.




AUDIENCE: I can maybe sort of understand why people would prefer smaller lotteries over bigger lotteries. Because they are thinking that in smaller lotteries, they have a much bigger chance of winning than in bigger lotteries. So, in that sense, their expected payoff in terms of utility or other [INAUDIBLE PHRASE] is a lot higher than the antes in the bigger ones, even though the bigger ones might end up being a lot heavier--




PROFESSOR: So that's sort of an entertainment theory, which is my utility derives from the win. You have a theory in mind my utility derives from the win. Because if it's just about dollars, that wouldn't explain it. Because I win so many more from the big one that it would compensate from the frequency at which I'd win the little one.




But if I actually, in my utility function, have the joy of seeing that winning thing, then that would explain it. That's an entertainment theory. You're saying, in my utility function, I actually get joy from scratching off and seeing that it's a winner, and so much joy that I'd much rather take a 10% chance at a small win than a 1% chance at a huge win. Because then, at least, with the first one, 1 in 10 times I get that joy of the scratch off and seeing it's a win. So that's sort of an explanation.




And that would say that lotteries are good. The other way economists might think about lotteries is they're voluntary taxes. The public doesn't like taxes. Here's a voluntary tax.




You never hear policy makers getting up and railing against a horrible evils of the lottery. Sometimes groups do. Sometimes outside groups do and stuff. But politicians don't. But those same politicians will go on and on about how terrible taxes are. I'm going to cut your taxes. Taxes are terrible.




Well, the lottery is a voluntary tax in that sense. And I might say, look, there's no reason to oppose it, it's a voluntary tax. It's those involuntary taxes that cause problems in society. Well, whether we want to
buy that story or not depends on how much we think it's being played because people are stupid or not.




OK. Let me stop there. So that's a great example of how a little bit of an extension of our model can really enrich our understanding about a lot of decisions that we make in the real world. We'll come back and talk about another version like that later. And that is the case of thinking about savings decisions and thinking about individual decisions on how much to save and how much to spend.

[[Comparative Advantage: The Market for Roses]]
PROFESSOR: The first 2/3 of the course were covering sort of what you need to know to know basic microeconomics-- consumer theory and producer theory. And basically you can now, if you understand the material, go forth in the world as a qualified micro economist. What we're going to do for the rest of the semester is apply what we've learned and show you how you can use the tools that we've learned from basic consumer and producer theory to understand a broader range of phenomena.




Really, you can think of this as-- as I talked in the first lecture about we make simplifying assumptions-- this is sort of as we bend those simplifying assumptions, and consider more and more realistic applications of these models. And the hint of what the sort of stuff you can get to see as you move on in economics and move to our other courses beyond micro.




So what we're going to start with today-- and of course, unfortunately, since I'm going to cover a lot of topics, I'll give each way too little time. Including today, which is one lecture on international trade. You could take several courses on it. We have an excellent undergrad course, 14.54 on international trade. And I'm going to sort of try to shove down your throats in one lecture the key things you need to know about international trade. But if you find it interesting I urge you to follow up on this.




So, thinking about this-- a good way to think about international trade is to think about an example. So let's think about Valentine's Day. Valentine's Day sort of presents an interesting conundrum. Because Valentine's Day happens in the winter. And yet, the thing you're supposed to do is give roses. Which don't grow in the winter in the US. At least not very conveniently in many places. So you've got this difficult issue that basically we're supposed to represent this holiday with something that doesn't actually come that time of year. So historically what that meant it was if you wanted to get roses for Valentine's Day you to buy them from specially heated greenhouses. Where they set up largely to supply the roses for Valentine's Day. There wasn't really a large purpose for them otherwise.

However, over the past couple of decades, what's happened is instead-- instead of growing these in these specially heated greenhouses, we've started flying them in from other places, from Colombia. Where of course, Colombia's on the other side of the equator. So February is a wonderful time to grow roses in Colombia. And as a result we've started flying them in. And the typical rose you will give on Valentine's Day this year will come from Colombia.




Now the issue is-- is that a good thing or a bad thing? Now on the one hand, we get cheap roses. That's good. Especially for poor college students who want to impress their valentine by sending a dozen roses. It's good they're cheap. And roses are way cheaper now than they were when I was-- even in dollar terms when I was in college giving roses. Roses are just incredibly cheap now compared to 20 or 30 years ago.




On the other hand, a lot of rose producers have lost their jobs. A lot of people whose livelihoods and source of income was growing these roses are now out of jobs. OK, these are typically people who are not high-skilled people who can go find another job easily. These are people who have been really displaced for something which was a specialized skill which they cannot easily use other places.




And basically this trade-off is sort of a microcosm of the debate we have over international trade every day. A debate that's ongoing. Obama just came back to the G20 summit. Where there was huge discussions of the issues of international trade. It's an ongoing debate. And it's a particularly important topic right now in the US because the US is running what's called an enormous trade deficit.




The trade deficit is the difference between how much we export, that is how much of our goods we sell to other countries, minus how much we import. Which is how much of goods from other countries that we buy. Currently we export about $160 billion worth of goods every month. So every month we send out $160 billion worth of goods around the world. We import about $200 billion of goods every month.




So that means we have a trade deficit that's running about $40 billion. Now the question is-- is that a problem? Is it a problem that the US is systematically buying more stuff from the rest of the world than they're buying from us? And the answer is it's not necessarily a problem. And really, it might in fact be a natural outcome because of the principle that we'll focus on today-- the principle of comparative advantage.

Comparative advantage is saying if some other place is particularly good at producing roses in February, then we shouldn't be that stressed about the fact that we're running a deficit of roses. That's something which is OK in terms of total efficiency. So to see that, let's focus as this rose example in a particularly simplified way.




Imagine there's two countries-- the US and Colombia. And there's only two goods in the world-- roses and computers. Two countries, two good models. The standard model we work with with international trade. With two country two good models you can develop almost everything you need to know. There is no need to make it more complicated.




Now, as I mentioned it's really hard to grow roses in February in the US. It's a lot easier in Colombia. On the other hand, it's much easier to produce good computers in the US than in Colombia because we have the high skilled labor force that can produce computers. So we have a thing where the US is relatively bad at producing roses in February. Colombia's relatively bad at producing computers.




So the key point is that means that the opportunity cost-- remember the opportunity cost, this key concept we've come back to a couple times. The opportunity cost of producing a rose in terms of producing computers is relatively high in the US. That is to produce a rose we have to use so many resources. Those resources can be much more effectively deployed to producing computers.




Likewise, in Colombia, to produce a computer would use a ton of resources that would be much more effectively deployed to produce roses. As a result we see that Colombia has a comparative advantage in roses. And the US has a comparative advantage in computers. The point is that if a country is relatively good at something then they have a comparative advantage. And it's all about relativities. Because people are going to want both. But the key thing is who's relatively good at producing one versus the other.




So to see that let's go to figure 19-1. To see how we diagram this, let's go to figure 19-1. Figure 19-1 shows production possibility frontiers. You learned about these a while back. Let me remind you, a production possibility frontier we talked about in the context of a firm. It shows the trade-off between the firm's ability to produce one good versus another good. So for a firm producing two goods a production possibilities frontier is the combination of the two goods they could produce at a given level of inputs.

So we talked about it from the context of firms. We can also talk about this in the context of countries. That says, we can draw a US production possibility frontier. Which is given the resources the US has, it could produce up to 2000 computers and no roses. Or 1,000 dozen roses, boxes of roses, and no computers. And let's assume it's linear in between.




So the US production possibility frontier is given the resources we have-- and this is a very simplified example-- but just bear with me. Given the resources we have, we can produce 2000 computers and no roses or 1,000 boxes of roses and no computers. Or any combination in between. That's our production possibility frontier.




Columbia has a  production possibility frontier illustrated in the second panel. They can produce 1,000 computers and no roses. Or 2000 boxes of roses and no computers. That is, Columbia has a comparative advantage in roses. Meaning that their production possibility frontier is a lot flatter than ours is. We have a comparative advantage in computers. Meaning our production possibility frontier is a lot steeper
than is Colombia's. Ignore panel C for the moment.




Now remember what the slope of the production possibility frontier is. It's the marginal rate of technical substitution. It's the marginal rate at which the producer can substitute one good for another. So basically, for the US, the marginal rate of substitution of roses for computers is -2. That is you have to give up two computers to get one box of roses. In Colombia it's -1/2. You have to give up 1/2 a computer to get a box of roses. So since the marginal rate of substitution is so much higher in the US, we say that Colombia has a comparative advantage in producing roses.




Now let's go further and impose tastes on consumers in each country. Let's say that tastes are such that given these production possibility frontiers, consumers in the US choose 1,000 computers and 500 boxes of roses. We choose production over love. Colombia chooses love over production. Given their production possibility frontier, this is not inherently about taste necessarily. Because you have very different slopes here. But given their tastes and their production possibility frontier, they choose 500 computers and 1,000 boxes of roses.




Now this we call the outcome. We call this outcome the autarchy outcome. Autarchy. Which is the word-- I don't know what the hell it means, but it basically means no trading. Autarchy. I don't know where it comes from. Must be some Russian term or something. Autarchy. Which means no trading. So the no trading outcome is consumers in the US consume 1,000 computers and 500 boxes of roses. Consumers in Colombia consume 500 computers and 1,000 boxes of roses.


Now the key point is that both the US and Colombia can be better off if we introduce trade. And how is that? Well if we introduced trade, then each country can specialize in their comparative advantage. Trade allows for specialization. That is the key advantage of trade. Their comparative advantage naturally yields specialization.




Comparative advantage naturally yields specialization-- it makes sense for the US to be a computer producer and Columbia to be a rose producer. It doesn't make sense the two countries to produce both. But absent international trade they have to produce both. Because consumers want both. So if we're shut off from the world and Columbia's shut off from the world, then we end up as in figures A and B. But once we introduce trade, then we can take advantage of our relative expertise. And we get a new production possibility frontier which looks like panel C.




That is, if you want more than 2000 computers-- so if you want 2000 computers and 2000 roses-- then you simply have the US produce just computers and Colombia produce just roses. And you can get 2000 of each. Now you can get 3,000 computers and no roses by having everybody produce computers. Or 3,000 roses and no computers by having everybody produce roses. So you know production possibility frontier has its sort of wedge point that 2000-2000 intersection. You can label that point the point of specialization where those two dashed lines hit the solid line. That's the point of specialization, pure specialization. That's the point where the US does just what it's good at. And Colombia does just what it's good at.




Of course you could have other combinations too. And that's what leads to this bent production possibility frontier. But the key point is this joint production possibility frontier is further out than what any country could have produced on its own. We've increased the opportunity set. Specialization has led to a larger opportunity set. A larger opportunity set-- we've expanded the opportunity set for the world by allowing countries to specialize.




And the result of that you can see in the next figure. In figure 19-2 which shows gains from trade. So what this figure shows-- this is the same autarchy figure from panels A and B before. I've just added some more labels. So what we see is, in autarchy, we're at point C- sub US. With the US producing and consuming 1,000 computers and 500 boxes of roses.

If we move to specialization, move to international trade, what happens is the US moves to producing 2000 computers at Q-US. And, likewise, looking at the second panel, Colombia moves to producing 2000 box of roses at Q-CO. And US consumers now increase their consumption of both roses and computers. As do Colombian consumers. And you end up with total consumption of 2000 computers and 2000 roses. So the US consumes 1250 computers and Colombia consumes 750. And the flip for roses. So we are learning that Colombians, even at the same price, do prefer love over production.




But nonetheless, the bottom line is, both sets of consumers are better off. Both sets of consumers are consuming at a higher point than was possible without trade. It's magic. The magic is that simply by letting them trade we have made both countries better off. And the magic, the key to the magic, is specialization and comparative advantage. If the US and Colombia were identical in terms of their production possibility frontiers then you should be able to see that there would be no gains from trade. If they had the same production possibility frontier, if in A and B the slopes were the same, then the joint production possibility frontier would be identical to what's in each country. There would be no gains from trade.




Gains from trade come from the fact that these production possibility frontiers have different slopes. That there's comparative advantage in one country and not another. Which allows specialization. So, basically, the key insight of international trade-- and once again I'm doing now in 50 minutes what you do in 12 lectures when you get it right. But the rough insight is that comparative advantage yields specialization, yields gains from trade. That's sort of the chain of logic to be thinking about this.




Questions about that? Yeah?




AUDIENCE: If we're going to adjust to international situations? Or could it be any sort of specialization between two companies?




PROFESSOR: Any specialization between two companies. So just we learned about this originally in the context of companies. Same issue. In the business world they have a term for this. What do they call it? Synergy. You all know that word, you've got to if you're going to business school. Synergy. Synergy means that somehow you put two companies together and they can produce the same stuff better. Synergy is a fancy name for this. Which is the idea is that there may be gains from specialization even within a company. But if you take the old example, take two shoe companies, both producing left and right shoes inefficiently and they could specialize. And one could do better producing left shoes and one at right shoes. You put them together and overall you can have more shoes. That's actually a pretty stupid example, but you get the point.




That basically the same principle can occur whenever there are gains from trade. Whenever there's comparative advantage of specialization you make gains from trade. Good question. Other questions?



[[Sources of Comparative Advantage]]
Now, that raises the interesting question of-- well these comparative advantage things sound great. Where can I get one? Where do comparative advantages come from? And there's really two sources of comparative advantages. Comparative advantage in international trade. So where does comparative advantage come from? One is differences in factor endowment.




Differences in factor endowment. What that means, is that for example, Canada has a ton of trees. Everywhere. Canada is endowed with an enormous amount of lumber resources. With that factor very well. So Canada is an enormous exporter of lumber and paper products. Because they happen to have the main thing you need for that which is unbelievable amounts of trees, everywhere. So Canada can specialize in exporting lumber and paper.




So now that gives them a comparative advantage in that area. Now let me ask you another question. Why does China export most of the world's clothes now? What?




AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]




PROFESSOR: Cheap labor. It's not that they have cheaper textiles. It's not that the cloth itself-- and I realize that the silkworms are in China. But not like the actual production of cloth is that much cheaper. It's that clothes are primarily a labor intensive good. And the labor is cheapest in China. So they have a factor endowment. They have an advantage, comparative advantage, in labor intensive goods. So China, with international trade, will produce a disproportionate share of labor intensive goods. Because they can specialize in labor intensive goods. And make them cheaper for the rest of the world.




So likewise, a sweatshirt that you would go and buy today-- especially if you go and buy it at a not top end store. At an Old Navy or even at a Costco. Is literally in dollar terms cheaper than what I paid for that same sweatshirt when I was in college in the early 1980s. Because they're just produced incredibly cheaply in China now. We bring them in and they're just cheap. Goods where you can specialize in that are going to be-- when you take advantage of specialization will be a lot cheaper. So that's one reason why you see comparative advantage.




The second reason is going to be technological leadership. Technological leadership. So, for example, Japan has no natural comparative advantage of producing cars. There's no reason why Japan should have a comparative advantage of producing cars over the US. Except they developed the technology to more efficiently mass produce the modern automobile. As a result of that technological leadership they gave themselves, essentially, comparative advantage.




Now, once that technology becomes public, the production shifts elsewhere. So now China is a major producer of cars. Basically copy-catting the technology developed in Japan. So it does move elsewhere. Unlike factor endowments-- if the US wanted to compete with Canada I guess we could plant trees and in 50 years we would compete. But factor endowments are kind of hard to compete on. Technology is potentially a little bit easier because you can reverse engineer things.




So once again, the technology's shifting to China. So really the answer is in the long run everything's going to be made in China. Because they've got the cheap labor. And they're adopting the technology. And once again, to quote towards our most important sense of cultural relevance, there's the episode of the Simpsons where Homer says, don't worry we're fine. We're going to rule-- our country's going to rule the world. We're fine in the future. He goes, wait a second we're China, right? So basically China is doing very well because they've got these factor endowments-- these great factor endowments and because they are adopting technology as well.




What's interesting about this is this really leads to some more interesting policy issues. Once again, factor endowment you can't do a whole lot about. The interesting policy issues are in technological progress. This is an argument that many people make for subsidizing new technologies. So you often hear President Obama saying, we need to subsidize green technologies. This is the wave of the future. The idea, what he's saying implicitly is if we get the technological leadership, we can make the green products that are exported. Not the color-- I mean environmental stuff-- that can be exported to the rest of the world. And that's the argument that he's making.




Question about that?

[[Impact of International Trade on Welfare]]
Now let's talk about where we started the lecture, which is is trade a good thing or a bad thing? I just talked about how trade can greatly increase consumption possibilities. But why haven't we talked about the consumers? What about overall social welfare. And the answer is that trade unambiguously increases social welfare. That trade is unambiguously a good thing to do.




So to see that let's go to the next series of figures. Start with figure 19-3. So let's start with the market for roses and imagine we have-- [INAUDIBLE] autarchy is sometimes spelled with a K, sometimes with a CH, I don't know what the right way to spell it is. But anyway, you have autarchy. So the US-- imagine the old days where we produced all our roses and we're at some equilibrium with some consumer surplus and producer surplus. So we produce Q sub A roses at a price p sub A.




Now, in figure 19-4 we're going to introduce international trade. It's a little confusing, so let's go through it slowly. Figure 19-4. You can find on that figure the domestic supply and the domestic demand. And they intersect at point A. Figure 19-4, domestic supply and domestic demand intersect at A. Which is once again a quantiy of Q sub A and a price of P sub a.




Now let's say that what happens is we now allow imports of roses. We now trade with Colombia for roses. What that does is that means now instead of just drawing on the domestic supply, we can now draw on the world's supply of roses. We don't have to just rely on domestic supply. Well, that by definition has shifted further out. And it's shifted further out because other countries countries can produce roses so much more cheaply than we can. So we can rely on the world's supply of roses.




Remember my cotton example where you first buy from the cheapest country, then the next cheapest country, et cetera. This is what we're saying-- if the US was the cheapest producer of roses, this wouldn't shift out. But since the US is not the cheapest producer of roses this shifts out to world supply. And we get to a new equilibrium at quantity C sub t. That's the new quantity of roses we consume. And a lower price P sub w. The horizontal line's a little distracting, actually. But basically what you have here-- the horizontal line is just showing the price in autarchy and the world price.




But the bottom line is, what you get you get is you get this new equilibrium with a quantity C sub t and a price P sub w. And in particular, what we're seeing is that total domestic consumption of roses has increased. But domestic production has fallen. Because look, the new price intersects the supply curve at Q sub t. So what happens is at that new lower price P sub w, US rose producers aren't actually producing as much. So US domestic production falls from Q sub a to Q sub t.


But US consumption rises from Q sub a to C sub t. The difference is imports. Production falls from Q sub a to Q sub t. Consumption rises from Q sub a to C sub t. The difference is imports. And that's what happens when we allow Colombia to send us roses.




What are the welfare implications of that? Let's go to figure 19-5. And what you can see is we can show you the welfare implications. Previously consumer surplus was W. Producer surplus was X plus that other white triangle below X. Now what's happened? Consumer surplus has gone up by X, because consumers have gained that plus z. So consumers have gained that entire trapezoid, X plus Z.




Producers have lost x. Producers have lost that trapezoid, X. So in total we've gained Z. We've gained that entire triangle, Z. Z is the entire triangle on both sides of the dashed line. So we've gained all of Z. Consumers gained X plus Z, producers lost X. We've gained Z. So overall we've increased welfare in the US.




So basically consumers win, producers lose. And that's the problem. The political problem we have. And I'll come back to this. What you can see is consumers win, producers lose. But by definition, consumers win more than producers lose. So overall, social surplus has gone up. Now that's the case of imports.




Now what about exports? Well if imports make us better, do exports make us worse? We just said imports make us better. What about exports? Well let's look at that in figure 19-6.




Now figure 19-6 shows what happens with exports. Once again we start at point A, the domestic outcome, point A. And now we're talking about computers. So now the US is going to export computers. What that means is that the supply of computers to people in the US is going to fall. why? Because a bunch of them are going to get sent away. So it used to be US consumers got to consume on that domestic supply-- so US producers used domestic supply curve. And we had domestic demand intersecting at A. Well now, domestic producers are shipping a bunch of the computers to Japan, and China, and Colombia.




As a result, the supply has shifted in. Because they don't have as many computers to sell in the US. That means the price rises. So because of exports we pay more for our computers. And it sort of makes sense, right? They produce a bunch of computers. If there's been a great demand for them elsewhere and we want them too, we're going to have to pay a higher price. Because we're competing with other people for those computers.




So now that supply curve has shifted up. And now we end up that US consumers only want to C sub t computers at a new higher price a P sub w. But the world is now saying, well we are interested in the total amount of computer we want is Q sub t. So what that world price of sub w-- the domestic producers say great, at that higher price P sub w, I'm delighted to produce Q sub t computers.




So what I'm going to do is I'm going to produce Q sub t, I'm going to ship Q sub t minus C sub t elsewhere. And US consumers will consume C sub t. So consumers are worse off. So unlike imports which make consumers better off, consumers are worse off. So is trade bad?




Well, no. Trade's not bad. But the bottom line is, domestic producers are going to gain more than domestic consumers lose. The bottom line is we'll be better off from exports. But in this case, consumers lose and producers win. Society gains either way. Society gains from imports because consumers gain more than producers lose. Society gains from exports. Because producers gain more than consumers lose.



[[Trade Restrictions: Tariffs ]]
So what that means is that any form of trade is going to make the US better off. But also inevitably create losers. Any form of trade will make the US better off but inevitably create losers. And the problem is that those losers are very loud in the political process. And the winners are not so loud. So, for example, if you polled US consumers and said, how much are you saving on your sweat shirts? Because we import textiles from China. They wouldn't know. I mean they'd say a couple bucks what in fact it's maybe-- they'd say I don't know, 10% of the price when it's maybe more like 50% of the price. But if you polled US textile manufacturers, or guys who have left the business, and said how much did you lose because of imports of China, they'd tell you exactly how much they lost. They'd tell you 10 times as much. But they know how much they lost. And they go to their politicians and they say, hey we're losing jobs here. And the consumers don't come saying, hey I'm getting cheaper sweatshirts here.




As a result, there's huge political backlash against imports in particular. So that leads to policies which limit imports into countries like the US. Like tariffs, which are essentially taxes. Tariffs, which are essentially taxes on goods imported into the US to us. Which are taxes on goods that are imported into the US. Or quotas, which are limits on how much companies can send to the US. What I think what you should know now is by definition-- since I said free trade is good, these things are going to be bad. And they're going to be bad-- things like tariffs are going to be bad because they're going to hurt US consumers more than they're going to help US producers.




So to see that let's go to figure 19-8. Let's show what happens with a tariff. This is saying that now we're starting the world with trade. So the world with trade we're producing C sub 1, which is where domestic demand equals world supply at a price P sub w. That's where we were with trade. Now the US government comes in and levies a tariff. And says that that tariff is going to be the difference between P sub w and P sub t. So that's the amount of the tariff. They are going to raise the price essentially to P sub t. They're essentially going to levy a tax on roses that come in from Colombia.




What that does is that means that consumers now, at that higher price, only want C sub 2 roses. That's where that intersects demand. So they wanted C sub 1 roses without the tariff. But now with the tariff at that higher price intersects demand at C sub 2, they only want C sub 2 roses.




Producers, given that they have to pay the tariff, are only going to produce Q sub 2. Domestic producers are now going to produce Q sub 2 roses because they get a higher price. So domestic consumers are consuming less. Domestic producers are producing more. Right, because now that price is higher. So now you could reopen those heated greenhouses because it's worth it now. And we end up with a much smaller amount of imports. So in that sense the tariff worked. So in the sense that the goal of the tariff was to reduce imports, it worked. Consumers wanted less from Colombia. Producers were happy to produce more. So imports fell. So in that sense tariffs worked. They've lowered imports.




But what do they do to welfare? Well that's our final figure 19-9. What do they do to welfare? Well what you can see is domestic producers gained a trapezoid A. Their producer surplus, which used to be that little white triangle below A, became that entire triangle that includes A and the white part below it. So their producer surplus became A. They gained A in producer surplus.




But consumers lost a ton. They lost the entire trapezoid A plus B plus C plus D. They lost that entire trapezoid gone up to higher prices. And now we have one other player which is the government. The government made some money. This is a tax. How much did the government make? Well we taxed all imports by the amount P sub t minus P sub w. So the government made the rectangle C. The government made C because we got to tax all the important at that tariff.


So on net, society as a whole is worse off by B plus D. Consumers have lost the entire A plus B plus C plus D. Producers got some of that, the government got some of that. But some of it's dead weight loss. Trades that would have made consumers better off, and worldwide producers better off that are not happening.




So this tariff, it had its effect. It lowered imports. But at the same time it lowered social surplus. So restrictions on trade lower welfare. And this is why economists like free trade. Because restrictions on trade lower welfare.




Are there questions about that?




Moreover, this is just what we call static analysis. What else could happen if the US government voted a tariff on roses coming from Colombia? What else might happen? Yeah?




AUDIENCE: Colombia might vote for a tariff on the U.S.




PROFESSOR: Columbia might vote for a tariff against computers coming from the US. Which of course would hurt Colombian consumers. But would also hurt US producers.




So from the US's prospective, that would be even worse. So think about it-- we put a tariff on Colombian roses which hurt us. Then Colombia puts a tariffs on US computers which hurts us even further-- hurts Colombia too, but we don't care about them, we care about us. It hurts us even further. So dynamically restrictions on trade can be even worse than it looks in this diagram. If they cause a trade war you can actually end up with things being even worse than you look at this diagram.




So we talked about why economists like free trade-- partly so that the gains to consumers exceed the losses to producers. But partly it's because free trade begets free trade. And that exports make us better off too. So by allowing free trade not only do we increase our welfare by having more imports, we also increased our welfare by allowing more exports. And in fact, producers as a class, if they could all get together and have a cooperative equilibrium, they might be fine without restrictions of trade. Because the computer producers and the rose producers get together and say, wait a second, we can trade, on net we win from this. On net we win from free trade. Let's get together and make a deal.




But of course we know that's going to be an incredibly hard cooperative equilibrium to enforce. And that's why you have different sets of producers. You have the rose producers lobbying the congressmen. Then they leave and the computer producers walk in his office and lobby him the other way. So you have producers lobbying for different effects depending if they're competing with imports or they're exporting. They're going to lobby for and against trade restrictions.



[[The Argument for Free Trade]]
Moreover, there's yet another thing we've missed. There's yet another thing we've missed. So we've talked about the dead weight loss. We've talked about trade wars. But let's say for a second-- let's think about a third thing. Let's say for a second we're not just heartless selfish Americans. But we actually do care about the rest of the world. Well the third thing we miss is allowing trade from Colombia makes Colombia better off too.




So not only have we improved our welfare by importing Colombian roses, we've improved their welfare too. And they're a poor country. And we should be happy to improve their welfare too. We think about free trade in Vietnam. That is the application for child labor. By allowing the import of Vietnamese rice we improved the lives of the Vietnamese children. So independent of the fact we've made our lives better off we've made these other country's lives better off too.




So there's three reasons why we should have free trade. There's the simple welfare gain, there's the dynamic welfare gain, and there's the fact that we might care about the welfare of other countries as well.




And as a result, there's been a huge emphasis over time in trying to increase free trade. By economists saying this for years, things going back to the early economists. But we've made a lot of headway in the last 20 years. And in particular, one big source of headway was NAFTA-- The North American Free Trade Agreement. Which was passed under Clinton. Which basically demolished trade barriers between Canada the US and Mexico. There used to be a lot of trade barriers. We would tax Canadian lumber. They would tax our computers. We would tax Mexican whatever they sent to us. They would tax our stuff. It was a mess. So basically NAFTA said let's just get rid of all of it. Let's have a cooperative agreement. Let's have a cooperative agreement whereby we all agree to get rid of trade barriers and thereby making all of us better off.


And it seems like it would be a pretty simple thing to do. But it was a mess. And it was very hard. And it was very hard because now you had parties in every country opposing this. You had you had the Canadian computer producers getting upset. You had the Mexican computer producers getting upset. You had the US lumber industry getting upset. And you had huge difficulties because you had parties in every case opposing it.




And the reason free trade agreements are so difficult-- now eventually NAFTA did pass. And has been by most measures a huge success. But ultimately the major difficulty here is in another failure of government policy. Which is the inability of the government to effectively tax the winners and compensate the losers from international trade. That is-- if the government could work as a perfect-- in the way that I design it to work-- what would happen is that we would tax sweatshirts and take the money from taxing sweatshirts and send it to compensate the guys who lost jobs in the textile industry.




And if we did that, we can make life much better off than with the tariff. So if consider two outcomes. One is we don't import Chinese sweatshirts. The other is that we import them but we levy a small tax on all sweatshirts not just Chinese lectures. Levy a small tax on all sweatshirts. We import Chinese sweatshirts but then we levy a tax on all sweatshirts. And we use that sweatshirt tax money to pay off the guys who lost their jobs in the textile industry. That would be better for society than would not allow sweatshirts to come in in the first place.




So the fundamental failure in trade policy ultimately is a failure is that inability of the government to effectively compensate the losers by taxing the winners. Because just as the losers know to go to lobby Congress, the winners will get pissed off if you start taxing sweatshirts. Because they don't realize that they're saving all this money from all these imports. And in fact the typical American voter would probably vote to block Chinese imports before they'd vote to have a tax on their sweatshirts.




So really in some sense when you have a very concentrated set of winners or losers competing against a very concentrated set of losers, defeating against a very diffuse set of winners, that's a hard policy to get in place. Unless you can figure out a way to get those winners to compensate the losers. And that's the tricky thing.




Are there question about that? About free trade agreements, things like that? Now what I want to talk about for a couple minutes then one subtlety in these free trade agreements. And why things like NAFTA are hard. And the reason they're hard is because this makes enormous sense. Free trade agreements make enormous sense if it's true comparative advantage like Canada has more trees. But what if Mexico's source of comparative advantage is that they treat their workers like shit. What if China's source of comparative advantage is that they have incredibly bad working conditions? And they have incredibly bad environmental conditions? China has an incredibly bad environmental situation. It is incredibly dangerous just to live in major Chinese cities. The working conditions are awful. The wages are terrible.




Nonetheless, the result is very, very cheap labor. Then things get a little dicier. Because if the Chinese labor was cheap or Mexican labor was cheap just because inherently that was just the way life was. At the same working conditions and the same environmental conditions they were just cheaper, then that's great. That's the comparative advantage. But if they're cheap because they exploit their population and put them in horrible working conditions and facing horrible environmental conditions, then the welfare gets a little trickier.




From the US's prospective it doesn't get any trickier. The US-- our welfare is exactly the same. We get these static and dynamic gains from trade. But from a world perspective, now we're maybe not so sure we want to promote Mexico producing more clothes or China producing more clothes. Because it could just lead to more exploitation of the population. So this comes back to when I talked about free trade in Vietnam and child labor. Which is if free trade actually let to an increased use of child labor in Vietnam we might worry that gee maybe this isn't such a good thing.




So really what it comes down to is we have to think not just about the simple dead weight loss triangles and squares. We have to think about some broader social issues as well. And once again there is a right answer here. And this is what a lot was fought over with NAFTA. Which is one of the conditions for NAFTA was the US actually lobbied and got significantly improved work and environmental standards in Mexico. This was like an opposite of a trade war. Instead of being a vicious cycle, this was a virtuous cycle. We actually improved the life for workers in Mexico because Mexico is willing to do that in order to get the benefits of trade with the US.




So just like limiting trade with Mexico will hurt us and hurt Mexico, expanding trade with Mexico and then tying it to improve work conditions and environmental conditions can make both countries really much better off. And so that's where, once again, trade becomes very interesting. And why it's worth studying further. Because it's not as simple as these boxes. It's thinking about where comparative advantage comes from. And whether we really want to promote trade with countries that have comparative advantage depending on the source of what that comparative advantage is.




And that's sort of the free trade versus fair trade argument. The bottom line in that argument-- the free trade versus fair trade argument-- the bottom line is free trade is always a good thing. But fair trade considerations can be used to try to make it work better than just simply unfettered free trade. And so really both sides have a point in this debate. So let me stop there. That's international trade. We're going to come back on Wednesday to talk about uncertainty and whether you should play the lottery.
[[Determining Demand for Labor]]
PROFESSOR: OK, so what we're going to do today is the last in what I'd say are the core set of lectures. Our core set of lectures, we started with talking about the market. We then moved on and talked about consumer theory and did a series of lectures on that. Now we're doing producer theory. This is the last in our series of lectures on producer theory and then basically we move on to topics.




So the remainder of the section we'll talk about things like international trade, uncertainty, equity and efficiency, asymmetric information in insurance markets. We'll move on to in the last part of the course showing you how you can apply what we've learned in the basics to answer a bunch of interesting, real world questions. So this is the last of our core basics lectures.




What we're going to do here is fit in something that's fallen through the cracks, which is we've talked about firms and their decisions about how much to produce. And we've talked about the output side.
But we haven't talked about the input side at all. How do firms decide what kind of the inputs to use and in what ratio to use et cetera.




We talked a bit about it. We talked about isoquants and isocosts and doing that tradeoff between inputs. We haven't really talked about the input markets themselves. So firms go and they say, look I've done my isoquants and isocosts and I want 63 workers. Well they've then got to go to a market for labor and hire those workers and how does that actually work.




So today what we want to focus on is the demand side of input markets. That is, what's the actual market analysis by which a firm having maximized its profits and deciding how many workers it wants goes and actually finds those workers.




So we're going to do is talk about demand for factors. In particular today we'll focus on the demand for labor. Although the demand for capital, the analysis will be very similar. But today we're going to focus

on the demand for labor. And what we're going to do is begin by focusing on the demand for labor in a competitive factor market.




So we're going to begin by talking about competitive factor markets. What I mean by that is that a perfectly competitive factor market is one where, just as perfect competition and output markets means there's lots of sellers selling the same good, a perfectly competitive factor market means there's lots of sellers, in this case workers, selling an identical good. That is their labor.




So the notion is we're in a market where there's many, many workers firms could hire, all of whom are equally qualified for a job. So this is not, obviously, a high-tech market. This is some low-tech, construction, other sort of blue collar market, where there's lots of workers out there who could equally well be qualified for a job.




In fact what we're going to assume is that there's a perfectly flat labor supply curve. Let's assume a perfectly flat labor supply curve. Perfectly elastic labor supply just to make life easy. Obviously it's not true in reality. Let's assume we're looking at some market with perfectly elastic labor supply.




Now how do we think about what happens in factor markets in that world? Well once again let's start with the short run. So in the short run capital's fixed.




So a firm has said, look, I've done my short run profit maximization, my isoquants and isocosts. I've decided how many workers I want given a fixed level of capital. And that gives me some demand for labor. I can derive a demand for labor curve by essentially saying, at different wage rates, given a fixed capital price, that will shift my isocost curve, going back to the producer theory, at different wage rates that will shift my isocost curve, that will cause me to demand different amounts of labor. So that traces out a demand curve for labor.




And we can see that graphically in figure 18-1. So you've got a perfectly elastic labor supply curve and then you've got a downward sloping labor demand curve. And that labor demand curve comes from the profit maximization.

The other way to think about how we get there though is interesting. You say, how do we think about the marginal benefit versus the marginal cost of hiring another worker. We know the marginal cost is the wage, that's easy. What's the marginal benefit of hiring another worker?




Well recall that another unit of labor raises output by the marginal product of labor. Remember the marginal product of labor. We talked about this a while ago. This is delta q delta l. So the next worker raises your output by an amount marginal product of labor. That's what you get from the next worker.




But that's a quantity. The firm cares about profit not quantity. So what it cares about is revenues. So the revenues from the next worker would be the marginal revenues that are made on that next unit times the marginal product of labor. That's the marginal benefit to the firm of the next unit of labor is the marginal product that that worker produces times the marginal revenue the firm raises from selling that next unit.




So they have to consider two things, two margins. How much is it worth them to sell that next unit and how much will be produced by that next unit of worker? So if we have a perfectly competitive labor market, the marginal cost is going to be the wage. So we're going to set this equal to the wage.




So in a perfectly competitive labor market the marginal cost of another worker is the wage and this is the marginal benefit of another worker. So this is going to be the condition the firm's going to use to decide how many workers to hire.




We're going to call this the marginal revenue product of labor. So you're going to set the marginal revenue product of labor equal to the wage. That's going to be your profit maximizing condition-- the marginal revenue product.




The marginal product is about quantities. Marginal revenue product is about dollars. What's the dollars that the next unit of labor produces for you is your marginal revenue product.




Now if the output market is also perfectly competitive. That is, imagine for a minute now, take one further step. Not a perfectly competitive labor supply but also a perfectly competitive output market. So it's not a monopolist. It's selling in a perfectly competitive output market. Then we know what the marginal revenue is. We know the marginal revenue is the price.



So for a perfectly competitive output market we could rewrite this as price times marginal product of labor equals the wage. Because we know the marginal revenue is the price in a perfectly competitive output market.




And basically this makes it even easier to see which is to say, look, how many workers do you hire? You hire until the wage you pay that worker is equal to the price you sell your good for times how many goods that worker produces. If one worker produces 100 goods and each good sells for 100, then you'll only pay the worker $10,000. Basically that is going to determine your labor demand curve. And so the labor demand curve is also labeled the marginal revenue product of labor curve, I'm sorry.




Why is this diminishing? Why is it downward sloping? Because remember the marginal product of labor's diminishing. The marginal product of labor's diminishing. As a result this curve is downward sloping. Now here price is fixed, so it doesn't matter. Marginal revenue also is diminishing so that's going to make it even more downward sloping than the more general case.




But in this specific case of perfectly competitive output markets where this is just a constant price you get this downward sloping marginal revenue product of labor curve because the marginal product of labor is diminishing, as we talked about. So that's the analysis of what we see for a perfectly competitive factor market. So the equilibrium is where the labor supply curve, which is perfectly elastic, intersects this marginal revenue product curve, which is determined by how productive the workers are and how much money they're making for you with each unit they produce. And that gets you the short run equilibrium.




Questions about that? Questions about what we're doing here? So that just says the underlying analysis of where demand for labor comes from or where the equilibrium level of labor is going to come. It's going to come from intersection of this demand with the supply, which is flat.




Now how is this going to differ in the long run? Well let me ask the question this way, forget the math, forget the graphs, I'm just going to ask you intuitively. In the long run, do we think the long run demand for workers will be more elastic or less elastic than the short run demand, in general. Will the long run demand curve, this is short run demand curve, will the long run demand curve typically be more elastic or less elastic than the short run demand curve for workers? Somebody take a guess. Yeah.

AUDIENCE: More elastic.




PROFESSOR: More elastic. Why? It's more elastic. But intuitively, don't worry about the graph, I'm just looking for intuition. Yeah.




AUDIENCE: Because in the long run you can substitute capital.




PROFESSOR: Exactly. More substitutability equals more elasticity. General intuition you want to remember for this course. In the long run if I can substitute towards capital, then that long run demand curve for labor will be even more elastic than the short run demand curve. I'm not going to work through the math or anything. I just want you to remember that intuition that when you have more margins you can use, that's more substitutability, that means more elasticity.




So the idea is in the short run, if the wage increases for workers all you can do is if you hire fewer workers you just produce less, so you're sort of stuck. But in the long run if the wage decreases you just say, fine, I'll just use machines instead. So in the long run you can substitute away from workers towards machines. So in the long run your demand curve is going to be more elastic. Questions about that?



[[The Monopsony Model]]
Now this is all relatively straightforward, just follows from producer theory. The sort of stuff you had to do in the exam last night. Let's now talk about a little more interesting case which is one of my other favorite words in economics which is the case of monopsony. Not monopoly, but monopsony.




We've been talking in lectures about monopoly which is the case where one firm is the only seller in the output market. One firm is the only seller in the output market. A parallel case in input markets is the case of monopsony which is when one firm is the only demander in the input market.




So monopoly is when one firm is the only seller in the output market. The parallel in input markets is monopsony which is where one firm is the only buyer in the input market. And the key thing that's going to drive monopsony is that when there are barriers to exit from a factor market it's going to create a monopsony. And any time there are barriers to exit, any time workers are stuck and cannot leave a market, workers are stuck working one place, that will give the employer market power over those workers.



The classic example is the company town. In the 1800s when there were mining operations and they'd come in and they'd hire people. And basically there was nowhere else to work in the area. These were areas which were dying agricultural areas there was nowhere else to work. You'd go work for the mining company. That mining company had tremendous monopsony power over you because basically there was nowhere else to work within a decent area. There weren't cars yet. You couldn't just commute to somewhere else.




A modern example is MIT's monopsony power over me. MIT has monopsony power over me. Why is that?




Well that's because my life's pretty comfortable now. I'm in a house I've lived in a long time. My kids are in schools I like. I've got a lot of friends. It'd be a real pain in the ass for me to move.




And as a result MIT has some, not unlimited, don't tell them, but they have some monopsony power over me because they know that that's a barrier to my exit. To my exiting MIT a barrier is that I'm very comfortable and satisfied.




And given the nature tenets of psychology, it is harder to move someone with a pull than with the push. So someone could come and try to pull me away, but they're going to have to blow me away with an offer-- once again, don't tell MIT this-- they'll have to blow me away an offer because I'm pretty satisfied. And that satisfaction inherently gives MIT some monopsony power over me.




Now the question is what implications does this have. And the implications are quite interesting. And what they are is a complicated flip of the monopoly case. Let's look at figure 18-2. Here's an example of a company town. Now let's imagine a labor market where you've got some labor demand curve, the marginal revenue product of labor, MRPL, and some labor supply curve.




And now labor supply is upward sloping. This is a not a perfectly competitive labor market now. This labor supply is now upward sloping. So the demand curve for labor we're going to say is 60 minus l. So in our example the marginal revenue product of labor is going to be 60 minus l.

The notion is you have some downward sloping demand curve for labor because of diminishing marginal product. The wage you're willing to pay is diminishing in the number of workers. To get that first worker you'll pay a high wage, because you got to produce something. But as you hire more workers the wage you're willing to pay falls. So the demand curve is downward sloping.




And let's say that our labor supply curve is that the amount of labor workers are willing to supply is the wage over 2. I'm just making this up. These are just made up numbers just to make the math work. So this is it just an upward sloping labor supply curve. A higher wage calls forth more labor. So let's ask what happens in the competitive case.




Well in the competitive case you set the supply equal to the demand. Well supply is that firms are going to set the wage equals 60 minus l. Labor supply is l equals w over 2. So we could just have two equations and two unknowns we can solve and get that the amount of labor supplied in the competitive case is 20 units. 20 hours, 20 days, weeks, whatever. 20 units.




That's the competitive outcome. And the wage we can read off the labor supply curve. If they're going to supply 20 units, they're going to need a wage of 40. So once again we can read that off the labor supply or the labor demand curve if there's going to be 20 workers the wage is going to be 40. So the wage, labor competitive and the wage competitive is 40. So in a competitive market with this demand and supply curve you should know by now you just set them equal, you solve, you get an outcome of 20 workers working a wage of 40.




Now let's imagine this isn't the competitive case. Let's imagine it's the monopsony case. Let's imagine this firm has monopsony power. Workers can't exit. And let's further assume that the firm cannot wage discriminate. Just as we talked about monopolists that couldn't price discriminate, we're going to talk about a firm they can't wage discriminate. It has to pay one wage to all of its workers. And we'll come back once again with this assumption.




Just as we talked about price discrimination we'll come back and talk about wage discrimination. But for now assume a non-wage discriminating monopsonist. They have to pay one wage to all their workers.




Well what that means is just as when a monopolist wanted to sell more goods it had to lower the price, if a monopsonist wants to hire more workers it has to raise the wage. Parallel thing. Just as the monopolist had to lower the price to sell more units because it had to respect the demand curve, a

monopsonist if it wants to hire more workers has to raise the wage because it has to respect the supply curve-- parallel.




And what this will do is that will lead them to under hire workers ct too low a wage. Just as monopoly led firms to under produce at too high a price, monopsony will lead to under hiring at too high a wage. So once again, to think about this, let's think about the firm's decision to hire an extra worker.




What is the firm's total expenditure on labor? Its expenditure on labor is the wage, which is a function of the amount of labor, times the amount of labor. That's the expenditure on labor. So its marginal expenditure, if you take the derivative, is going to be w plus dw/dl times l. That's its marginal expenditure. If you want to hire an additional worker what's the marginal cost.




Well I want to hire an additional worker, what's the cost? I've got a pay him w and to hire him I have to raise the wage, so I have to pay all my previous workers more as well. So to hire one more worker I've got to pay that worker a wage and in order to entice him I've got to raise the wage, which means I've got to pay a higher wage to all my previous workers too.




Once again, remember, I have to pay one wage. So if I'm going to hire that worker there is the same poisoning effect that we saw with monopolists. With monopolists the poisoning effect was if I want to sell one more unit I'm going to have to undercut my price on all previous units. For a monopsonist, if I want to hire one more worker I have to pay all my previous workers more. And that's going to mean that there's a poisoning effective in reverse. That's going to cost me a lot of money to hire that extra worker. So we can actually derive now a marginal expenditure curve just as we derived a marginal revenue curve for the monopolist.




The marginal expenditure curve. So we know expenditure is w of l times l. And we know from the supply curve, we can rewrite this as w equals 2l. So that says that the expenditure on labor is 2l times l. So plugging in from the supply curve the expenditure on labor is 2l times l. Its wage is a function of labor times labor. So 2l times l. So that means that marginal expenditure is 4l. The marginal expenditure is 4l.




So we can now draw a marginal expenditure curve that's steeper than the labor supply curve. Once again it's confusing but it's all parallel. It's just we're flipping everything around from monopolist. Instead of drawing that marginal revenue curve that was steeper than the product demand curve, now we're drawing a marginal expenditure curve which is steeper than the labor supply curve. And once again to find the outcome we'll find the intersection of that marginal expenditure curve with marginal cost.




Well here we'll find the intersection of marginal expenditure curve, I'm sorry, with labor demand. I'm sorry, so the parallel was we found the intersection of marginal revenue with marginal cost. Now find the intersection of marginal expenditure with labor demand. That intersection is going to happen at 12
workers. So the firm is going to hire 12 workers. But what ways you're going to pay-- once again our first temptation is to look at that high intersection and say, well at that intersection what's the wage. We didn't put that on the diagram for a reason. Maybe we should have to throw you off.




Remember, to figure out the wage you've got to respect the labor supply curve. Just like you have to respect the product demand curve to figure out the price. So what's the wage when I hire 12 workers they pay 24. So the monopsonist is going to hire 12 workers and pay 24. It's going to hire the number of workers where marginal expenditure equals the labor demand. That's going to determine the quantity.




And the wage they're going to read off the labor supply curve. And as a result this firm is going to under hire at too low a wage relative to the perfect competition. Relative to the competition they're going to hire fewer workers at a lower wage.




So if you think about this, let's come back to the example of MIT. MIT, say, would like to expand the economics department. But to do so it's got to poach an economics professor away from another university.




Well, it poaches another professor away from another university. And let's say that at MIT pays all its professors the same. If they're going to poach a professor from another university they're going to have to pay the rest of us more. And that's going to cost them a ton of money.




So they think think we'd rather have a little bit more crowded undergrad class, we don't really see it here today, but maybe in general, more crowded undergrad class and not get that extra professor to avoid having to pay a higher wage to all our existing professors. So as a result MIT will under hire professors and they'll under hire professors at too low a wage. And once you can determine how big monopsony power is, what determined how big monopoly power was? What was the key thing I don't want to say what it is because it will give it away, what's the key thing that determined the size of monopoly power. Yeah.



AUDIENCE: Elasticity demand.




PROFESSOR: Elasticity of demand. So just like that, the key factors going to determine the market power of monopsonist is going to be the elasticity of supply of labor. The elasticity of demand for a good is what determined the market power of monopolist because as goods were more elasticity demanded, they had less ability to jack up the price. The elasticity of supply of labor is what's going to determine the market power of monopsonists. Because if I have more options. they can't underpay me.




So if I'm very willing to move to another university. That is as my labor supply curve gets flatter, then there's less market power that they have. In particular, in a perfectly competitive labor market there's no monopsony power at all. So monopsony power is a function of the options facing their workers. Questions about that?



[[Barriers to Wage Discrimination]]
Now the key question this all raises, at least when I first learned about it and think about it, is it maybe was plausible to think that monopolists can only charge one price for their good. That the iPod is what the iPod costs. And you couldn't start charging different amounts for iPods to different people. That would get bad press and stuff.




But it's seems a little bit stranger to think that employers have to pay one wage to all their workers. As a matter of fact we know that MIT doesn't pay the same to all its professors. There is some wage discrimination.




In particular, it's a well known fact that the way to get a raise as a professor is to get an offer from another university. Because MIT, the pay structure professors at competitive departments like economics is typically they will underpay you until the university comes and says you're worth more, and then they'll ratchet up to try to match them. So there is wage discrimination in practice at universities as there is in most workplaces.




There's very few workplaces where all workers make the same. There's wage discrimination. So does that mean this model is irrelevant? And the answer is, no, it doesn't. Because there are still major barriers to perfect wage discrimination. There's some wage discrimination, but there's a lot of barriers to perfect wage discrimination.



The most important one is workplace norms or fairness. So what MIT should do, here's the MIT optimal strategy. The older the professor, the less they should pay them. Not because they're less productive. Marginal productivity is constant, it's not, we get less productive as we get older, but put that aside. It's because the older you are, the less likely you are to get up and move. And the less likely, quite frankly, other universities are going to want to hire you and take you away. Because no one gets that excited about hiring a 60 year old.




So what you should do is take all the 60 over professors and say we're cutting your wage in half or by a third. Because the truth, we've written our lectures already, the wage is already well above our marginal product. We're all doing pretty well anyway. And the truth is people wouldn't leave.




So why doesn't MIT do that? MIT doesn't do that because I'm going to someday be one of those old guys. I'm getting there rapidly. I say, wait a second, if they're going to do to me when I'm 60, I'm going to get out of here while I'm 45 because I don't want to be in that situation. Because that's unfair.




Workplace norms matter. Employers really do not like to discriminate within the workplace because it breeds bad blood and ultimately can lower productivity. And this is something that we miss in our basic models. We don't have fairness and workplace norms in our models. So wage is just about setting the wage that maximizes the profit, which means screwing the 60 year olds. But in fact, in reality, that's not the way workplaces work. And that's what the point of labor economics is.




If you're interested in this we have an excellent course in labor economics that follows up on these issues. But a key issue is how much wage discrimination can be done given workplace norms, given the notions of fairness we have. And the answer is it might be kind of tough. Because basically MIT doesn't want to worry about upsetting all its younger faculty by mistreating its older faculty.




And part of that could be solidarity. Some of those guys are my friends and I feel bad for them. But partly it could be just more selfish which is, I don't want to be at a place that's going to discriminate in that way against me when I get older. And that's just something that's missed by the basic 14.01 models. Questions about that? Yeah.




AUDIENCE: Couldn't you model the person's life wage or something?



PROFESSOR: So yeah. So what you can do is you could say to people, look, when we're hiring you we're going to overpay you relative to other universities when you're young and we'll underpay you when you're older. And so on a lifetime basis you'll be fine. What would the problem with that be? So let's say the say-- yeah.




AUDIENCE: You'd leave.




PROFESSOR: I'd leave as soon as I reached that point where I was being paid more elsewhere that didn't pay this downward slope. And, in fact, there's a lot of interesting labor economics theory which says the optimal formal labor contract is actually the opposite. It's to overpay when you're old and underpay when you're young. And the notion is to get people to want to stick around.




And so in some sense, common labor theory says exactly the opposite of what you suggested. You want to overpay older people to get them to stick around. And for many years in America that's often the way labor markets worked. We had very generous pensions and health benefits and high wages for older workers. That equilibrium is now breaking down because in this more competitive labor market you can't afford to overpay those older workers because then you can't attract the younger workers in the first place. And we're moving towards a flatter profile by age. But that's exactly the set of interesting issues we have to deal with in labor economics in setting pay that we don't really get into here. Other questions or comments on that?




Of course there's another every reason why MIT couldn't do this, which is it's against the law. We have age discrimination laws in our country which say you cannot discriminate against people based purely on their age. MIT could say, well look, I could demonstrate a productivity difference. This guy is publishing fewer articles than he did 20 years ago et cetera, but they do have a legal hurdle to overcome as well as an administrative hurdle.




It would be a pain in the ass for MIT to have to figure out exactly how to shift their wage schedule to do all this. And that causes administrative costs and extra Deans and extra things and they just don't want to deal with it. So there are other barriers as well which is administrative costs and legal costs. But I think probably the main barrier is just the difficult issue of workplace norms and how it affects the productivity of the workers who are behind while you get rid of these older workers or underpay these older workers who aren't as productive. Questions or thoughts on that?


[[Minimum Wage and Employment Rates]]
So now with this monopsony model in mind I want to go back and revisit a major topic that we talked about early in the course. And a couple times in this course we talked about as an example of how governments can screw up markets we talked about the minimum wage. We talked about if you take a competitive labor market and impose a minimum wage above the competitive level, that could lead to deadweight loss. Because what will happen is at that higher wage firms will want fewer workers.




Workers who would be happy to work at the competitive wage will not be able to work. Trades which would make social welfare higher won't be made. And there will be deadweight loss.




The monopsony model says that may not be the case. Because in the monopsony model, a minimum wage can play the same role that optimal price regulation paid with monopolists. Remember with monopolists we said if you regulated a monopolist and forced them to charge a competitive price, that you could actually force them into the competitive outcome.




Well if a minimum wage is set above the prevailing wage but that's because a monopsony prevailing wage is too low, and the minimum wage is set at the competitive level, then you could actually increase employment and improve outcomes with a minimum wage. Sort of counter intuitive. So let's look at it, pretty confusing.




Let's look at figure 18-3. Figure 18-3 once again parallels a figure you saw on the entire flip side for price regulation of a monopolist, this is the parallel which is wage regulation of a monopsonist. Let's walk through this. It's pretty confusing so let's walk through this slowly.




Initially you have a monopsonist who is hiring at the point where their marginal expenditure curve, which is the dashed line and then the solid line. So the line me1 is original marginal expenditure curve. It's the me1 plus the me2, it's that segment. That line which is, once again, more elastic than the supply curve. That intersects the demand curve at a labor supply l1. So they hire l1 workers and they pay a wage w1. That's the initial monopsony equilibrium.




The competitive equilibrium is where supply equals demand. That would be hiring l2 workers and paying a higher wage w2. So the monopsonist is under hiring relative to the competitive firm.

Now let's say the government rolls in and says we're going to set a minimum wage and we're going to happen to get it right and set it at the competitive wage level, w2. Well now let's think about the monopsonist calculus. The monopsonist new marginal expenditure curve is the old one for the solid segment. So where it says me2, that solid segment is still the marginal expenditure curve.




So as they think about hiring additional workers, they're working down that curve. But once they get to l2 workers they can't lower the wage anymore. So that marginal expenditure curve, they can no longer lower the wage below w2. So their new marginal expenditure curve hops down and becomes the minimum wage. So the new marginal expenditure curve is the two segments labeled me2. It's the horizontal segment from the y-axis to e2. And then it jumps up to that upward sloping segment to the right of l2.




So the new marginal expenditure curve is basically at a wage that's above minimum wage they continue to behave like a monopsonist. But once you hit the minimum wage and they can't lower the wage anymore, what happens? The poisoning effect goes away, just like we talked about with the monopolist. Essentially what this has done has killed the poisoning effect. Because it said as you're thinking about hiring that next worker to the right of l1, typically say I want to hire them because I'm going to have to raise my wage to everybody else.




But you're already paying everybody else a higher wage. You're already paying everybody else the minimum wage. So there's no poisoning effect. You're not going to have to pay them a higher wage to hire that next worker because you're already paying them that higher wage.




So just as optimal price regulation undoes the poisoning effect on the demand side, optimal wage regulation undoes that poisoning effect on the supply side and can lead you to the optimal outcome. So minimum wage can actually increase employment. Pretty bizarre. Minimum wage is our whipping boy for this course about how it causes dead weight loss and leads to lower employment.




Here we're saying, actually, if we start a monopsony equilibrium, a minimum wage could increase employment. Of course, as you should know, the minimum wage could reduce employment even in a monopsony setting if it gets set too high. So if the minimum wage got set very high-- Jessica maybe this is something we should actually add for next year-- so if you can imagine a minimum wage that's set very high, that could lead to a level of labor supply that's actually below the monopsony level.

So just as with optimal price regulation, we talked about how setting a price too high can make things worse, setting a minimum wage too high can make things worse. So it's ultimately an empirical question of does the minimum wage raise employment, which would require two conditions, a monopsony market and a well-set minimum wage. Or does it lower employment? Which can happen either with a competitive labor market or it could happen with a poorly-set minimum wage. This pretty confusing so you'll probably have to go home and think more about this. But are there questions now about anything that's not apparent from the diagram?




So now this is why we have empirical economics. We have empirical economics, well really we have two reasons. One, is sometimes we know the direction of what we're looking for, we want measure its magnitude. Sometimes we don't even know the direction, not to mention the magnitude. Here's a case we don't even know the direction. Will increasing the minimum wage raise or lower employment and by how much?




Well how do we test this? Well the traditional way to look at it to say, OK, the minimum wage changes over time, let's look at what happens to employment when the minimum wage goes up. And what people found was an increase in minimum wage tended to be associated with lower employment. When the minimum wage went up, employment fell. So people took that to mean that there was a situation where we're either in a competitive market or we're screwing up the monopsony market by setting too high a minimum wage. Because we raised the minimum wage, employment fell.




And what is wrong with drawing that conclusion from that evidence? Or could someone tell me a story about why that might not be a convincing piece of evidence? Why the fact that when we raise the minimum wage employment falls, why that may not be by itself be compelling. What problem you might have with that piece of evidence. If you read that in the New York Times tomorrow, look at this graph, we raised the wage and employment falls. Clearly minimum wage is bad. What should your first thought be upon reading that article?




Well what do we care about? We care about causation not correlation. So what could be causing this to be correlation but not a causation effect? Someone want to try?




AUDIENCE: It would depend on when you raise the minimum wage. PROFESSOR: Right, in particular what story might cause this effect?



AUDIENCE: If they're in a depression and they decide to raise the minimum wage.




PROFESSOR: Right, what if governments, worried about workers in bad economies, that's exactly when they raise the minimum wage. What if the government raised the minimum wage in bad economy, because that's exactly when they're worried about workers suffering. Then you would see that a higher minimum wage is associated with lower employment. But it's got nothing to do with the higher minimum wage. It's got to do with the fact that you raised the minimum wage when unemployment is falling anyway.




It's causation versus correlation. You have to be critical reader of evidence like this. The minimum wage is not handed down by God. It's determined by legislators who are subject to political pressures which may depend the state of the economy. If the minimum wage increases when employment happens to be falling, then it will look like the minimum wage has harmed employment when it really hasn't.




So what we do about this? What we do about this is to try to think about a way we can find a causal relationship between the minimum wage and employment. And one way to do that is to try to find cases where a minimum wage increased and yet we know there was no independent change in economic activity.




And the way economists have done that is by looking at state minimum wages. Turns out a lot of states actually set minimum wages higher than the national minimum wage. Not really much anymore because the national minimum wage has gone up a lot the last decade. But about a decade ago the national minimum wage, or about 15 years ago, the national minimum wage was at a real historical minimum in real terms. And a lot of states exceeded that in setting their minimum wage.




So take two states, for example New Jersey and Pennsylvania. New Jersey raised its minimum wage, Pennsylvania doesn't. But any economic shock is going to hit New Jersey and Pennsylvania pretty similarly. They're both right next to each other on the East coast. Any recession's going to hit them pretty similarly.

So what you could do is you could ask what happens to employment in New Jersey when they raise their minimum wage relative to Pennsylvania, which suffers the same economic shocks but doesn't raise its minimum wage. We try to achieve the gold standard.




What's the gold standard? The gold standard is a randomized trial. What we'd like is literally a trial where we change the minimum wage randomly at different places and different times. That's ever going to happen. So we try to approximate in what we call a natural experiment or quasi experiment which say, are there experimental interventions that nature gives us, even if they're not perfectly randomized trials. And this is one.




Here's a situation where we have two states, very similar, one raises the minimum wage and one doesn't. And they're set by economic shocks. You can look at that.




Another way people have taken this approach is say, well when the minimum wage increases it's going to have different effects in different places. And why is that? That's because the minimum wage is going to be higher relative to the market wage in some areas than in others.




So, for example, when they raised the minimum wage a dollar nationally, most people in Massachusetts already make more than they raised it to. So it's not going to affect Massachusetts much. Whereas in Mississippi that's a big hit.




So given a national raise we can compare states that were hit harder by that raise to states that were hit less hard, another way to try to do this. A number of studies have done this and they've come up with the striking conclusion that the minimum wage, if anything, raises employment, at least at the levels that we've seen over the last 15,20 years. Changes in the minimum wage are actually associated with modest, but increases in employment. And certainly no decreases. They've been associated with modest increases in employment and not decreases.




And this is really, really striking because this is something that economists just never even really took seriously. We always taught that minimum wage was the bad boy of economics, and this is saying, no, in fact, if you take it seriously and look at the evidence carefully you can actually see that a minimum wage can actually increase employment as this model shows.

Now, this is still the subject of some controversy, there's still a lot of work on it. But it then raises the question of, well how can this really be? Don't we have a pretty competitive labor market? How do we really have a monopsony labor market?




And the answer is that if you look at who's getting the minimum wage it's largely younger and low- skilled workers who don't have a lot of employment options. So basically McDonald's in a given area in a city could have some monopsony power.




Because people don't have cars. These low-income urban youths don't have cars. They can't go somewhere else to work. They don't have skills so they can even work retail because they don't have good enough skills to work retail. So McDonald's has them. McDonald's has some monopsony power over them because McDonald's is a job they can get. Or McDonald's and Burger King together maybe are the jobs they can get. That gives them some monopsony power.




So given that's where the minimum wage is going to bite the most it's maybe not implausible that the minimum wage could actually increase employment which is what we see in the studies. Questions about that? Yeah.




AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] anti-trust would it be possible [INAUDIBLE]




PROFESSOR: Yeah exactly. So let's take my inner city example. McDonald's isn't the only employer. There's Burger King and Wendy's and lots of other low-skilled employers. The notion is if there's a few of them that should be enough to break any monopsony power unless they collude. So likewise just as there's not supposed to be collusion on the output side, there are laws against collusion on the input
side in the same way.




But once again, just as those laws are hard to enforce on the output side they're hard to enforce. Because what you can do is you can get together in the back room, or they can just say, Wendy's and Burger King can wait and see what McDonald's does and just follow in lock step. So there's lots of ways to get around those rules.




But yes, just as there's antitrust laws on the output side, there are the labor market laws on the input side which get in the way of collusion. The difference is those are more on a sector by sector basis. So, for example, the unionization of the workers affects the collusion ability of the employers. So if the workers are unionized it's more lax in terms of allowing employers to collude as well because the workers are colluding. If workers aren't unionized it's less lax. And there's a complicated body of labor law about that. Other questions? Yeah.

AUDIENCE: So it would be bad for unions to try and get an industry-wide standard wage or-- PROFESSOR: Well that's about efficiency versus equity. If a union got an industry-wide standardized wage then that's going to penalize the talented workers who would want to go work elsewhere and help the less talented workers. And basically a lot of the complaints employers have about unions is that they lose their talented workers because the union doesn't allow them to pay those differentials.




Teachers is a great example that's very controversial right now which is, should there be merit pay for teachers. A lot of teachers say, no, there shouldn't be merit pay because that's going to violate workplace norms and it's unfair. But we might not be getting the most talented people into teaching as a result.




So we'll come back next time and we'll start our topics part of the course by talking about international trade and whether it's good or bad. Answer, it's good. But we'll talk about why.
[[Determining Savings Decisions Over Time]]
PROFESSOR: So today we're going to continue our discussion of capital markets. If you remember the introduction from last time, what we talked about was we talked about labor as an input and where it came from. And these lectures are about capitals and input, where it comes from. We talked about the fact that while capital, ultimately, is machines, and buildings, and things like that, what we think about in this course, we're going to think about financial capital and what's behind all the different kinds of
capital that businesses use. We talked about peoples' savings decisions as creating a pool of capital from which businesses draw. And then we talked about present value and the notion of considering the fact that dollars in the future are worth less than dollars today.




So with that as background, what we want to do now is talk about how firms and individuals should make choices over time. We talked a couple of lectures ago about how firms and individuals make choices when faced with uncertainty. So that was sort of a choice across two different states of the world. You could get hit by a car. You could not get hit by a car. Now we'll talk about choices across two different time periods, today versus tomorrow, and how people make those choices.




And the answer is going to be pretty simple following what we did last time, which is whenever you're faced with two choices that pay off at different times, you just want to choose the choice with the highest present value. So if you're faced with two streams of payments, you know that you can't just add them up. What you need to do is you need to add them up in a way that gets present value.




So, for example, consider the example of a professional athlete who's considering two contracts. One contract pays $1 million today, and one contract pays $500,000 today and $2 million in deferred payments in 10 years. So that's the two contract options facing the player.




If you read it in the newspaper, they would describe this is a $2.5 million contract and this as a $1 million contract. However, the newspaper is wrong, because they haven't accounted for the fact that some of those payments are deferred. So they're worth less. 

So how do we compare them? Well, to compare them, we have to take the present value of these two streams. So the present value of the first stream is just $1 million, because it's paid today. So putting it in today's dollars, it's worth $1 million.




The second stream is worth, the present value is $500,000 plus $2 million over 1 plus i to the 10th, because it's being paid in 10 years. And actually here, I'm going to not use i. I'm going to use r for the
real interest rate. Remember  last time we talked about how what really matters is the real interest rate, the interest rate you get minus inflation, minus the costs of price increases for goods you have to buy with that interest. So remember we want to use the real interest rate here. So I'll use r now.




So, basically, whether this second contract is a better deal or not depends on what the real interest rate is. So if r equals 5%, then the present value of this second contract is $1.73 million. So that is a good deal. On the other hand, if r equalled 20%, if there's a 20% interest rate as there was back in the late
'70s, early '80s, then the present value is $0.82 million. So it's not a good deal.




So the key is if you want to ever compare two streams of payments that pay off in different times, you have to bring them back to a comparable unit, to today's dollars. And the way we do that is by calculating their present value. And this is a problem people have. A common mistake that's made is people don't consider this in evaluating streams of payments.




So a classic example is when you hear someone wins $100 million in the lottery. It's actually a lot less than that. Because $100 million lottery win, what it really is is $5 million a year for 20 years. And you have a choice. You could take a lump sum now, or you take the $5 million a year over 20 years.




So basically, the $5 million a year over 20 years is, of course, worth a lot less than $100 million. What's it worth? Well, it's worth $5 million plus $5 million over 1 plus the real interest rate plus $5 million over 1 plus the real interest rates squared plus dot dot dot dot plus $5 million over 1 plus the real interest rate to the 20th.




So, for example, for an interest rate of 5%, if r equals 5%, this lottery is really worth $65 million. Now, that's still pretty good. But it's a lot less than $100 million. When you hear a number about a player's contract or a lottery winning, you need to always recognize that the effective value is going to be lower than what you hear on the news because of the time payment that takes place. Now whether that's a big deal or not depends on the interest rate.




So Victor Martinez just signed with the Detroit Tigers for four years and $50 million. Now, he could have signed with the Chicago White Sox for three years and $42 million. Or the Boston Red Sox were offering. So the Chicago White Sox were offering three years and $42 million.




Now, you might say that you can't really compare those two, because one is out three years, and one is out four years. But the truth is the interest rate right now is so low that you can pretty much compare them. Right now, the interest rate you can get in a bank is close to 0. So, basically, if the interest rate is
0, the present value is the nominal value. So right now, you can sort of compare players' contracts like that.




On the other hand, when the interest rate is higher, you can't do that comparison. And, in particular, what you'll hear a lot of times is these contracts have very deferred payments. So even for a low interest rate, it's still worth a lot less in the end. So that's the key point to remember when you hear values. It's
to know that you have to discount them by when they happen. And that's going to depend on how high the interest rate is.



[[Investment Decisions and Net Present Value]]
Now, this leads us directly to the important implication of present value which is how firms and individuals make investment decisions. So we've talked about firms choosing a level of capital and a level of labor. And we talked about in a simple isoquant-isocost framework. But, in reality, firms don't really deal with that simple framework. In reality, for any given investment decision, they essentially want to compare the cost of that investment to the benefits of that investment. And that depends on things like the isoquants and the isocosts. But it also depends critically on the time frame over which that investment will pay out.




And what firms consider when they make an investment decision is the net present value of that decision. On net, what's the present value? Because often, for the investment decisions, you have to lay out money up front to recoup that money later on. So this adds an extra dimension. Which is not just you're adding up a stream of future payments. You're actually contrasting a debit now versus credits in the future. And the math is the same, but it's a little bit more complicated. So the net present value of any investment is going to be the revenues from that investment in period 0 minus the cost of that investment in period 0 plus the revenues from that investment in the period 1 minus the cost of that investment in period 1 over 1 plus r plus dot dot dot dot dot plus the revenues in year t minus the costs in year t over 1 plus r to the t. So the net present value is going to be a function of at every year is the investment making or losing money and then adding those future gains or losses up discounting by when they occur.




And the bottom line is firm investment decisions are very simple. If this is greater than 0, then it's a good investment. If it's less than 0, it's not. And this matters a lot, because you'll often see investments that have cash losses up front and gains later. In fact, that's sort of the definition of investment. It's that you're investing some money up front to yield returns later on.




So, for example, if you have an investment with an upfront cost of $100 in year 1, it's going to cost you $100 in year 1 to buy some machine, and you get no revenues. So it's minus $100 in year 1. But in year 2, you're going to earn $200 from that machine minus you're going to have a $50 maintenance on the machine, so $150 in year 2.




So in year 1, you buy the machine for $100. In year 2, the machine produces some widgets which you can sell for $200. But, along the way, you have to maintain that machine. And that costs you $50 in year
2. The net present value is minus $100 plus $150 over 1 plus r. That's the net present value. Whether that's positive or not is going to depend critically on what the interest rate is. So the key thing is we want to take that stream of payments, positive or negative, and put them in today's terms. Are there questions about that?




But this raises the question of well, what interest rates should a firm use? So the firm has got to make this decision. Should all firms just walk by BayBank, or Fleet Bank, or whatever the hell it's called now? What is the big bank called? Fleet, I guess. Should they walk by now and look in the window and say the interest rate is 1%, or 2%, 3% and use that? What should firms do?




Basically, the key issue is that different firms will have different interest rates that they want to use. Or firms will have different, what we call, discount rates. You can have a firm-specific discount rate. You can have a firm-specific discount rate that firms might want to use. And what's going to determine that is going to be the opportunity cost of money to the firm. What is the firm's next best use of that money they're investing. 

So, for example, let's say a firm has a bunch of cash sitting around. Let's say the firm has $100 in cash sitting around, and it's trying to decide whether or not to make this investment. How do we decide on what the opportunity cost on that investment is, what the right discount rate is to use? How should the firm think about that? If it's got the cash sitting around, how should the firm think about whether it should invest $100? Yeah.




AUDIENCE: Well, whether or not it has some other place that it can invest it. Or it's just going to rot in a safe somewhere.




PROFESSOR: Well, at a minimum, we can put it in the bank. So at a minimum, it can always earn 1% or
2% of whatever banks are paying now. But what you're saying is right. It may also have other investment opportunities. So, in some sense, the discount rate for any investment opportunity is what you could earn on the next best investment opportunity.




So if I've got $100 sitting around, and I've got a guaranteed 10% I can make somewhere, then if I decide whether or not I should take this investment, I should use a discount rate of 10%. If I can make 20% somewhere, I should use 20%. So, in some sense, what you want to do is you want to stack up your investment opportunities from worst to best in terms of rate of return. And then you start at the top of the list and ask, OK, discounting at the best alternative opportunity, is this one worth it given the steam of payments? And then work your way down the list. So, basically, the key thing is that for any firm, their opportunity cost, their discount rate is the next best thing they could have done with the money.




Similarly, if a firm doesn't have the money and is deciding whether or not to borrow the money to do this investment, then the discount will be the cost of borrowing the money. Right now the bank only pays 1% on your money. But if you want a loan, you still have to pay 4% for it.




So it may be that you could end up in a situation where your $100 doesn't really do you that much good saved. And it would cost so much to borrow the $100, that it's better to use the $100 that's sitting around. So, basically, let's say you have $100 sitting around, and you're trying to decide how to finance its investment. Well let's say you have an alternative investment that yields 10%. What you do is you put the $100 on the alternative. And then you say, well, should I then borrow to finance this investment? Well, I have to ask, is the borrowing rate low enough that this net present value is positive? So the firm wants to consider all of its options it can do with its money that it's borrowing and consider a discount rate for each, which is the alternative next best use of the money.




Now it's not just firms that make these investment decisions. People have to make these decisions too. In fact, I faced one, a number of years ago, when I was first teaching this course. So it's good for me to work it out in the context. I was decided this just about the time I was delivering this lecture. And here was my choice. Basically, I had to decide on whether to invest in insulation for my 100-year-old house. I've got this old house, windy, crappy, whatever, and I had to decide whether to invest in insulation.




And the math was that my heating bills were costing me $2,000 a year. I was spending $2,000 a year in heat. It's a lot more now. Back then it was $2,000 a year. My best estimate was that if I insulated my house, I could lower my heating costs by about 25%, or about minus $500 per year. But to do that insulation would cost $4,000.




So my question was, do I make a $4,000 investment to lower my heating costs by $500 a year? Well, I know how to do that. I say, I take my $4,000, that's a negative in year 1. So let's say there's no effect in year 1 of the heating costs, because they're putting it in. So the heating savings start in year 2.




So then in year 2 I'm going to save $500. But that I'm going to have to discount at some interest rate. In year 3, I'm going to save another $500. I'll discount that at some interest rate, and so on.




Now, the tricky thing about this calculation is twofold. What are the two things I still have to figure out to do this calculation? Yeah.

AUDIENCE: The time frame that you're going to spend in the house and the interest rate. PROFESSOR: One is the interest rate. Now, for that one, I have to think well, if I had money sittingaround, what was the next best investment opportunity. This was the early 2000s when the stockmarket didn't look like a very good investment opportunity. The next best was the interest rates were probably on the order of about 5% back then. So let's say I could have put it in the bank at 5%. 

But the other tricky thing is how long will I have the house for? If I'm going to own the house forever, or for long enough that it's equivalent to forever, then I know I can just rewrite this as minus $4,000 plus $500 over r. So if the interest rate was 5%, then that's minus $4,000 plus $500 over 5% or plus $10,000which is well above 0.

So at a 5% interest rate, if I was going to own the house forever, this is a great investment. Yeah. AUDIENCE: Wouldn't you also have to consider how much it would add to the value of your house when you attempt to sell it?




PROFESSOR: Excellent point. Even if I'm not going own the house forever, it still might be a good investment. Let's say I was going to sell the house in two years, then it would be minus $4,000 plus $500 over 1.05-- Well, let's say I was going to sell it after two years. So this is the first year and the second year. So you might say, well, this is clearly a bad deal. I'm spending $4,000, and all I'm saving is $500.
And that's in this future where it's worth less.




But then the question is, how much does it raise the value of my house? In a perfect world, given that my house will live on forever, it should raise the value of my house by $10,000. Because what I've done is I've saved $500 forever. So whoever buys it after me should be willing to pay $10,000 more for it.




But the question is that information, will that percolate down? Will people actually include that in the value? So in some sense, the decision I had to make was, will I live there long enough that even if the next people don't value it, I'll still end up having the positive net present value. If I lived there for more than about 10 or 12 years, that would be true.




And the second thing is if I'm going to live there less than that, will the price go up enough that the net present value will be positive? I decided to do it. I've been there at least 10 years since. So it was a good decision. But this is exactly how consumers face these kinds of decisions every day. Just as uncertainty affects decision making of people every day, so does thinking about streams of payments over time. Yeah. AUDIENCE: Did you leave out the square on the $500 over 1+r? PROFESSOR: Yeah. You're right. Good point.

[[Application of Investment Decisions: Human Capital]]
OK. so now another very interesting application of this that may be more relevant to you. You guys aren't thinking about insulating your houses right now. But your family has recently thought about a very important decision. It's not about investing in physical capital, like investing a machine, but investing in your human capital.




An important theory due to Gary Becker, Nobel Prize winning economist at Chicago, was that just as we can think of firms buying machines as investing in physical capital, we think of people investing in education as like building your human capital. You're spending money to improve your long run productivity just like buying a machine improves the firm's long run opportunity. So it's exactly the same thing. It's just instead of investing in a building or a machine, we invest in you. And, likewise, human capital investment decisions are subject to the same net present value considerations that physical capital production decisions are subject to.




Let's think about this with an example from the book. So imagine that if you don't go to college, you're going to work for age 18 to age 70. And if you do go to college, you work from age 22 to age 70. You get the extra year dinking around Europe or whatever. No, that's right, 18 to 22, four years.




So you either work from 18 to 70 if you don't go to college or 22 to 70 if you do go to college. Imagine, moreover, that college costs $10,000 a year, obviously not MIT. Some state school, $10,000 a year is what college is going to cost. And the cost of going to college is twofold. One is you pay the $10,000 a year. Second, you forgo earning while you're in college.




The benefit of going to college is you learn a lot more once you graduate. On average, at age 22, the typical college educated person-- once again, not MIT-- but the typical college educated person earned about $30,000 while someone with a high school diploma only earned about $20,000. So you earn a lot more thereafter. So, basically, the trade-off is you pay tuition up front, and you lose earnings up front, but you earn a lot more starting at age 22. Well, how do we think about whether that's a good investment or not. Well, let's look at Figure 22-1, the present value of education.




What you see is a diagram of the net present value calculation. So from age 18 to 22 there's a huge cost, which is your forgone earnings plus the amount that you had to pay to go. Then starting at age 22, there's a net benefit, which is you earn more. Basically, whether the net present value is positive depends on comparing the shape of these and discounting the fact that the earnings you make from going to college are worth a lot less.




So what's striking here is that basically if the discount rate is more than 5.1%, it turns out not to make sense to go to college. It's pretty amazing, if you think about it. You earn 50% more if you go to college, 50% more. And yet if the discount rate is more than 5.1%, which it's been, typically, in many years in our society, it's going to end up not making sense to go to college. Why? Because the upfront costs are worth so much more. The upfront benefits of excluding college are now. And the benefits of your education are distant. So, as a result, because of net present value considerations, unless the discount rate is very low, it's not going to make sense to go to college.




It turns out now, of course, the discount rate is very low. Now we ask ourselves, OK, what is the discount rate your parents face when they decide whether to send you to college? Or maybe you faced it? Maybe you're paying for your own college. What's the discount rate you face? Well, once again, it's the opportunity cost of the money you use to go to college and the opportunity cost of what you could have done with the money you made if you were working now at gap.




The opportunity cost of the money you could have made, is you could have saved that at some interest rate. But the truth is whatever you could have saved it at, nothing is yielding much more than 0 right now. There's no investment that yields anything. So the interest rate is very low on that savings.




Moreover, you had to borrow the $10,000 a year and, in your case, the $50,000 a year, to come to college. And that's at the borrowing rate which is still above 5% even in this economy. Yeah.




AUDIENCE: Can you explain to me what the discount rate is. PROFESSOR: Oh, the discount rate is the interest rate in this net present value calculation. So when you're considering whether to go to college, it's the rate at which you discount those future extra earnings that you're going to get. So the discount rate is your version of the interest rate. It's the opportunity cost, the opportunity cost to you of what you could have done with that money.




What you could have done with the savings from working is basically nothing. It would have just sat under your mattress. However, the money you had to borrow to come to college, that you paid 7%, 8%. That's money that has a pretty high discount rate. That's money that's worth a lot less in the future.




So at the end of the day, with today's interest rates, it almost certainly makes sense to go to college. However, when interest rates are high, it might not. And that's an argument for why the government may want to subsidize student loans. The government is in the business of subsidizing student loans and making student loans artificially cheap. That's a pretty big government expenditure. It's on the order of
$30 billion a year.




Why is the government doing that? Well, this table tells you why. If the government thinks that there's social benefits for having a more highly educated population, then, essentially, by intervening to lower the discount rate through subsidizing college loans, the government can encourage people to go to college. OK. Questions about that? So that's how we think about net present value in investment decisions which is basically to put everything in today's dollars and then, on net, ask if it's positive or negative.



[[The Importance of Savings]]
Now, the other thing I want to talk about, in terms of government policy, and in terms of important issues in this area, is about increasing savings. I want to talk about increasing savings in the US. Why do we care about increasing savings in the US? Why do we care about that as a goal? After all, I said savings is a bad. Consumption is the good. Why do we care about savings?




Well, the fact is the US government does. The US government spends hundreds of billions of dollars a year encouraging individuals to save in ways I'll describe in a moment. Why do they do that?




Well, the reason they do that is because savings becomes the engine for growth in our economy. Basically, as savings goes up, that increases the pool of capital available for firms to draw from. In other words, that shifts out the capital market supply curve. In terms of the diagram that we made last time of the capital market, that shifts out the capital market supply curve or increases that pool of capital. 

As the capital market supply curve shifts out, what happens to the interest rate? It falls. That leads the real interest rate to fall. Because there's a bigger pool. It's cheaper to get from it. As a pool grows, it's cheaper to draw from it. That lowers the interest rate.




What does a lower interest rate mean for any given investment to its net present value? It means it's higher. In means that any given investment has a higher net present value now. Because a lower interest rate means you might as well invest instead of just putting the money off to the future. And a higher net present value means more investment.




So more savings becomes the engine of growth for our economy. Because savings promotes investment. When people save, it lowers the price of borrowing. Firms are more likely to borrow, and they invest more. And so that's why savings is so important. And this is basically a lot of what Bob Solow won his Nobel Prize for. A famous professor from MIT won his Nobel Prize for pointing out the critical role in savings is an engine of growth. It's that basically savings becomes the key engine to growth. And as a result, society should care about how much individuals save, not just how much they consume. And that's why savings is so important.




The problem is we don't save a whole lot in the US. In China, for example, the savings rate, depending on how it's measured, is on the order of 30%. So for every dollar people earn in China, they save about
$0.30. In the US, it's about 3%. For every dollar we earn, we save about $0.03. It was negative for a while. Yeah.




AUDIENCE: Are those rates including taxes and other things that people have to pay. So is it like revenue?




PROFESSOR: Its a share of your disposable income you save. The check you take home, how much of it do you save, and how much of it do you spend? US citizens spend about $0.97 on every dollar we take home. Chinese citizens spend about $0.70 on every dollar they take home.




You might have noticed that China's grown a hell of a lot faster than the US over the last 30 years. It's no coincidence. They're basically building up a stock of capital that's allowing their firms to draw on it at a cheap rate and invest. And that's why something like 20% of all the world's cranes are in Shanghai right now. Because they have a huge pool of capital they can drawn to build all of those new buildings and invest.
