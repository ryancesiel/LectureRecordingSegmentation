PROFESSOR: So what I want to do today is I want to talk about what the heck this course is. What is microeconomics? What are you going to be learning in this course? And just, sort of, set us up for the semester. OK. So basically, microeconomics is all about scarcity. It's all about how individuals and firms make decisions given that we live in a world of scarcity. Scarcity is key because basically what we're going to learn about this semester in various shapes and forms is a lot of different types of constrained optimization. We're going to learn a lot about different ways that individuals make choices in a world of scarcity. OK?


That is, this course is going to be about trade-offs. Given scarce resources, how the individuals and firms trade off different alternatives to make themselves as well-off as possible. That's why economics is called the dismal science. OK? It's called the dismal science because we are not about everyone have everything. We're always the people who say, no, you can't have everything. You have to make a trade- off. OK? You have to give up x to get y. And that's why people don't like us. OK? Because that's why we're called the dismal science, because we're always pointing out the trade-offs that people face.


Now, some may call it dismal, but I call it fun. And that may be because of my MIT training, as I said I was an undergraduate here. In fact, MIT is the perfect place to teach microeconomics because this whole institute is about engineering solutions which are really ultimately about constrained optimization. Indeed, what's the best example in the world we have of this? It's the 270 contest. Right? You're given a pile of junk, you've got to build something that does something else. That's an exercise in constrained optimization.


All engineering is really constrained optimization. How do you take the resources you're given and do the best job building something. And that's really what microeconomics is. Just like 270 is not a dismal contest, microeconomics is not to me a dismal science. You could think of this course like 270. But instead of the building robots, we're running people's lives. OK? That's, kind of, the way I like to think about this course. Instead of trying to decide how we can build something to move a ping pong ball across a table, we're trying to decide how people make their decisions to consume, and firms make their decisions to produce. That's basically what's going to go on in this class.


OK? And that's why basically modern microeconomics was founded at MIT in the 1950s by Paul Samuelson. The father of modern economics was a professor here, and he basically founded the field. He basically introduced mathematics to economics. And through teaching this course, 14.01, 50, 60 years ago, actually developed the field that we now study.


Now, what we're going to do in this class, is focused on two types of actors in the economy: consumers and producers. OK? And we are going to build models of how consumers and producers behave. Now, technically, a model is going to be a description of any relationship between two or more economic variables. OK? That's a model. A description of any relationship between two or more economic variables.


The trick with economics, and the reason many of you will be frustrated during the semester, is that unlike the modern relationship between say energy and mass these models are never precise. They are never accurate to the 10th decimal. OK? This is not a precise, scientific relationship with modeling. We'll be making a number of simplifying assumptions that allow us to capture the main tendencies in the data. That allow us to capture the main insights into how individuals make consumption decisions and how firms make production decisions. But it's not going to be as clean and precise as the kind of proofs you're going to be doing in some of your other classes in freshman and sophomore year. OK?


So basically, we have a trade off with the simplifying assumptions. On the one hand, obviously we want a model that can explain reality as much as possible. If a model can't explain reality, it's not useful. On the other hand, we need a model that's tractable, a model that I can teach you in a lecture or less. OK? And basically, what we do is we make a lot of simplifying assumptions in this class to make those models work. And yet, what we'll find is despite these assumptions, we'll come up with incredibly powerful predictions of how consumers and producers behave.


So with consumers what we're going to do is, we're going to say that consumers are constrained by their limited wealth or what we'll call their budget constraint. And subject to that constraint they choose the set of goods that makes them as well off as possible. OK? That's what we're going to call utility maximization. We'll say the consumers maximize their utility, consumers are going to maximize utility subject to a budget constraint. That's going to be what we're going to develop the consumer decision.
They have some utility function which is going to be a model of their preferences. OK?
So I'm going to propose to take everything you love in life and write it down as a u function. OK? Then I'm going to propose you take all the resources at your disposal, write them down as a budget constraint and then I just do constrained maximization to solve for how you make decisions. Firms, on the other hand, are going to maximize profits. Pi is profits. Firms are going to maximize profits. Their goal is to make as much profit as possible, to earn as much money as possible. OK? However, that's going to be subject to both the demands of consumers, we get to firms it's a lot harder, subject to both consumer demand and input costs.


So firms have to consider, consumers have to consider look what does stuff cost and what do I like, I'll make my decision. Firms is a little more complicated. They've go to consider, what do consumers want and how do I make what they want? So they've got to consider both the output side, what a consumer is going to want me to make and what's it going to cost me to produce that good? And how do I combine those to make the most profits? OK?


So from these assumptions, we will be able to answer the three fundamental questions of microeconomics. OK? The three fundamental questions of microeconomics will be, what goods and services should be produced? What goods and services should be produced? How to produce those goods and services? And who gets the goods and services? What goods and services get produced? How to produce those goods and services? And who gets them? And what's amazing, we'll learn in this course, is that all three of these questions, the three fundamental questions that drive our entire economy, are all solved through the role of one key state variable, which is prices.


Prices in the economy resolve all of these problems. OK? Consumers and firms will interact in a market, they'll interact in a marketplace. And out of that marketplace will emerge a set of prices, in a way we'll describe. And those prices will allow firms and consumers to make the relevant decisions. OK?

[[The Role of Prices: Examples]
So let me just give you one, and we're going to do all this rigorously throughout the semester, let me just start with one casual example. OK? Let's think about the development of the iPod. OK? Let's cast our minds way back, lo way back to the development of the iPod. OK? Now, when Apple was thinking about making the iPod, they had to ask, would consumers want this? So consumers had to decide given their limited resources, given the fact that they were buying a certain set of things would they be willing to forsake some things they were already doing to spend the money on the iPod? OK?


It was a non-trivial amount of money. Would they be willing to forsake things they are already doing? OK? To spend money on the iPod. And clearly they were. Clearly, consumers were willing to spend
money, to spend a lot of money, to get an iPod. They were originally what? $300 Back when $300 meant something. OK. So basically, what the firm will do is they'll say, OK, we get a signal from the consumer that they're willing to pay money to get the iPod. They're willing to pay a high price to get the iPod.


Now, the firm will say, well, should we make iPods? Well, that will depend on what it cost to make them. So we have to then assess what are the inputs that we'll need to make an iPod? Well, to do that we have to look at the prices of the various inputs that we'll need, of the chip in them and the metal and all the other stuff that goes into the iPod. OK? So they can shop across different countries, to different kinds of chips, they can look at different kinds of monitors, et cetera.


But, once again, what they'll do is they'll use the prices of those different inputs to decide how to produce the iPod. So whether to produce the iPod will depend on the price people are willing to pay for it. How to make the iPod will depend on the prices that firms have to pay for the chip and the casing and all the other things that go into the iPod. OK? And then finally, who's going to get the iPod? Well, they're going to make a certain amount. What decided who gets them? Well, the person who gets them are the people who are willing to pay the price that Apple decides to charge. Some people are willing to pay that price, they're going to get an iPod. Some people are not willing to pay that price, they will not get an iPod. So the price in the market will ultimately decide who gets the iPod, as well. OK?


So basically, prices will determine what gets produced, how it's produced, and who gets the goods that are produced. OK? Of course, this is a very, very simplified example, as you can already tell. There are lots of cases where prices don't decide these things. So my favorite example is the fact that there are lines for hours to get tickets to see a Lady Gaga concert. OK? Now if it's really true that prices determine everything, we shouldn't see any lines. It should just be that those who are willing to pay the most to see Lady Gaga should. Those who want the most to get Lady Gaga should get the tickets. Those who aren't willing to pay shouldn't get the tickets. Why should there be a line? Not to mention the fact that people shouldn't be willing to pay anything, but that's a different issue. That's a taste issue. We'll come to taste later. OK?


So basically, clearly this is not working perfectly. If the world worked in the way I just described, then what should happen is there should be essentially an auction and whoever is willing to pay the most for Lady Gaga tickets would get them. And whoever is not willing to pay wouldn't. It wouldn't involve any waiting in line or other things. Now, what's very interesting is we've actually seen an evolution from my youth to your youth towards the economic model.
When I was a kid, if you wanted, so then it was Cars tickets, OK, to date myself, OK, you had to go and camp out at 3:00 in the morning outside the store where they're selling them to get the tickets. Now, of course, you don't do that anymore. Now you go on Stub Hub or Ticketmaster or these other secondary sellers and there there are prices that determine it. So how many people have waited on line to get a concert ticket? That's amazing. So if I asked this question 30 years ago, 90% of the hands would have gone up. OK?


So what that means is the price mechanism has started to be used. It has replaced the line mechanism as a way to allocate those tickets. And we see prices working. That wasn't true. There wasn't StubHub. There weren't these secondary ticket sellers 30 years ago. You had to wait on line to get the tickets.

[[Important Distinctions in Economics]
Now, so that's basically, sort of, an overview about, sort of an example, of how we think about the role of prices. Now, let me draw a couple of important distinctions, terms I'm going to use this semester that I want you to be comfortable with. OK? The first distinction I want to draw is between theoretical versus empirical economics. Theoretical versus empirical economics. OK. Theoretical economics is the process of building models to explain the world. OK? Empirical economics is the process of testing those models to see how good a job they do in explaining the world. OK?


We could all make up a model. OK? Anybody with math skills could make up a model. But it doesn't do any good unless it's actually doing something to explain the world. And so basically, the goal of theoretical economics is essentially to build a model that has some testable predictions. To build a model that says, look here's my simplified model of how consumers decide whether or not to buy an iPod. OK? I have a model of that, that I've built theoretically. Well, that has some testable predictions. And the role of empirical economics is to gather the data and go and test them using statistical methods. Specifically, typically regression analysis like the kind you learn about in advanced statistics. OK?


So basically, what we're going to do is we're going to is 95% of this course will be about theoretical economics this semester. It will be about understanding how economists develop the models to model how consumers and firms behave. But I will try to talk somewhat about empirical economics and what data we can bring to bear to understand whether or not these models explain the world. OK?


The other distinction that's very important is positive versus normative economics. Positive versus normative economics. And this is the distinction between the way things are, which is positive economics, and the way things should be which is normative economics. Distinction between the way things are and the way things should be. OK? So let's consider a great example of microeconomics at
work which is auctions on eBay. OK? Auctions on eBay, economists love studying auctions on eBay because it's a textbook example of what we call a perfectly competitive market which is what we'll focus on the semester. A perfectly competitive market. OK?


And by that we mean that basically that producers in this market offer up their good to a wide range of consumers. OK? A number of producers offer up their goods to a wide range of consumers. OK? And the consumers bid up the price until the person who has the highest value for the good gets it. So price serves exactly the signal it should in allocating goods. OK? So really eBay's really sort of about this third thing of who gets the good. OK?

[[Positive vs. Normative Analysis of the eBay Kidney Auction]
I offer my alarm clock or whatever on eBay, OK, and then people bid on that. And whoever values that the most, that rare Jon Gruber alarm clock the most, they get it. OK? So it's a perfect textbook example. OK? And basically, because on eBay the price is used, or now with also StubHub and concert tickets, the price is used to allocate the good to the person who wants it the most. OK? Now, a recent example of an auction on eBay that a lot of attention, not so recent anymore a couple years ago, someone tried to auction their kidney on eBay. OK?


Someone offered their kidney for auction on eBay and said, I have two kidneys I only need one. So I'm going to auction my kidney, you pay for me to fly to wherever you need my kidney and the operation, they take it out and they give it to you. And that's the way it goes. So what happened was person offered their kidney and they said the starting price will be $25,000. They didn't do a buy it now. They said the starting price will be $25,000 and the bidding went on. The price got to $5 million before eBay shot it down. eBay shut the auction down. And eBay said no, in fact, you can't do this.


Now there's two questions here. The first is, why did the price of the kidney go so high? That's the positive question. The positive question is, why did the price the kidney on eBay get so high? And here, we'll talk, and you'll learn more starting Friday, about the twin forces of supply and demand. The twin forces that drive the economy of supply and demand. And you'll talk more rigorously about these on Friday. Basically, they're what they sound like. Demand is how much someone wants something. Supply is how much of it there is to have.


And the intuition here is surprising. OK? The more that there's demand for a good, the higher will be the upward pressure on prices. The more people want a good, the higher prices will go. And the less supply there is of a good, also the higher prices will go. So if everybody wants something but it's common, the price will be low. And if no one wants something but it's uncommon, the price will still be low, and vice
versa. In fact, the development of the model of supply and demand framework was from Adam Smith, the, sort of, so-called first economist who wrote The Wealth of Nations in 1776 which is, sort of, viewed as the, kind of, first serious book about economics.


And he posed what he called the water diamond paradox. What Smith said in that book is, look, it's clear water is the most important thing in life. We can't live without water. And diamonds are completely irrelevant to life. You can live totally fine without a diamond. And yet, the price of diamonds is astronomical and water's free. How can this be? How can it be that water which is so much more of a fundamental building block of our life is so much cheaper than diamonds which are not. And the answer, of course, is that so far you've only considered demand and not supply.


Yes, it's true. The demand for water is much higher than the demand for diamonds. But the supply is even larger. So that basically, yes it's true that while water should be worth more, in fact, in the end the price of water is much lower, because of the twin forces of demand and supply. The demand is higher, but the supply is much higher. So the price ends up lower. And that was his diamond water paradox.
OK?



Well, in this case, it's a similar thing. What determines the demand for a kidney? What determines the demand for a kidney is going to be the fact that you die without it. OK? If you have no kidneys, you're having kidney failure. OK? You'll die without it. So basically, what will determine it is people are willing to spend all their wealth, as much money as they can have, to get a kidney OK? So the demand will be quite high. The supply will be quite low.


Sadly, not many people are willing to be organ donors. More relevantly, a lot of people aren't in good situations to be organ donors. OK? As a result, the supply is much lower than the demand. So we have a situation with a high demand, a low supply and the price went through the roof. That's a positive analysis. OK? So we can understand pretty intuitively. We don't need this course to understand why the price went up. OK? It's just the twin powers of demand and supply.


But what about the normative question which is, should eBay have allowed this sale to happen? EBay at
$5 million cut it off and then passed the rule saying you can't auction your body parts on eBay. OK? Should they have done that? That's the normative question. That's economics gets really interesting, which is you all are smart enough to figure out why the price went up. But this is where it gets interesting is should people have been able to auction their kidney on eBay?


On the one hand, many, many people in this country die for want of a body part. OK? Thousands to hundreds of thousands of people die every year waiting for a transplant. OK? If someone is incredibly rich and they want a body part, which to me a surplus because I have two kidneys, why shouldn't they be allowed to buy it from me? I'm better off because they can pay me a ton of money. They are better off because they live. So I've just described a transaction that makes both parties better off. Why shouldn't that be allowed to happen? So you tell me. Does everyone think eBay was wrong? Yeah, go ahead.


AUDIENCE: Say there is another person who doesn't have as much money, and that person also dies.



PROFESSOR: You mean the person who, what do you mean the person doesn't have as much-



AUDIENCE: --so obviously somebody doesn't get the kidney.



PROFESSOR: So in other words, what you're assuming is, let's say that if I hadn't done the auction on eBay, I would have just given my kidney away to the transplant center. Then that's one less kidney that can go to the transplant center. And that means the rich guy gets the kidney, and someone else implicitly doesn't. That's a trade-off. You've just described a trade-off. The trade-off is that basically now we've allocated the kidney away from the poor person to the rich person. Now, but why do we care about that? I mean one person dies, another person lives, why do we care? Yeah?


AUDIENCE: There would be some sort of case of severity in condition. Like there might be someone who's poor who would get the kidney if it went to a transplant association because they would die in a couple of days without it. Whereas the rich person might just be able to afford it, and it might make their life more convenient. But they might not be in any more peril.


PROFESSOR: They might be a collector. So basically, that's right. So one reason we might care is because we think that kidneys should be allocated on the basis of who needs it the most. OK? So a great example of this, of course, was Mickey Mantle with a liver transplant. Mickey Mantle, famous ballplayer, raging alcoholic, who had liver failure because he was basically drinking himself to death, and jumped the queue and got a liver above a bunch, a lot of people and then he kept drinking and killed himself and wasted the liver he'd gotten. OK?


So basically, you can think that doesn't make sense. We should give it to people who need it the most. For who it would do the most good in terms of increasing their life. OK. So we've got the substitution point. OK. Let's come back to the substitution point though. Tell me a situation in which that's wrong. Can someone tell me a situation in which, in fact, that not a valid point. Yeah.


AUDIENCE: Well, if the guy is only going to sell it. He's not going to give it away.



PROFESSOR: Exactly. You're assuming that the guy who did sell would give it away. But, in fact, if it's sell it or keep it then there's no trade-off. And similar here, if it's sell it or keep it then you might as well let the rich guy get it. Or is there another argument? Is there another reason why you might not want this to happen? Yeah.


AUDIENCE: It would encourage people to use illegal ways of getting kidneys.



PROFESSOR: So the other reason could be that we don't trust people to make good decisions when money's involved. That we think that, gee, if it's really true I can get a couple million bucks for a kidney, I might give mine up even if I haven't really thought through the ramifications of doing so. Even if there's a risk to the surgery, if there's a risk that my other kidney will then fail then I'll be screwed. OK? So basically, we might have a paternalistic attitude that will lead us to not want to allow people to engage in this kind of risky behavior. Yeah?


AUDIENCE: There may also be some legal ramifications associated with that if someone sells their kidney and then their other kidney fails, they might then blame eBay.


PROFESSOR: Want it back. Like that Repo movie.



That's right. There could, but let's leave the lawyers out of this, OK? I don't like lawyers. I'm going to rag on lawyers this semester. We're going leave the lawyers out of this. But, in any case, you're right. That's, sort of, a ramification of the same thing. So we've talked about the fact that there's substitution. We've talked about the fact that it's not allocated to those who need it the most. We've talked about the fact that people might be making bad decisions in doing this.


But there's another factor, as well, which is we may just as a society feel it's unfair that rich people can get things poor people can't. There may be a pure equity component here. OK? Which is simply that we as a society value equality, value income inequality. And we think people should not have an extra shot at getting a resource just because they're rich. Now that is a very deep and hard concept, and we'll spend a couple lectures talking about equity towards the end of the semester. By and large, we won't consider it. OK?


But it turns out to be behind much of what we'll discuss, OK, in much of what we'll discuss this semester and much of what goes on in economics. OK? Just take a look at the debate that's going on right now in terms of President Obama trying to decide whether or not to extend tax cuts to wealthy individuals in the US. Some people argue that allowing those tax cuts would promote the economy. OK? But others argue it's unfair for rich people to get tax breaks. And that fairness argument matters a lot in terms of driving the kind of economic policy decisions we need to make.

[[Everyday Applications of Economics]
So this semester, we're going to focus a lot on efficiency and optimization and how to get resources to the right place. But you have to remember behind a lot of this is deep normative issues about what should be happening, how should an economy function, and, in particular, how should we think about these kind of equity issues that are so important. OK. The last thing I want to talk about is I want to talk about why micro is not just an abstract concept for things like you might say, oh this is all pretty funny and it's like selling kidneys on eBay and tax cuts for the rich and why do I care? OK?


Well, you care because literally every decision you make is made through the kind of framework we're going to think about this semester. OK? Now, different decisions may follow our models more closely and less closely. But there is not an economic decision. OK? Sorry, let me back up. There's not a decision that people have made that economists haven't tried to model. From whether to produce iPods, to how many times to have sex each week. OK? These are all things economists have tried to model with varying degrees of success. OK?


Because economists think that these all come from the same decision theoretic framework that we can discuss. Let's talk about a simple example from this course. Your decision of whether or not to buy the textbook. There's a textbook and what's it cost? $140? What's it cost? Does anyone know?


AUDIENCE: This line says $180. And this one says $180, but it's available for $130.


PROFESSOR: $130, fine. So $130 for Professor Perloff out at Berkeley. He doesn't get it all. I wrote a textbook too. He gets a small share of it. OK. So you have to decide, now has anyone bought a used version of the fourth, well it's the fifth edition now, does anybody use a version of the fourth edition? Does anyone know what the used price is? You can be honest. I don't care.


AUDIENCE: I know some people found it for like $85 or so.



PROFESSOR: So $85. So you've got to decide. So let's say you can buy the previous edition, the fourth edition, for $85 or the current edition for $130. OK? You've got to make that decision. OK? How do you make that decision. Well you may think, gee I just make the decision. It's not really about microeconomics. But it is. We're going to model how you think about a decision like that.


Well how do you think about a decision like that? Well, the first thing you consider is your preferences. How much are you willing to take a chance that there's new stuff in the fifth edition that you need to know? OK? If the fifth issue was identical to the fourth edition then you'd be an idiot to not just buy the used fourth edition. But it's not. Textbook writers are smart. They update their book. OK?


So basically, the fifth edition is updated. There's new things in it. So you have to ask yourself, what are the odds that I need some of the new information in the fifth edition and not in the fourth edition? And in thinking about that, you're going to think about your preferences. In particular, are you very risk averse, are you afraid to take a chance? Or are you risk loving? Are you willing to take a chance? OK?
That's one side of the equation.



If you're someone that says, you know I will not take a chance in life. I just have to make sure I learn the most possible from this course. Then you're going to want that new edition. If you're someone that says, you know what screw it, I'll just figure it out later. I'm going to the lectures. I don't care. OK? Then you might not want it that much. So that's the first factor, is going to be your preferences and break down how much you are willing to take a risk that you need this fifth edition.


The second factor is going to be your constraint: how much money you have. OK. The more money you have, the more you're willing, or more relevant perhaps your parents have, the more willing you are to go ahead and buy that new edition. The less money you have, the less willing you are. OK? So basically,
it's going to depend on whether you're paying or your parents are paying, in which case what the hell you might as well buy the fifth edition. OK?


And then finally, you're going to take these preferences and this constraint, your preferences and your resources, and go to the market and look at what does the market tell me the difference is. So you're going to say, here's how much I kind of care about fifth versus fourth edition, here's the resources I have, now I'll go to the market and say, aha there is a $45 difference between these two editions. So now I will solve that constrained optimization problem. And I'll decide whether I want to get that book.


You are going to be thinking to yourself, this is stupid. I never think about it that way. But the key point is you don't have to think about it exactly that way. There's a famous example in economics of what's called the as if principle. I don't know if kids still say this one, as if. So it's the as if principle. OK? And basically it's from Milton Friedman, the famous economist from Chicago, who said, look, when you're playing pool, technically you could compute the optimal angles of which to shoot the ball every single time to get the appropriate bounce and get the balls in. You could do the mathematics and compute it.


But professional pool players are not in this class with you, I'll only say that. OK? They're not guys who are able to do that computation. They just know how to hit the ball to get the same outcome they would get if they mathematically solved for the optimal trajectory to hit the ball. OK? They behave as if they've solved the constrained optimization problem. And your decision when you buy this book, you may not think it through the very framework that I just laid out very heuristically and will lay out more rigorously this semester. But you're going to behave as if you do. Because those facts are going to be in your mind, and you'll be thinking about it when you make that decision.


So while you may feel the models we learn in this course are rather abstract and don't really explain how you behave in an everyday basis, you're going to behave as if those models are really applying to you. And if you think about, over the next few days, think about the decisions you make. From should I bring an umbrella today, it looks like rain? Well, on the one hand, I might lose it. It's a pain to carry. On the other hand, how much do I care about getting wet? That's a constrained optimization decision.


To should I have an extra drink at a party Friday night? On the one hand, that could have some pros and cons. OK? These are all decisions, constrained optimization decisions, you're going to make. They're going to affect your life. And what we'll learn this semester is about how you make them and how we model, how economists can use what we learn about that to understand the function of the economy. OK?


So I'm going to stop there. One other announcement, there will, in general, be handouts every lecture. I'm not going to do PowerPoint. I'm going to do handouts. So when you come in every lecture, please look at the back banister. Though typically, not today. But typically, they'll be handouts that you'll need to follow along with in class. So remember, go to section on Friday, first problems that will be posted on Friday and it will be due in section the Friday after. And I'll see you all back here on Monday, next Monday.

PROFESSOR: Now, what we're going to do today is build on what you learned in section on Friday. On Friday, you learned about how supply and demand interact to yield equilibrium. So the sort of fundamental concepts we talked about with Adam Smith and his water-diamond paradox of supply and demand interacting to yield a market price and quantity.


And the way we're going to build on your understanding of this today is talk about what happens when you shock that supply and demand equilibrium. When things change, how does that change that supply and demand equilibrium? And that'll help build your understanding of what you learned.


So to review, let's go to our basic supply and demand graph, Figure 2-1 in the handout. You talked in section about the market for pork. That's the market Perloff uses. Seems good as any, so we'll continue to rely on that, the market for pork. And in this pork market, you have a demand curve and a supply curve.


Now, it's critical to remember what these curves represent. Once again, for this course, ideally, you understand all concepts on three levels, intuitively, graphically, and mathematically. But the intuitive is the most important, especially for those of you who aren't going to go on and do a whole lot of economics. For instance, where it's just one of the few economics courses you'll take, it's very important for your lives and using economics you understand this intuitively.


So intuitively, let's talk about what the demand curve represents. Can anyone tell me, what's the demand curve represent, from what you learned on Friday? Can anyone just take a shot? We're just-- yeah, go ahead.


AUDIENCE: The willingness of consumers to buy a certain product.


PROFESSOR: Exactly. The willingness of consumers-- I'm going to change your words just a bit, because words are important here. The willingness of consumers to pay. The willingness to pay. The difference with buy is it's really because the different amounts. They're going to be willing to pay different amounts.


So it's the willingness of consumers to pay for the good. The willingness of consumers to pay for the good. So what this says is that each point in the demand curve represents the price consumers are willing to pay for that quantity. And it's downward sloping. The demand curve is downward sloping because as the price goes up, consumers are willing to buy less of a good. So their willingness to pay changes.


So that's the demand curve. Now what about supply curve? What's a supply curve represent? Anyone? Yeah?


AUDIENCE: Pretty much the opposite. The willingness of producers to produce, like, how much they are going to charge for--


PROFESSOR: Yeah, the willingness of producers to supply the good. So how much they're going to charge for a given quantity of the good. And once again, that is upward sloping because as the price rises, they're willing to supply more. So as the price rises, consumers demand less. As the price rises, producers produce more.


And equilibrium is that point where supply equals demand. Equilibrium equals happiness. It's the point where suppliers and demanders are both happy. They're both happy because at a point such as e, the amount that consumers demand at that price is equal to the amount suppliers are willing to supply at that price.


So jointly happy. You've reached a point where consumers want a certain amount at a certain price. At that price, producers say, great, you want e, I'm happy to produce e at that price. So we've reached equilibrium.

[[Impact of a Demand Shift]
Now, let's talk about what happens when we shock that equilibrium. This is the market for pork. Imagine that the price of beef rises. The price of beef rises. Can anyone give me a guess as to what that does to the market for pork? The price of beef rises. What does that do to the market for pork. Yeah.


AUDIENCE: It reduces the demand.



PROFESSOR: It what?



AUDIENCE: Reduces the demand.



PROFESSOR: Why would it reduce the demand for pork?



AUDIENCE: Because the price [INAUDIBLE].



PROFESSOR: But I didn't say the price of pork rises. The price of beef rises. And how does beef relate to pork?


AUDIENCE: They're substitutes.



PROFESSOR: They're substitutes. Exactly. So when the price of beef prices, how does that affect people's demand for pork? Increases it. Exactly. Because they're substitutes. What we're going to learn critically as we go through is what's going to determine these demand curves importantly is going to be substitutability across goods.


So here we have a situation where the substitute for pork has gotten more expensive. As a result, people want more pork. That is a shift out in the demand curve, or a shift up in the demand curve. A shift up or out, depending on it's out into space or up vertically in the demand curve.
So what happens here is that folks shift to consuming pork, so they want more of it. So we're initial equilibrium-- we just made up some numbers-- we're initial equilibrium here at 220 millions of kilograms of pork a year and a price of $3 a kilogram. That was the initial equilibrium. That was the point where demanders and suppliers were happy.


Now the price of beef has gone up, maybe because-- I don't know. Mad cow disease or something like that has raised the price of beef. So now people are saying, hey, we want more pork. That shifts the demand curve out. Initially, if the price stayed at $3, if the price remained at $3, what would happen? What would happen is people would now-- and once again, these numbers are made up. But this is just to illustrate an example.


People would now say, gee, at a price of $3 and this further out demand curve-- now I'm on Figure 2-2, if you haven't picked that up-- I want 232 millions of kilograms of pork a year-- not I, personally. That'd be like Homer. Everybody wants 232 millions of kilograms of pork a year. I hope you guys don't get tired of Simpsons references.


So what that says is consumers say, gee, I want a lot more pork at that price. If it's going to be $3, and the price of beef just went up, I'm going to want a lot more pork. So what you're going to have initially is excess demand, because at that price of $3, suppliers are only willing to supply 220 million kilograms.
They were happy, right? They were happy at point e1. When you come along, and you say consumers now want more, they say, well, we're not happy to provide more at that price. If you want more, we're going to have to charge a higher price.


So they say, if you want more pork, we're going to have to produce more. So we are going to slide up the supply curve. So if you start at a point like e1, they say, gee, you want more pork? Well, we're going to have to slide up that supply curve. So we're moving up the supply curve and saying, we're going to have to charge you a higher price if you want more.


Well, as the price goes up, consumers say, well, wait a second. If the price is going up, I don't want quite as much more. And you meet at the new equilibrium e2. So what happens is producers say, gee, if you want more, I'm going to charge you a higher price.
Consumers say, well, gee, if you're charging a higher price, I'm going to go back up the demand curve. I don't quite want as much at that higher price. And the new equilibrium is e2. That's where consumers and producers are now happier with that outward shift in demand curve.


But the key point is consumers are not getting as much as they originally wanted at the original price, because the original price will not hold. The price is going to change. Given the price is going to change, the quantity is going to change. And you end up with both a higher price and a higher quantity for pork.


So think about it. This is pretty interesting. The price of beef rising raised the price of pork. It didn't just increase the demand for pork, but through increasing the demand, it raised the price. So price in one market affects the price in another market, not just the quantity but the price in another market. And that's our new equilibrium. That's the shift in the demand curve.


And once again, suppliers and demanders are happy. They're happy at this new point e2, this new equilibrium, because given the new demand curve, at a price of $3.50 a kilogram, producers are happy to produce the 228 million kilograms of pork a year that consumers want. And at that price, that's what consumers want.


If they're going to say, oh, it's $3.50, I want about 228. I want more than I wanted before, because beef's gotten more expensive, but not as much as I would have wanted if you hadn't increased your price. And that's the new equilibrium is e2. Yeah.


AUDIENCE: But is it possible that changing the price of pork could affect the price of beef?



PROFESSOR: Excellent. So the question is, could there be a feedback effect where, basically, now the pork market's changed, could that go back and affect the beef market? In principle, yes. In practice, we're going to make your life easy by saying no. In principle, it could. And that gets into something called "general equilibrium." And that's way too complicated for this course, so we are going to ignore those kinds of feedback effects for now. That's something you can learn about more in future courses.


But you're right. In principle, it could affect the demand for everything. You could imagine that as the price of beef goes up, that means that, for example, the cost of restaurant meals goes up. So I'm not
going to eat at the restaurant as much, so maybe I'll go to the movies more. So in principle, the price of beef going up could raise the demand for movies.


It's crazy. It's hard to know where to stop. So we're going to make your life easy by stopping at one level here. But you're right. In principle, there could be these wide range of feedbacks.


And once again, I talked in the first lecture about simplifying assumptions. We're going to try to teach you the basic concepts but try to make simplifying assumptions that make it more manageable. That's the kind of simplifying assumption we'll make for our modeling here in this course. So that's a shift in the demand curve. Yeah.


AUDIENCE: How do you quantify the shifts in the demand curve?



PROFESSOR: Excellent. And that will be exactly-- basically, the way we're going to learn in this course, we're going to do things a couple of times. When we talk about producer theory, we will teach you where this supply curve comes from. Basically, firm profit-maximizing decisions will determine the supply curve and how much it shifts, and we'll teach you that when we teach you producer theory.


So this is sort of a big overview. You're good MIT students. You're immediately thinking, where the hell do these demand and supply curves come from? That's where we're going to get to. That's the whole point of consumer theory will give us the demand curve. Producer theory will give us the supply curve. All right. Good questions.

[[Impact of a Supply Shift]
So now, let's talk about a different case. Let's talk about a shift in the supply curve. So now, let's suppose there's a drought. And let's suppose it's a drought that only affects pork. Because if the drought affected beef, that would then have these other feedback effects.


Let's imagine there's a pork drought. I don't know what that would mean, but let's imagine that happened. So suddenly, it becomes more expensive-- or let's just say there's mad pig disease. Let's imagine there's mad pig disease. So suddenly, it becomes more expensive to produce pork. Because there's fewer pigs, it's more expensive to produce it.
So what that would do is that would cause a shift in in the supply curve-- inward or upward of the supply curve. Suddenly, on you get the fact that given that it's more expensive to produce pork, suppliers say, well gee, to produce a given amount of pork, I need to get paid a higher price. So we get, once again, initially, if the price stayed constant-- so now I'm on Figure 2-3. If the price stayed constant, we would not begin with excess demand. Because if the price stayed constant, then consumers would want 220 million kilograms of pork, which is what they wanted before.


Nothing's changed from their perspective. But producers would say, look, at that price, I can only now produce 205, because my supply curve shifted up. So once again, you have to move to a new equilibrium where suppliers and consumers are happy.


That will happen at a point like e2. Because at e2, given the higher price of producing pork, producers will now say, OK, I'm happy to sell 215 million kilograms at $3.55. And consumers will say, well gee, at
$3.55, I don't want quite as much as I wanted before. I only want 215. And they're happy.



Here's what's striking. We had two very different phenomena. We had a demand shift and a supply shift. Both led to the same outcome. I'm sorry, both led to a higher price. Sorry, not the same outcome. Both led to a higher price. One led to higher demand, to higher quantity sold in the market.


So you go back to Figure 2-2. The price went up, and the quantity in the market went up from 220 to
228. In Figure 2-3, when the supply shift happened, the price also went up almost exactly the same amount. But here, the quantity fell.


So you can't tell from a price increase what happened. If the price of pork goes up, you can't tell me whether that was a demand or supply shift. You need to know both the price and quantity to be able to tell me that. Both changes led to the same outcome in terms of prices. Questions about that?

[[Government Interference: The Labor Market]
Now let's make it interesting. So we have the supply and demand equilibrium. Supply shifts, demand shifts, you move the points. You guys can all do it graphically, even if you don't quite get it intuitively yet. Now let's ask, what happens if the government comes in and messes this up?


Now, step aside to my other hat. The other course I teach is called Public Economics, which is all about the role of the government in the economy. In this course, most of what you'll learn is there's a clear
role of the government in the economy. It's to screw it up. Economics is fundamentally a right-wing science. Most of my colleagues are Democrats, but that doesn't change the fact that what we teach is fundamentally very conservative, which is the market knows best, and governments just mess things up.


Now, later in the semester, we'll talk about why that might not be true. And the whole point of my other course, 14.41, is to talk about why that might not be true and where governments can make things worse and better. But from your basic perspective, you need to be indoctrinated with this fundamental position, that the market gets it right. The market equilibrates. Governments mess things up. And that's sort of where we'll start.


So let's talk about the classic example of government messing things up, the minimum wage. You've all heard of the minimum wage, the thing workers get paid more. That seems like a good thing. Well, in fact, to economists, it's a bad thing. And let's talk about why.


To many economists, at least this initial analysis is a bad thing. We'll come back later as to why it might not be so bad. To do that, let's talk about equilibrium not in a market for goods, like pork, but in a market for inputs, which is labor. Labor is an input to the production process. We'll talk about this at great length later in the semester.


But the key thing is, just like there's a market for pork where the equilibrium outcome is the price you pay for pork and the amount of pork sold, there's a market for labor. And in that market, things are flipped. Who are the consumers now? Well, they're the firms. The firms demand labor. Who are suppliers now? Well, they're you. They're the people. People supply labor.


So now we've flipped things on its head. The suppliers are the people. The demanders are the firms. But the analysis is the same. This basic supply and demand framework, which will turn out to be so powerful this semester, can be used, even though we flipped the labels of who's on what side. So you see in Figure 2.4, we have a labor market with an upward-sloping supply curve.


What does that mean? Why is the supply curve upward-sloping? Because the higher your wage, the more you're willing to work. And we have a downward-sloping demand curve.
Why is it downward sloping? Because the higher the wage, the fewer workers the firm wants to hire. It would rather use machines instead.


So basically, you've got that same supply and demand curve, different stories as to where they come from, but the same effect in terms of determining equilibrium. We get an equilibrium at w1 l*, which is at a wage w1, l* workers are willing to work. Or l* hours are supplied of labor. We think about hours supplied, not necessarily number of workers. l* hours of labor are supplied.


And at that w1, l* workers are willing to provide l* hours, and at that w1, firms demand l* hours, and that's the equilibrium. Same analysis as before, just different stories as to what's behind the curve.


Now, let's say the government rolled in and set, as in Figure 2-5, a minimum wage. The government says, look, that wage w1 is too low-- or w* in this graph-- is too low. Workers are not paid enough in equilibrium. We need to make sure that they get paid a minimum amount. So we are going to mandate that workers cannot be paid below w lower bar, which is critically above w*.


Well, what happens in that case? Well, in that case, at that wage, workers are thrilled. They say, look at that wage. We are delighted to work-- god, the numbers are-- I'm getting old-- ls hours.


I have my prescription for my bifocals. I've had it for, like, two months, and I just can't quite take it to the mall and get them. So eventually I'll get them. I just can't quite admit I'm that old.


So workers are like, great. At that wage, we'll supply l sub s hours. That sounds great to us. We're all good. But the firm says, wait a second. No, we don't want to hire l sub s hours at that wage. That's way too high. We only want to hire at that high wage l sub d hours. So suddenly, here you have a case of excess supply. Not excess demand, excess supply. Workers want to supply more hours than firms want to hire.


Now, in our previous example, what would happen? What would happen is, if there's excess supply-- well, let me ask you. If there's excess supply in the market, how would the market equilibrate? What would happen? Yeah.
AUDIENCE: It would lower the price so that the--



PROFESSOR: In this case, the price is what?



AUDIENCE: The number of--



PROFESSOR: The wage. The wage. So exactly. In our previous example, the wage would fall. Workers would suck it up and get a lower wage. Firms would be happy to pay a lower wage. You'd reach a point where they were happy. You'd reach a point like e. But you can't now.


You can't, because the government said you can't pay less than w lower bar. So you end up with excess supply. And we call that excess supply "unemployment." You end up with unemployment, because at that high wage, firms are not willing to hire as many workers as are willing to work. And you end up in disequilibrium. You end up not in equilibrium but disequilibrium.


Now, disequilibrium is kind of hard to think about, because in some sense, this course is all about equilibrium. So I'm not talking about chaos or cats and dogs living together, breakdown of social order. That's not what I'm talking about. Disequilibrium, there is still a market outcome. The market still settles at a point.


In this case, what happens is the market settles at a wage of w lower bar because it has to and at an amount of labor delivered at l sub s, that low amount of labor delivered. Because when you're in disequilibrium, the outcome of quantity and prices is determined by the constrained party. That's the way I like to think about. You can think about it however you want.


But here's the point. Workers can't work if firms won't hire them. So if you want to say, look, we're going to end up at w lower bar, how much labor is going to be in the market? Well, it's up to the firms. They get to decide.


They're going to say, look, we don't want more than l sub d, so that's how many jobs they're going to provide. So the new outcome is going to be at a wage w lower bar and an amount of hours l sub d. So
basically, you end up with this unemployment situation where only l sub d workers are hired and the wage is w lower bar.


Now, let me ask a question. What would happen if w sub lower bar was set below w*? What if I'd redrawn this diagram so w lower bar was below w*? Yeah.


AUDIENCE: The market would equilibrate and--



PROFESSOR: Yeah, nothing would happen at the end of the day. And here's the key point-- very important point to remember-- which is that markets are very robust. Economic markets are very robust. And if they can undo the effective government intervention, they will. So if the government tries to come and intervene in a way which markets can undo and get back to where they wanted to be, they will.


That original point e is where the market wants to be. That was where it was happy. It can't get there in the example I taught here with w lower bar above w*. But if w lower bar was below w*, it could get there and be happy, so government intervention would make no difference. That's one example of a government intervention.

[[Government Interference: Gasoline Prices]
Let's do another example. Then I want to talk about the pros and cons of these government interventions. Let's do another example. Gas price ceilings. So let's consider a cap on how much can be charged for gas. Seems a pretty sensible policy. Gas is crazy expensive. We all like to drive. So let's consider a cap on the price of gas. Imagine, for example, we're initially in equilibrium, in Figure 2-6, with demand of Q2 and a price of P1. We're all happy.


Now let's imagine there's an oil crisis, because, say, oil companies decide it's a good idea to drill eight miles underground, and everything explodes, and we suddenly run out of oil. So all of a sudden, there's a constraint in the supply. Suddenly, there's a-- I'm sorry, my bad. We're initially in equilibrium at e1. My bad.


We're initially at equilibrium at e1, with a price of P1. There's a bit of mislabeling here. On the vertical axis, that upper price should be P2. So on the vertical axis, you see there's P1 equals P. Then above it, it says P1 again. That should say P2.


So we're initially in equilibrium at point e1 with a price of P1 and a quantity of Q1. Now oil tanks blow up all over the world. Suddenly, that means there's a restriction in the supply of gas. Suddenly, there's not as much gas as can be produced. So that's an upward shift in the supply curve, just like we talked about before.


And absent any government intervention, the supply curve would shift up to s2, consumers would want less gas, and you'd reach a new equilibrium at e2. And once again, let's talk about equilibrium as being where people are happy.


Now, you could say, well gee, people aren't happy paying a higher price for gas. Well, that's why I'm a bit glib using the term "happy." It's a point where the suppliers and demanders are jointly willing to make the deal. And they're willing to make the deal at e2. They're willing to say, look, given how many oil rigs have blown up, we are happy to equilibrate the market now at a higher price and a lower quantity.


But then it's September, 2010. There's an election two months away. President Obama isn't very happy about this. And he says, forget it. We're going to cap the price at P. We were paying P before. We can pay P again.


Those stupid oil companies can suck it up. They're the ones who drilled eight miles underground. They're the ones who blew everything up. They can suck it up. We're keeping the price at P. We'll help the consumer. We'll keep the price.


Well, what happens? What happens is that consumers are now, great, we continue to want Q1. That's where we were before. We're happy. But producers say, well, you know what, President, we can't supply that much at that price. Because it costs us so much to drill oil now that if you're going to force us to keep the price at P1, we are only going to supply Q sub D because we just can't supply at that low price. We're going to supply Q sub D.


So what happens, you end up with excess demand. Consumers want Q sub D gallons. Producers are willing to produce only Q sub S. And you end up with disequilibrium. And in this case, once again, the amount sold is what the producers are willing to sell. It doesn't matter how much consumers want if
producers aren't willing to sell it. You end up with disequilibrium, and you end up with much, much less gas being sold.


So yeah, the price stays low, but the amount of gas being sold is much lower than if the president allowed the price to rise. So that's another example of a government intervention causing disequilibrium. Any questions about that? Yeah.


AUDIENCE: In the last chapter, we talked about, can the government then come in and give a subsidy to the oil producers to produce the same amount?


PROFESSOR: Great. Hold that thought for 14.41. But that's exactly what the government could do. The government has lots of tools. So it can come in and say, well, on the one hand, we'll set a price cap. But then we'll come in on the other hand and give a subsidy to oil producers to make sure they do that.


That has two problems. One is, not so good with the voters. Like, gee, we're going to give subsidies to oil companies. Isn't that a great idea. Two is, you've got to raise the money somehow, which means you've got to raise taxes. Also not so good with the voters.


So it's, in general, not a good idea, because you screw it up on the one hand to screw up again. Two wrongs don't make a right, something I learned from an early age. If the government's messed up the market on the one hand, it's not, generally, a good idea to try to mess with it again to fix that. But that's exactly the kind of stuff we'll discuss in 14.41.


AUDIENCE: I've got a question about that. Will that mean that there's a [INAUDIBLE] because [INAUDIBLE]?


[[Costs and Benefits of Government Intervention]
PROFESSOR: Great segue into what I want to talk about next, which is, what are the costs and benefits of these kinds of market interventions, of a minimum wage or gas price ceiling? Why do we do this? The government, these aren't stupid people, by and large. Why do governments do things like this? What are the costs and benefits?
Now, later in the semester, we'll talk about welfare economics. By welfare, welfare has two meanings. We often think of welfare as being money distributed to poor people. That's one meaning. But when we say "welfare economics," we actually mean the well-being of society. And we'll talk about the well-being of society later on in the semester.


But let's talk for a minute about this general topic. And how do we think about the kind of welfare economics of these restrictions? Well, there's two costs and one benefit to these restrictions. The first cost is the efficiency loss. So the costs of things like the minimum wage and gas price ceilings, the first cost is the efficiency loss.


And we are going to be much more precise. This lecture is sort of a chance to be loosey-goosey about things that I'll then make much more precise throughout the semester. We'll be precise about what we mean by this throughout the semester.


But the key point is, in economics, whenever there is a trade that can be made that makes both parties better off, and it is not made, that is an inefficiency. So in economics, we define "efficient" as when all trades that can make both parties better off are made. And whenever anything comes up that interferes-- so a trade that could make both parties better off is not made-- that is inefficient. There is an efficiency loss.


And think about it. It makes sense. If both parties could be better off by a trade and don't let it happen, then society is worse off. That's the idea of an efficiency loss in economics. Economics is all about trading to make things work more efficiently. When you don't let that happen, you've hurt society. You have a welfare loss, because you have something that could've made both people better off, that would've been a good thing to do. You haven't allowed that to happen.


And if we think about it, in both these examples, Figure 2-5 and 2-6, there are trades that would've made both parties better off that we're not allowing to happen. So in the labor market case, think about a wage that's above w* and below w lower bar. So a wage in that interval.


At that wage, workers would be happy-- and take unemployed workers. Unemployed workers would be happy to work it a wage somewhat below w bar. Firms would be happy to hire them at a wage somewhat below w lower bar. But it isn't happening, because the government has interfered. That's an efficiency loss.


Likewise, look at Figure 2-6. Consumers would be happy to pay a somewhat higher price and get some more gas. Producers would be happy to produce more at that higher price. But it's not happening. That's an efficiency loss. So an efficiency loss is whenever there are trades that can make both sides better off that don't happen.


Once again, this is loosey-goosey here. We'll make this all more precise as the semester goes on. But it's important to get the big picture concept of what we mean by efficiency in economics, which is trades being made that make both parties better off.


The second cost here is what we call "allocation inefficiency." Remember in the first lecture, I talked about how prices play three roles in the market. They determine what is to be produced, they determine how it is to be produced, and they determine who gets it. That's called "allocation." Price plays a critical role in making sure that the people who want the good the most get it.


Because remember, that demand curve is a willingness-to-pay curve, or a willingness-to-buy curve. What that lets us know is the further up the demand curve, the more people want the good. And we should make sure that those people are allocated that good.


So in a world of equilibrium, we make sure that the allocation happens. Anybody who wants the good at a price that consumers are willing to sell it gets it. Someone who doesn't want it at that price doesn't get it. Equilibrium takes care of that allocation problem.


But in disequilibrium, it doesn't. Let's consider the gasoline example. Now we have a case where there are many, many people-- in fact, all the folks who lie between Qs and Qd on that x-axis-- all those folks want gas at that low price but can't get it. There's only Qs being supplied. So what happens? Well, what happened-- you guys weren't alive for this, but in the 1970s, does anyone know what happened when we did price ceilings of this type? Does anyone know what happened?


AUDIENCE: Gas shortage.



PROFESSOR: Gas shortage. And how did people respond? How was gas allocated in that gas shortage?


AUDIENCE: There were lines.



PROFESSOR: Peopled waited in huge lines. Basically, we couldn't use the price mechanism, so what did we do? We used the wait mechanism, just like they used to do in Russia all the time and still do. The point is the gas that's limited-- that Qs-- has got to get allocated somehow. In the market, it gets allocated by the price rising until the price is high enough that the set of people who want it at that price get it. With this gas price ceiling, that can't happen.


So what happens? Lines for gas. Huge, hours-long wait. This is sort of inconceivable now. Sometimes, you have to wait at a gas pump, but pretty much, you drive up, you get your gas, you leave. In the 1970s, literally, you would wait hours-- multiple hours-- in line to get gas. That was how the gas was allocated in the face of these gas price ceilings. Yeah.


AUDIENCE: What about things like the government saying you can't shut off someone's gas in the winter, even if there was a price ceiling?


PROFESSOR: OK, let me come back to that. Hold that thought for a couple minutes. I want to come back to that. But I want to focus on these gas price lines and why they're bad. Well, these gas price lines are themselves a source of inefficiency. And why? Why is it inefficient to have people waiting in line for gas? Yeah.


AUDIENCE: Because they could be working or doing other things.



PROFESSOR: They could be working. They could be out making trades that make everybody better off. Instead of being in line waiting for gas, they could've been at work, working for a wage that they were happy to earn and their employer was happy to pay. So a trade is not being made. Unless they're equally happy sitting in line waiting for gas, which is doubtful, a trade is not being made, which makes both parties better off. What else?


AUDIENCE: I have a question. Did the government know about this?


PROFESSOR: Yeah, believe me, they did. But they said, well gee, we can't let people pay those high prices. Governments face really hard decisions like this all the time. There's another program, of course, which is, what happens with people waiting in line for gas? They're idling and using up gas. So in fact, there was a direct mechanical inefficiency as well, which is all the gas that was wasted while people idled in line, waiting to get their gas.


So that's the kind of inefficiency you're used to thinking about as engineers. There's a mechanical inefficiency, but the main thing we care about is the allocative inefficiency, which is trades are not being made because people are sitting in their cars waiting for gas. And that's inefficiency. And that inefficiency arises because we have to allocate the gas somehow.


You can't get around that problem. Remember, we are the dismal science. We point out problems that cannot be surmounted. You can't get around that problem. That gas has to get allocated somehow. And if you don't let the price mechanism allocate it, some other, more inefficient mechanism will arise to do so.


Now, the trade-off, of course, is then you keep the price low. And the government's got to decide-- once again, this gets into the political economy of how the governments make these decisions. And that's not really the point of this course. But that's the kind of decision they have to make. Now let's come-- and this will touch on your question-- oh, do you have a question about this?


AUDIENCE: I have a question, actually, about the minimum wage. So isn't it a little imbalanced, because when people need work more than companies need people-- because, for example, there are a lot of instances when companies are paying hunger wages, a dollar a day. [INAUDIBLE] they're not happy for it.


PROFESSOR: Yeah, basically, in some sense, the bottom line is, equilibrium is where people are going to work for what the company's willing to pay. Now, you can say, if people want work when the company wants to offer it, that's sort of a difficult subjective judgment. But at the end of the day, if people are willing to work for a dollar and the company's willing to hire them for a dollar, then that's a trade which should be made. Except, that's a great example to point out-- same person who just said that, well then, tell me what's the benefit of a minimum wage?
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]



PROFESSOR: It's equity, that thing economists like to not think about, because it's tricky. It's fairness. It's equity. It's unfair that you would work for a dollar a day. And people might be exploited and work for unfairly low wages. Likewise, it's unfair that we pay a huge amount for gas. So people, we should keep the wage high and the prices low to make it fair. And that's the pro of the minimum wage. Yeah.


AUDIENCE: I didn't quite get [INAUDIBLE] it is giving a few people a higher wage, right? But it's causing unemployment, so how is that better?


PROFESSOR: Wonderful point. Wonderful point. That's because in economics, there's the direct effect and the indirect effect. And the direct effect is what voters understand. And the indirect effect is what we understand. In the case of gas, it was easy to see. The question, why didn't the government realize this? Everyone saw the direct effect, which was low prices, and indirect effect, which was long lines.


With a minimum wage, it's harder, because there's lots of reasons for unemployment, not just the minimum wage. So the indirect effect is a lot harder to see. If you're a politician, you're saying, look, I'll raise the minimum wage. I'll make sure you're paid more. Everybody goes, yay. And then the economist says, well, you have to understand, according to this diagram, that would lead to unemployment. People are like, whatever. Shut up.


So basically, the point is that, basically, yes, you're right. But for perceived equity, this is the case. But you're right. There's a trade-off. Just like they recognize the trade between the price and the lines, there's a trade-off between the higher wage and the employment. And that comes so what we'll talk about, empirical economics, which is measuring that trade-off.


Well, how big is that trade-off? How much unemployment does a higher minimum wage cause? In fact, we'll learn in about nine lectures that it actually doesn't cause that much unemployment. It actually doesn't. So maybe the trade-off isn't that bad. But in principle, there's a trade-off.


Now, that comes to your point about shutting people's water off and things like that, and the government making sure that the suppliers make sure people's water doesn't get shut off. Once again, one way to do that is just say to the water company, you can't shut people's water off, even if they don't
pay their bills. Well, that's going to mean the water company's going to lose money on those people. That'll raise the cost of supplying water, and that will lead to the same kind of problems we've talked about.


AUDIENCE: But if a price cap and a--



PROFESSOR: But if the government then says, OK, a price cap, and then we're going to pay you for the people who don't pay, that's kind of like the idea before. You can have these countervailing interventions. But then it starts to get messy. You've got to raise the money to pay them, et cetera.


So that's why equity is so hard. If it's efficiency, it's easy. You just don't do anything. With equity, it gets a lot harder, because government has to intervene to address equity, and then that causes other problems. It causes these equity efficiency trade-offs. And that's a lot of the problems it raises.

[[Government Intervention: Water Shortages]
So now let's talk about one last example to stop. I don't have a diagram for this one, but let's talk about the great example-- it's a real world example that happens a lot-- which is water shortages. How many people here from California? You guys know water shortages. You guys know about how this works. You guys know the drill. Which is that there'll be a drought, and the government will say, you can only use x gallons per day.


You can't water your lawn or-- actually, let me ask the Californians. So does the government monitor your meter or just tell you? Is it enforced?


AUDIENCE: Tells us.



PROFESSOR: Just tells you. So the government says, you can't do this, you can't do that. Maybe they enforce it. Maybe they don't. Whatever. But the government comes in and says, look, there's not enough water. So as a result, we are going to limit your use of water. Yeah.


AUDIENCE: They also have tiered pricing.
PROFESSOR: OK, hold on. Time out. That's because the government got smart. So let's go back 10 years ago. So what they'll do is they'll come in, and they'll say, you can't use as much water.


Now, this has two problems, just like we talked about. First of all, there are households which would happily pay more to make sure they got to use the same amount of water. And those trades are not being made. The first inefficiency. Moreover, it's got the problem that you're not allocating the water appropriately. Some guys are just dirty and don't like to shower. Some guys are clean and care a lot about showering. I want to allocate the water to the clean guys.


But the government typically doesn't do that. It just says, don't use more than x gallons. So there's an allocation inefficiency as well, where the people that value the water the most aren't getting it the most. Now, tell me about tiered pricing.


AUDIENCE: So it's like if you use 0 to 80 gallons per year or per month or whatever, you pay a certain price. And then if you use 81 to 120, you pay extra on those gallons. And then you pay even more down-
-



PROFESSOR: Exactly. So what the government can do-- the right answer is that the government can use the price mechanism to deal with the shortage. And the way it can do that is by saying, we're going to let the price increase. We're going to let the price increase, and we are going to allow the price to be a function. You see us pricing, but you make that a function of the underlying conditions and water supply.


So basically, you have a tiered pricing, and if there's a drought, the prices all go up. So the government sets the price for water, and it says, look, the price this year will be higher if there's a drought. And what that will do is that will make sure whoever wants the water gets the water and makes sure we allocate it to the people who need it the most.


Can anyone think of another way you can do this? Never really worked in reality, but it's kind of a fun way to think about it. Well, imagine that what I did is I said, every Californian gets a certain amount of water permits. Every Californian gets-- I don't know how many gallons of water people use. I don't know. You get 1,000 gallon a year water permit. How many gallons of water people use in a year? I've got no idea. 1,000? Let's say 1,000.


1,000 gallon a year water permit. We're going to give you 1,000 pieces of paper. Each one permits you to use a gallon of water. Now, what we're going to let you do is trade those pieces of paper with your neighbors. So what we're going to do is we're going to say, in normal times, basically, there's enough water, everyone gets 1,000.


Then we're going to say, when times are tight that basically, you can only use 900 gallons. So what that's going to mean is that you're going to have to have permits that allow you to use those gallons. And you're going to have to buy those permits off your neighbors. So basically, we can allow neighbors to trade.


And the neighbor that says, I don't care about water so much-- so what's going to happen now is the government's going to say, this year, we only issue 900 gallon permits to each of you, instead of 1,000. Now, you're a clean person. You say, wait a second, I wanted to use 1,000 gallons. So you go to your neighbor and say, look, you're dirty. You don't need more than 800 gallons. Sell me your extra hundred.


The government gave you 900. I want my 1,000. The government gave me 900. Sell me your extra 100. The neighbors says, sure. And they set a price, and they sell to you, and it works out to be exactly the same outcome as if the government had used the proper pricing, because that secondary market-- somebody asked about black markets-- this secondary market can evade the government regulation.


So once again, the market equilibrium is very robust. And if you can figure out a way to evade the government regulation, you will. If there's some way with permits, if there's some way to trade-- now, in reality, you can't really trade water. But if you could, then you could use a market mechanism to overcome this problem. Yeah.


AUDIENCE: Is that what-- one of the suggestions was for the global warming type thing, the carbon credits--


PROFESSOR: Exactly. So global warming-- actually, I flew with Al Gore over to Kyoto in 1997 and negotiated the global warming treaty. So something near and dear to my heart. And with global warming, that's exactly the solution that's part of the Kyoto protocol, the framework that was set up at
that meeting, which is that basically, there will be a certain limit on how much carbon dioxide can be emitted into the air. But there'll be permits, and countries can actually trade across each other.


And the idea is, look, in the US, it's incredibly expensive to reduce the emissions we have. Because what you have to do is you have to take a coal-fired plant and retrofit it to use natural gas instead. Well, in China, they haven't built the plant yet. They're building the plant. And it's not that much more expensive to build it to be natural gas instead of coal.


So in China, it's pretty cheap to reduce emissions. You just say, OK, I was going to build a coal. I'll build a natural gas instead. It's pretty much the same cost. I've just reduced emissions. So the idea is that we would trade with China, we would pollute more, China would pollute less, but the global total would be the same.


Now, as you hear that, you might think that's kind of controversial. But in fact, it makes total sense. Just like it might be controversial that dirty neighbors are selling water to clean neighbors. You can imagine the newspaper articles, the outrage. People forced to be dirty to make ends meet. But that's not right. What's right is you want to allocate to people for whom it's most efficient.


It is more efficient for China to reduce emissions because it's cheaper than for the US to reduce emissions. So the efficient system, we say, here's the total amount of emissions we're going to reduce, and we're going to let China do extra reduction, or pollute less, and the US gets to continue our slovenly ways, and that's the efficient outcome.


One last thing on this note. Many of you may know who Larry Summers is. Larry Summers was actually my thesis adviser who then went on to be Secretary of the Treasury, had a somewhat failed stint as president of Harvard and is now Obama's top economic advisor. Well, Larry Summers has gotten himself in trouble two times. You all know about the time he said women are stupid.


But the other time he got himself in trouble was in 1990, he actually signed his name to a memo. He didn't actually write it. Signed his name to a memo saying that the efficient thing to do is we should ship all our garbage to poor countries. And he said that's efficient because poor countries, what do they have? They have lots of space and not much money. What do we have? Lots of money and not much space. So the efficient thing to do is we should take our garbage and put on barges and send it to Africa.


He was right. That is the efficient thing to do. Africans would be better off, because they have lots of space they're not using, and they'd be richer. The US would be better off, because we would be able to get rid of our garbage, and we're happy to pay to do it. That's the trade to make it better off.


And yet, it got him fired, writing that memo. That's why economics is the dismal science, because we point out things like this. All right, let me stop there, and we'll come back on Wednesday and start talking in more detail about consumer demand.

PROFESSOR: So today what we're going to do is continue our discussion of supply and demand. This is sort of introduction week, if you will. We've kind of talked about supply and demand, and you guys, rightly, immediately were on to where do those curves come from. And that's what we'll start next week. But what I want to do today is talk some more about what determines the shapes of supply and demand curves and just think about an overview of how we think about supply and demand interacting in a market and what determines how responsive individuals and firms are to prices.


And, once again, remember everyone should have a handout that you should have picked up in the back on your way in. So everyone should have a handout. What we talked about last time was the sort of qualitative effects, the qualitative version of the supply and demand model. We talked about what happens when a supply curve shifts, what happens when a demand curve shifts. We talked about how either a supply shock or a demand shock could lead to the price being increased. But they could have very different effects on quantity, et cetera.


What we didn't talk about is how big these effects are. I made up some numbers. I threw them on the graphs. But I didn't talk about where the size of those effects come from. And where they come from is the shapes of the supply and demand curve. And that's what we'll talk about today is what determines the shapes of supply and demand curves. And that will be the focus of today's lecture. I'll talk both theoretically about what determines these shapes and empirically about how economists go about figuring out the shapes of supply and demand curves.


So, to think about this, let's start with Figure 3-1, which is a standard market diagram we had last time. With an initial equilibrium at point E1, with an initial price P1 and a quantity Q1. That's the equilibrium that's stable. Because at that price P1, consumers demand Q1 units, and suppliers are willing to provide Q1 units. So that's a stable equilibrium.
Now we have some supply shift. Last time we talked about somehow a pork-specific drought. That leads the supply to shift inward. So the supply curve rises to S2. At that new price, initially, you would have excess demand. But quickly the price increases to shut off that excess demand. And you end up with a new equilibrium with a higher price, P2, and a lower quantity Q2, and new equilibrium point E2. OK?
And we talked that through last time.



What I want to talk about this time is well, what determines the size of that shift from Q1 to Q2 and that price increase from P1 to P2? What's going to determine it is the elasticity of supply and demand. The elasticity of supply and demand is how much do supply and demand respond? Do the quantities supplied and the quantities demanded respond when the price changes?


When we say, how elastic is demand, what we mean is how sensitive to price is the quantity demanded. Or, alternatively, what is the slope of that demand curve? So the slope of the demand curve will be the sensitivity of quantity demanded to the price consumers face. And that will determine the market responsiveness.


In economics, it's always true that the best way to think about things is to go to extremes. You have to remember that extremes don't exist in the real world. But it's a useful teaching device to think about extremes.


So let's think about one extreme case in Figure 3-2. Let's think about the case of perfectly inelastic demand. Perfectly inelastic demand, that's where there's no elasticity of demand. What that means is that demand for a good is unchanged regardless of the price. So perfectly inelastic demand is a case where demand for the good is unchanged regardless of the price. That would lead you to have a vertical demand curve at a given quantity. What this says is regardless of the price, people always demand Q.


Can anyone tell me what would cause demand to be perfectly inelastic? In what types of situations would demand be-- it's never perfectly inelastic-- would demand be relatively inelastic? Yeah?


AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].



PROFESSOR: It's all about substitutes. When there's no substitutes, when there's nowhere to go, it doesn't matter what the price is. When there's no substitutes, demand will be perfectly inelastic,
because you have to have Q. It doesn't matter what the price is. Because there's no substitute for that good. So if you wanted amount Q of that good for any reason, you're always going to want that amount Q no matter the price.


So a perfectly inelastic good would have no substitutes. So you'd always want Q no matter what. Can anyone think of an example? There's no perfectly inelastic good in the world. But what sorts of goods? Yeah?


AUDIENCE: Medicines.



PROFESSOR: Medicines. Now, not necessarily all medicines. So give me an example of a medicine which would be more or less inelastic. So I don't even need a medical name. What sort of treatments?


AUDIENCE: Like heart attack maybe?



PROFESSOR: Yeah, something which is sort of lifesaving. The best thing that we often use is insulin for diabetics. Diabetics without getting that insulin to manage their diabetes will die. That seems like that's something where there's not a whole lot of substitutes. The substitute is dying. So basically that's where demand is relatively inelastic. Or a heart transplant, when you get a heart transplant or any kind of transplant, you have medicine you take so you don't reject the transplanted organ. That sort of medicine demand should be very inelastic.


Elastic drug, well, our favorite example is always Viagra. It's something where you'd think that you can probably survive without it. And people would want less Viagra if you charged a lot more for it than if you charged less for it. So elasticity is going to be about substitutability. And that's going to determine inelastic demand.


Now, what happens with inelastic demand when there's a supply shock? When supply increases, what happens? Well, in that case, there can never be excess demand, because demand doesn't change. So all that happens is price just increases. If there's inelastic demand, and there's a supply shock, then all that happens is an increase in price and no change in quantity. So with inelastic demand, quantity doesn't change for a price increase. Price just goes up. From a supply shock, prices just goes up.


Now, let's consider the opposite. Let's look at Figure 3-3 and think about perfectly elastic demand. Perfectly elastic demand is demand where consumers, essentially, don't care about the quantity. They just care about the price. That is, there are infinitely good substitutes. A perfectly elastically demanded good would be one where there are, essentially, perfect substitutes. An inelastic good is where there's no substitute. A perfectly elastic good would be where there's perfect substitutes.


Technically, if a good is perfectly elastically demanded, then you are completely indifferent between that good and a substitute. Well, if you're completely indifferent, then if the price changed at all, you would immediately switch. And so the price can't change.


What's an example? Once again, there's no good example of a perfectly elastic good. Yeah?



AUDIENCE: Candy.



PROFESSOR: What?



AUDIENCE: Candy.



PROFESSOR: Candy. OK. So you've got your Wrigley's gum. I like the sugar-free, minty gum. You've got Orbit and Eclipse. And I go to the store, and they're all pretty much the same price. If Orbit was more than Eclipse, I just buy Eclipse. They're the same. They're minty gum. It doesn't make a difference. So basically the price is the same.


If there's a supply shock, I don't know, they're made with the same shit. But let's say that Eclipse has some magic ingredient. And let's say the Eclipse magic ingredient got more expensive, so the supply curve shifted up. Well, Eclipse could not respond by raising its price. Because I just switched to Orbit.


Or we often think of McDonald's and Burger King. Now, they're less perfect substitutes, but pretty perfect. If McDonald's started charging $10 for a hamburger, you wouldn't go there anymore. You'd go to Burger King.


So if there's a supply shock to a provider  that's facing a perfectly elastic demand curve, they cannot raise their price, because people will just switch. So quantity will fall a lot. Because if I'm supplying Eclipse gum, and it suddenly costs a lot more to produce Eclipse gum, but I can't raise my price, because I will lose all my business to Orbit, I'm just going to produce a lot less Eclipse. Because I'm losing money now.


So with perfectly inelastic demand, the quantity didn't change. With perfectly elastic demand, we saw a big quantity change. So, more generally, what determines the quantity change in response to a price change is the elasticity. More generally, we're between these two cases of perfectly elastic and perfectly inelastic. And what's going to determine the price change is going to be the price elasticity of demand epsilon which is going to be the percentage change in quantity for each percentage change in price or, in calculus terms, dQ/dP. So it's, basically, the percentage change in quantity for the percentage change in price.


So, for example, if for every 1% increase in price quantity falls 2%, that is a price elasticity of demand of minus 2. The price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity for the percentage change in price.


So inelastic demand is an epsilon of 0. There is no change in quantity when price changes. Perfectly elastic demand is an epsilon of negative infinity. Any epsilon change in price leads to a negative infinite change in quantity. Immediately, the quantity goes to 0 if you try to raise your price.


So the price elasticity of demand will typically be between 0 and negative infinity. And the larger it is the more quantity will change when prices change. Questions about that? Yeah?


AUDIENCE: So that formula, shouldn't it be dQ/dP times P/Q because dQ/dP just refers to the change of the quantity with respect to price, not necessarily the percent change.


PROFESSOR: Yeah, you're right. I was trying to get too fancy with my calculus. You're right. Let's just stick with the non-calculus formula. I never should deviate from my notes. So let's just stick with the non- calculus formula. OK, other questions about this? OK. So, basically, that's the elasticity. That's going to be the elasticity.


Now, an interesting point about elasticity is now, we're not going to get into producer theory for a couple of lectures. But as a little peek ahead about producer theory, let's think about how elasticity determines the money that producers make from selling their goods.


Well, if a producer sells Q goods at a price P, they make revenues R. Revenues are the price times the quantity. The amount of money a producer makes when it sells goods, its revenues, this isn't its profits. We're not having profits. It's just the amount of money it makes, not the amount of money it takes home at the end of the day. I'm ignoring the cost of making the goods. The amount of total revenues it makes is price times quantity.


Well, we can then say that the change in revenues with respect to price is what? It's Q plus dQ, plus delta Q-- let me put it this way to make my math clearer-- plus P times delta Q over delta P. That's how revenues change with respect to price. Or, in other words, plugging in from the elasticity formula, delta R over delta P equals Q times 1 plus epsilon.


So, in other words, what this says is that if you're a producer, and you're trying to decide whether to raise your price, whether that will increase revenues, it all depends on the elasticity. If the elasticity is between 0 and minus 1, then raising prices will raise revenues. If the elasticity is greater than minus 1, then raising prices will lower revenues.


We're often faced with the issue of why did they charge this much for this good, or should they raise their prices or not raise their price. Well, that's all about the elasticity of demand. The elasticity of demand will determine whether they're going to make more money by raising their price or lose money by raising their price.


For Eclipse gum, their elasticity of demand is well above minus 1 in absolute value, so they're going to lose money by raising their price. If they take the current level of Eclipse, for every penny they raise, they'll lose money. For insulin, for every penny they raise, they'll make money.


And then you might say well, then how come the price of insulin isn't infinity and the price of Eclipse gum isn't zero? Well, that's what we'll talk about in a few weeks. Because it also depends on the costs of
producing it. But at the end of the day, that's what's going to determine the money that's made by producers when they change their prices. Questions about that?

[[Using Empirical Economics to Determine Elasticity]]
OK. So now, that's how we think about the shape of supply and demand. The shape of supply and demand is determined by these elasticities. So now we have to get into OK, well, where do we get these elasticities from? And that is the main topic of empirical economics which is estimating these kinds of elasticities, estimating these types of elasticities.


So one of the first distinctions I drew in the lectures is between theoretical economics and empirical economics. Theoretical economics can tell us this is what a graph looks like and supply and demand. Theoretical economics can't really tell us how big, for example, an elasticity is going to be. It can tell us, there's more substitutes or less substitutes so we can rank them. We know the elasticity for Eclipse gum has got to be higher than the elasticity for insulin.


But from the theoretical model, we can't say what the elasticity actually is. To say what an elasticity actually is, we need to go to an empirical model. We actually need to bring data to bear on the question.


And this is very difficult. Because here we face the fundamental conundrum facing the empirical economist which is distinguishing causation from correlation. And the whole guts of empirical economics is all about this question, distinguishing causation from correlation.


The classic story that illustrates this, it's due to my colleague, Frank Fisher, from a textbook many years ago, was the story of in ancient Russia there was a cholera outbreak, and many people were dying. So the government decided to send doctors out to try to solve the problem. And where there were more people sick, they sent more doctors.


Well, the peasants said, wait a second. We observe that where there's more doctors, more people are dying from cholera. So the doctors must be causing the cholera. So they rose up and killed the doctors.


The peasants confused causation with correlation. They thought that the fact that you saw more people dying where there's more doctors meant that doctors were causing the disease. Clearly that's wrong.
That's why they were peasants. But it's not just peasants that make this mistake.


For example, in 1988, Harvard University, our illustrious neighbor to the south, I guess, west, east, I don't know. Which way is Harvard? I don't know directions, down the street. A Harvard University dean conducted an interview with a set of freshmen. And they found that those that had taken SAT preparation courses-- now, you all took SAT preparation courses. But in 1988, not everyone did. Those who'd taken SAT preparation courses scored an average of 63 points lower-- this was back when the SAT was 1600 points-- 63 points lower on their SATs then those that had not taken preparation courses.


The dean concluded that preparation courses were unhelpful, and that the testing industry was preying on the insecurities of students to provide a useless service. Why was the dean confusing causation with correlation? What did the dean get wrong in drawing that conclusion? Yeah?


AUDIENCE: What had probably happened is the students who got worse scores realized that they wanted to try and improve their scores by taking an SAT prep class. So that's why there is a lower average score for the people who had taken the class.


PROFESSOR: Generally, the people who needed the help the most took the most courses. And so they had an underlying lower score. So, in fact, you can't tell anything from the fact that the people who took the prep course scored worse. It's just another excellent example of confusing causation with correlation. And that's another example.


Another example I like quite a lot is studies of breastfeeding. There are numbers of studies of breastfeeding, especially in developing countries, where they found that the longer children were breastfed the sicker they were. So they concluded that breastfeeding was bad for kids. Well, that's not the truth. The truth is the sicker kids need to be breastfed more, because breastfeeding is actually good for kids. And they just confused the causation with the correlation.


Now, these are all fun examples. But the truth is this is a common mistake made by citizens, policy makers, everyone in the real world. It's taking two things that move together and assuming one causes the other. And this is the fundamental conundrum facing empirical economics in trying to address these kinds of things like measuring elasticities.
So to understand that, let's think about the issue of trying to estimate the elasticity of demand for pork. Let's say you have the exciting job of estimating the elasticity of demand for pork. That's your assignment. Well, you say, wait a second. What we learned in class, as shown in Figure 3-4, is that the price of pork can rise for very different reasons.


Figure 3-4, we start at an initial equilibrium like E1 with a quantity like Q1 and a price P1. Now, imagine that there was a shift in demand, because the price of beef rose, remember? The price of beef rose.
That shifted demand from D1 to D2. What did that lead to? A higher price and a higher quantity.



So if you took that diagram-- forget the supply shift for a minute, just imagine that's the change-- and you said, aha. I can measure the elasticity. I see here there's a change in price. I can then look at how quantity changed. And I'll get the elasticity right after all. It's delta Q over Q or delta P over P.


So I just look, and I take Q2 prime minus Q1 over Q1. That's the percentage change in Q. I take P2 over P1 over P1. That's the percentage change in price. And what do I get? A wrong signed elasticity is what I get. I get a positive elasticity, because Q is going up and P is going up. Why? Because I'm confusing causation with correlation.


It's not the price change that caused quantity to change. In fact, it's the opposite. It's a taste shift, which caused quantity to increase which drove up the price. It was a demand increase which caused the quantity demanded to increase which drove up the price. So it's the quantity driving the price, not the price driving the quantity.


So if you looked at that simple example, as many people in the real world do, they'd say, hey, look. Higher prices cause higher quantities. You're getting the wrong answer. Because you're confusing correlation which is the higher price is correlated with the higher quantity. Because there was a common factor causing both of them which is the demand shift and not causation. The higher price did not cause the higher quantity.


What do we need to do? We need to distinguish why the price increased. We need to distinguish why the price increased to measure this. If, instead, we looked at a shift in supply such as the case that's shifting from S1 to S2 and moving the equilibrium from E1 to E2, then you would get the right answer. Because then you'd say, look. Something independent to consumers shifted up the price. Some shock to the supply of pork shifted up the price. And we saw that their quantity fell as a result.


What's the key? The key is that to measure an elasticity of demand, you're measuring the slope of the demand curve. So you need to shift along a demand curve, not shift the demand curve itself.


So if you look at this figure, what's the concept we want? We want the slope of the demand curve. Well, you get that by shifting from E1 to E2, because you shift along the demand curve. So by looking at what happens to quantity as price rises from E1 to E2, you get the slope of the demand curve. You get that delta Q over delta P you want.


But from E1 to E2 prime, you're not shifting along the demand curve. You're actually measuring the elasticity of supply. You're measuring the elasticity of supply. You're shifting along a supply curve. So you're actually answering a different question, a relevant question, but a different one. That question is, what's the elasticity of supply? How willing are pork producers to supply pork as the price goes up?


So it's the same delta Q over delta P. But here we did the elasticity of demand. There's a corresponding elasticity of supply which is measured the same way. It's delta Q over delta P, but it's for a different kind of shock. It's what you get from moving along the supply curve.


So if we went from E1 to E2 prime, we can use that to measure the elasticity of supply or the slope of the supply curve. And we do that if something shifts demand to move us along the supply curve. From E1 to E2, we measure the elasticity of demand as something shifts supply and moves us along the demand curve.

[[Elasticity and Taxation]]
So what we need to measure the elasticity of demand is something which shifts supply but does not, itself, affect demand. And the best example of this that we use in economics, a great example, is government policy which comes along and changes the supply conditions for a good.


So, for example, let's think about a tax on pork. So if you go to Figure 3-5, imagine the government came along and taxed pork. The government comes along and taxes pork. Let's think about what a tax on pork does.
The government comes along, and let's say the pork market is initially in equilibrium at $3.30 with 220 million kilograms of pork sold. Now the government comes along and says that it's going to charge $1.05 in tax for every kilogram of pork. So it's going to impose a tax of $1.05 per kilogram on producers. So it's saying to producers of pork, for every kilogram of pork you sell, you have to send a check to the government for $1.05. For every kilogram of pork you sell, you have to send a check to the government for $1.05.


Now, somebody talk me through how a supplier thinks through that. How does a supplier react to that? What do they think? They're initially happy at E1 selling 220 million kilograms at $3.30. What happens when the government comes in and says you have to pay $1.05 for every kilogram of pork you sell?
What happens? Yeah.



AUDIENCE: The producer decides that the current amount of money they have will not be able to buy as much inputs to create their products. So they can produce less.


PROFESSOR: Exactly. So, in other words, the cost of producing just rose. So what do they do? So, in other words, what they say is look, effectively, if I was happy before selling 220 million kilograms at
$3.30, to keep me equally happy selling 220 million kilograms, I'm going to have to raise the price. We should add this to graph, actually.


If you draw a vertical line up for me, one to the S2 curve. Draw a little dashed line up from the E1 to the S2 curve and then over. That price intersection will be $4.35. So in other words, if you want me to keep producing 220 million kilograms of pork, I'm going to have to get $4.35 a kilogram. And you might say, what gives you the right to get that? And it's not about rights. It's about what producers are willing to do.


That same mathematics, that same supply curve that tells us they're willing to sell 220 million kilograms at $3.30 says, if you want them to keep selling 220 million kilograms but also pay $1.05 to the government, they're going to have to get $4.35 a kilogram.


So what happens is that's a supply shift. And with the same reaction we saw last time with the drought, the price goes up, consumers demand less, and you reach a new equilibrium at the price E2. You reach a new equilibrium where you sell 206 million kilograms for a price of $4.00.


So someone tell me how I use this example to find elasticity of demand. Yeah.



AUDIENCE: I guess you need to know that the change in price traveled along the demand curve. So you know that it's not [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].


PROFESSOR: OK, so tell me. You don't have to do the math in your head. But how would I compute it?



AUDIENCE: You would take E1 and E2, and then you would do the price over the quantity change.



PROFESSOR: Right, exactly. So the quantity change delta Q over Q, is what? It's minus 14 over 220. It fell by 14 million kilograms over 220. The price change, delta P over P, the price rose from $3.30 to $4.00. So the price change is $0.70 over $3.30.


And using those, you end up with a price elasticity of minus 0.3. Or, in other words, there's a 6.4% change in quantity. This is minus 6.4% for a 21% change in price. So quantity falls by 6.4% when price goes up by 21%. That's a price elasticity of minus 0.3. Or that's a relatively inelastic demand. It's not perfectly inelastic, but it's relatively inelastic. In other words, at that point, pork producers could make money by raising the price.


Now, you might say well, why didn't they? That's something we'll discuss in a couple weeks. But at that point, demand is relatively inelastic. And you've got a convincing estimate, because you moved along that demand curve. You used the supply shift.


Now, we're going to talk about taxation much, much later in the semester. Let me just talk for one minute about what we learned from this graph. What happens? Well, the shaded area is the money the government raises from its tax. The government has a tax of $1.05 at 206 million kilograms. So it raises
$1.05 times 206 million kilograms which is that shaded area.
There are two points to note the we'll come back to later in the semester. The first point to note is the amount of money the government raises will depend directly on the elasticity of demand. Can anyone tell me how much money the government would raise if you had a perfectly inelastic demand? Yeah.


AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].



PROFESSOR: Right. If we think about this demand curve being perfectly flat, if we think about this demand curve being perfectly flat, then basically the producer can't charge any more for their good. So it's going to depend on whether the producer is willing to sell at $1.05 less and how much less they're willing to sell. If they're willing to sell a lot less, they're going to make a lot less money.


It's going to be where that second supply curve intersects a flat demand curve. So that quantity is going to be a lot smaller. We don't have it on the diagram. But you see where that dashed line at $3.30 intersects S2, that's way to the left. Quantity is going to fall a ton in this market. When quantity falls, the government is going to raise a lot less money. Because the government raises $1.05 on every unit sold at the end.


So if the government taxes very elastically demanded goods, it's going to raise less money. If it taxes inelastically demanded goods like insulin, it's going to raise more money, because the quantity doesn't change. Yeah.


AUDIENCE: So cigarettes are relatively inelastic.



PROFESSOR: Yes, exactly. Cigarettes are relatively inelastic. The elasticity is around minus 0.5. So the government will actually raise money by raising the cigarette tax.


Those of us, as good liberals, think we should tax yachts. Let's tax yachts. Only rich guy have yachts. The problem is yachts are incredibly elastically demanded. So you raise a lot less money taxing yachts than you think. Because guys buy fewer yachts, and you don't raise as much money as you think you would. You still raise some, and it still may be worth it. But you raise less than you think. So that's one sort of observation about this. It's basically how much money you'll raise will be a function of how elastic the demand is.


The other important observation to make is why it's actually hard for governments to figure out how much money they're going to raise for a tax. Because, to figure it out, they need to know these elasticities. That is, the naive thing to do would have been to say what? Well, we're selling 220 million kilograms of pork. That's $1.05. We're going to tax each kilogram. So that's 220 million times $1.05. And that's how much money we raise. Well, that's wrong, we know, because that assumes inelastic demand. If demand's elastic, they'll raise less than that.


Well, if we want to figure out how much a government is going to raise from a tax, they've got to know what these elasticities are. And those are actually pretty hard things to know. So that's why there's uncertainty. That's why when politicians will say, this tax will raise x and you'll hear the New York Times report, the tax will raise x, that is a guess. Those are guesses, because they depend on our best estimate of the key elasticities that determine how people respond. Yeah.


AUDIENCE: But in Washington you have tax cuts that raise money.



PROFESSOR: Well, some claim you do. You don't actually. But some claim you have tax cuts that raise money. That's because they think the elasticity is very large. If the elasticity is large enough, a tax cut can raise money. So, basically, that's all about that some people think that elasticities are large enough that tax cuts can raise money. Those people are wrong. But that's what they claim. Yeah.


AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].



PROFESSOR: Yes. Excellent point. You'll go through that in section on Friday. So what I've done is I've done an example of a constant elasticity curve. Actually, I've done something here which is logically inconsistent. This curve is linear which means it can't be constant elasticity. If it's constant elasticity, it would have to curve.


So what I've estimated here is a local elasticity. I have estimated the elasticity around that price change. But the elasticity, if this curve is true, would be different at different points on this curve. If the elasticity is going to be constant all over the curve, and you're going to do a constant elasticity of demand, that's going to be a curve that bends, not a linear curve. So a linear demand curve is not constant elasticity of demand.


We will typically ignore that issue and focus on local elasticities. But that is an important issue. We'll discuss that in section on Friday, the difference between constant elasticity of demand curves and linear demand curves. But, typically, we're think about local changes. So if it's local enough, it doesn't really matter. But, for a broad change, it will matter what the shape of the curve is. Good point. Other questions?

[[Elasticity and Medical Care]]
OK. Let me then turn to another problem we face in empirical economics. So this is an example of a problem we're facing in empirical economics. Let me turn to an example of another problem we face in empirical economics estimating elasticities. It is that individuals often choose the price they face.
Individuals, typically, often don't just face a price that's given to them. And then you can say, OK, they're given a price, and we see how they respond. They often choose the price they face.


Let me explain what I mean by that. A classic example of an elasticity that matters a lot for policies is the elasticity of demand for medical care, the elasticity of demand for medical care. That is how much less medical care will you use if you have to pay for it?


So, for example, most of us have insurance through MIT or maybe through our parents. And the way health insurance works is you pay a certain amount per month or your parents do, and, in return, that health insurance covers the cost of your medical care, most of it. But, typically, you have to pay some of it.


So how many people have gone to the doctor in the last six months? Did you have to pay something? How much did you pay? Did you pay a copayment? No? None of you? Yeah. How much did you pay?


AUDIENCE: I think like $20.



PROFESSOR: $20, $10, $5, that's what's called the copayment, or $0. Most insurance these days has what's called copayments. A copayment is what you pay when you go to the doctor. Insurance picks up the rest. You don't know. You didn't know how much the whole doctor visit cost. You just went, you gave them your card. They said your copayment is $20. You gave them $20. You don't know. The visit might have cost $100, $200, $500, $1,000. You don't know. Your insurer picks up the rest. You pay the copayment.


Copayments are rapidly on the rise in health insurance. There's a rapid rise in copayments. Increasingly, insurers are saying, look, health care costs are out of control. One way we're going to combat them is by making people bear more of the cost that they use.


I could go on forever about how I'm a health care economist. I could go on about health care forever. But just to fix ideas on why this is an issue, in 1950, the US economy spent 5% of our gross domestic product, 5% of our size of the economy went to health care. Today it's 17%. By 2075, it's projected to be 40%. That is of every dollar that's made in America, $0.40 will go to medical care. By 100 years later, it's about 100%. Literally, if we do nothing, the entire economy will be health care.


Obviously, that can't happen. We've got to deal with this. And one way that insurers and some policy makers are saying we need to deal with this is we need to make consumers bear more of the costs of their medical care. We need to make consumers pay more when they go to the doctor, so that they understand the consequences of their decision.


Well, if we're going to do that, a key question we need to know is well, does it affect their behavior? If we make consumers pay more, and it doesn't at all affect their demand for medical care-- it's just a tax on them, essentially-- then that's different than if it causes them to use less medical care. It may be good, may be bad. We'll come back to that.


But the key empirical question is what is the elasticity of demand for medical care? If you pay $20 and you pay $0, how much less like are you to use the doctor when you pay $20 versus when you pay $0. Well, we can all introspect this and think about it. But, in fact, to answer this we have to go to the data and ask, well, what's the difference?


So people, for many years, went to the data. And they said, look, there's all sorts of differences out there across people and what they pay for their copayments. Some people have insurance where they pay nothing, some where they have $20. Some people have what they call high-deductible plans. A deductible plan is where you pay the full cost of your visits until you reach some limit. So a $2000 deductible plan will be one where you pay all of your medical costs until you've spent $2,000. It's a big copayment.
So we look across those people, and people did. And they found, look, the people that have plans where they spend more for health care, where they have a high copayment, use a lot less health care than where they don't have to spend anything. The elasticity of demand looks very, very high. What is wrong with those studies? What is wrong with the conclusion those people drew? They drew it by comparing people who had plans where they paid a lot to go to the doctor, and therefore use a lot less care to people who didn't pay anything when they went to the doctor and used a lot more care. I pick the $20 person, because I picked on you already.


AUDIENCE: Probably they chose to have a high-deductible plan, because they don't often go to the doctor already.


PROFESSOR: The rational choice, if you're young and healthy, for almost everyone in this room, is going to be a very high-deductible, high copayment plan. Because it will cost you less money, because the insurer is shifting the money to you. But you don't use the doctor anyway. So who cares?


So the healthier people are going to choose the plans where they pay more. So, of course, you're going to find in the plans where people pay more they use less medical care. But is it because they're paying more, or is it because healthy guys choose those plans? It's causation versus correlation. We don't know.


Well, how can we figure that out? Well, if we were doctors, what we'd do-- real doctors, not a doctor like me, a real doctor, a medical doctor-- what we'd do is we'd run a randomized trial. So if doctors want to figure out whether a drug works or not, they don't just look at guys who take the drug versus guys who don't. They run a randomized trial. They randomly assign some people to take the drug and some people not.


Now, when you run a randomized trial, by definition, you get a causal effect. Well, this room isn't quite big enough. We all know the law of large numbers. But imagine there were four times as many people in this room or five times as many people in this room. OK? And I had you come up to the front. I flipped a coin and said half of you are going to take the drug, and half of you are not, randomly by the flip of a coin.


Then, by definition, any statistically noticeable differences I get between the group the takes the drug and the group that doesn't is caused by the drug. And how do I know that? Because I know the groups
are otherwise identical by the law of large numbers. By the law of large numbers, I know that as long as I have enough people, they're identical.


So if the only difference between them is that one's taking the drug and one's not, that's a randomized trial. That would be how I could solve the causation versus correlation problem. In medicine, thousands of randomized trials every day are being run. In fact, the FDA, before it will approve a drug, will typically require a randomized trial.


Well, in the social sciences, it's harder to run randomized trials. Because we're actually trying to understand things like people's demand for medical care, not whether a drug works or not. But, in fact, one of the most famous social randomized trials in history was called the RAND Health Insurance Experiment run in the 1970s. This is where some innovative health economists who understood this problem that we laid out about the fact that you can't just compare more or less generous health insurance policies, actually randomized health insurance policies across people.


They recruited volunteers, and they literally said, we're going to randomize. Some people are going to have policies where the health care is free, and some people are going to have policies where they have to pay, essentially, all the costs of health care.


So they, essentially, randomized across these different groups. And, therefore, they can assess what the price elasticity was. Because they knew the price difference between groups. For one, the price was zero. For one, the price was one. They actually had a range of prices they varied it across.


They could look at the quantity response, and they knew that was a quantity response to the price, because people weren't choosing their prices. The prices were being assigned to them. What did they find? Well, they found that medical demand is elastic, although not as elastic as the previous study. It's somewhat elastic. It's not as elastic as the previous studies found. They found that the elasticity of demand for medical care is around minus 0.2. So when the price goes up, people use less medical care but not that much less.


Now, let's be clear. Remember what elasticity is. That delta Q over Q. The same study showed that if you take someone who paid nothing and make them pay almost everything, their utilization of medical care falls by 45%. That's consistent with that small elasticity. Because that's a huge delta P, percent delta P. So, basically, that's comes to the question about local versus global elasticities.


So it's not saying that prices don't matter. But it's not a very, very elastically demanded good. So that's how they measure that price of elasticity of demand. That experiment, which was run over 35 years ago now, that result drives much of what we do in health policy.


So a lot of the estimates that we saw for the recently passed health reform bill derived from how do we get that estimate. We'll have to figure out how people are going to respond with their medical care when we give them health insurance. The recently passed health care bill just gave 32 million people health insurance.


Well, how are they going to respond to having health insurance? We go back to the RAND estimates and say, well, we have this elasticity of demand. We know what we're doing to the price. We figure out how much medical care is going to go up.


But here's the other thing. Here's the question in the lecture that that we'll close with. Is that a good thing or a bad thing that medical care fell when the price went up? And how would we tell whether it's a good thing or a bad thing? So we know when we raise the price, people use less medical care. How can we tell if that's a good thing or a bad thing? In the same experiment, how could we tell? What could we do? Yeah.


AUDIENCE: Maybe you'll get death rates or like--



PROFESSOR: You look at their health. You say, look, the same trial can answer a different question. We know that when you charge someone for health care, they use less. Well, are they sicker? The answer, not at all. People use less health and were no sicker. Why? Because we waste a huge amount of health care in the US. A huge amount of health care is wasted.


So, in fact, we could cut back quite a lot on health care, and we'd be no sicker. And that's what the RAND experiment showed, that we can charge people to use medical providers. And they'll use less medical care, and they won't be sicker as a result. Which suggests that, actually, as we try to think about getting our health care costs under control in America, making people pay something to go to the doctor is not a crazy thing to be thinking about.
How much? Well that depends on efficiency versus equity. We can't make someone who has no income pay $1,000 to go to the doctor. That, clearly, is a mistake. But we can take a rich guy like me and make me pay $50 to go to the doctor. There's no reason not to do that. So, basically, that's a lesson of how you can use elasticity of demand to help inform the kind of policies we need to make.


OK, let me stop there. By the way, if you at all find this stuff interesting, and you haven't yet read Freakonomics-- how many of you have read Freakonomics? That's amazing. OK. If you haven't read Freakonomics, you should. It's a great book. If you're lazy, the movie is coming out. And Freakonomics the movie is premiering on Friday the 30th at LSC. So if you're interested in learning more about empirical tools in economics, you can watch Freakonomics the movie on Friday the 30th.
