The father of modern economics was a professor here, and he basically founded the field. He basically introduced mathematics to economics. And through teaching this course, 14.01, 50, 60 years ago, actually developed the field that we now study.\n\n\nNow, what we're going to do in this class, is focused on two types of actors in the economy: consumers and producers. OK? And we are going to build models of how consumers and producers behave. Now, technically, a model is going to be a description of any relationship between two or more economic variables. OK? That's a model. A description of any relationship between two or more economic variables.\n\n\nThe trick with economics, and the reason many of you will be frustrated during the semester, is that unlike the modern relationship between say energy and mass these models are never precise. They are never accurate to the 10th decimal. OK? This is not a precise, scientific relationship with modeling. We'll be making a number of simplifying assumptions that allow us to capture the main tendencies in the data. That allow us to capture the main insights into how individuals make consumption decisions and how firms make production decisions. But it's not going to be as clean and precise as the kind of proofs you're going to be doing in some of your other classes in freshman and sophomore year. OK?\n\n\nSo basically, we have a trade off with the simplifying assumptions. On the one hand, obviously we want a model that can explain reality as much as possible. If a model can't explain reality, it's not useful. On the other hand, we need a model that's tractable, a model that I can teach you in a lecture or less. OK? And basically, what we do is we make a lot of simplifying assumptions in this class to make those models work. And yet, what we'll find is despite these assumptions, we'll come up with incredibly powerful predictions of how consumers and producers behave.\n\n\nSo with consumers what we're going to do is, we're going to say that consumers are constrained by their limited wealth or what we'll call their budget constraint. And subject to that constraint they choose the set of goods that makes them as well off as possible. OK? That's what we're going to call utility maximization. We'll say the consumers maximize their utility, consumers are going to maximize utility subject to a budget constraint. That's going to be what we're going to develop the consumer decision.\nThey have some utility function which is going to be a model of their preferences. OK?\nSo I'm going to propose to take everything you love in life and write it down as a u function. OK? Then I'm going to propose you take all the resources at your disposal, write them down as a budget constraint and then I just do constrained maximization to solve for how you make decisions. Firms, on the other hand, are going to maximize profits. Pi is profits. Firms are going to maximize profits. Their goal is to make as much profit as possible, to earn as much money as possible. OK? However, that's going to be subject to both the demands of consumers, we get to firms it's a lot harder, subject to both consumer demand and input costs.\n\n\nSo firms have to consider, consumers have to consider look what does stuff cost and what do I like, I'll make my decision. Firms is a little more complicated. They've go to consider, what do consumers want and how do I make what they want? So they've got to consider both the output side, what a consumer is going to want me to make and what's it going to cost me to produce that good? And how do I combine those to make the most profits? OK?", "start": "01:00:44"}, "Heading3": {"text": "\n\n[[Important Distinctions in Economics]\nNow, so that's basically, sort of, an overview about, sort of an example, of how we think about the role of prices. Now, let me draw a couple of important distinctions, terms I'm going to use this semester that I want you to be comfortable with. OK? The first distinction I want to draw is between theoretical versus empirical economics. Theoretical versus empirical economics. OK. Theoretical economics is the process of building models to explain the world. OK? Empirical economics is the process of testing those models to see how good a job they do in explaining the world. OK?\n\n\nWe could all make up a model. OK? Anybody with math skills could make up a model. But it doesn't do any good unless it's actually doing something to explain the world. And so basically, the goal of theoretical economics is essentially to build a model that has some testable predictions. To build a model that says, look here's my simplified model of how consumers decide whether or not to buy an iPod. OK? I have a model of that, that I've built theoretically. Well, that has some testable predictions. And the role of empirical economics is to gather the data and go and test them using statistical methods. Specifically, typically regression analysis like the kind you learn about in advanced statistics. OK?\n\n\nSo basically, what we're going to do is we're going to is 95% of this course will be about theoretical economics this semester. It will be about understanding how economists develop the models to model how consumers and firms behave. But I will try to talk somewhat about empirical economics and what data we can bring to bear to understand whether or not these models explain the world. OK?\n\n\nThe other distinction that's very important is positive versus normative economics. Positive versus normative economics. And this is the distinction between the way things are, which is positive economics, and the way things should be which is normative economics. Distinction between the way things are and the way things should be. OK? So let's consider a great example of microeconomics at\nwork which is auctions on eBay. OK? Auctions on eBay, economists love studying auctions on eBay because it's a textbook example of what we call a perfectly competitive market which is what we'll focus on the semester. A perfectly competitive market. OK?", "start": "00:25:47"}, "Heading1": {"text": "[[What is Microeconomics]]\nThe following content is provided under a Creative Commons license.

What is microeconomics? What are you going to be learning in this course? And just, sort of, set us up for the semester. OK. So basically, microeconomics is all about scarcity. It's all about how individuals and firms make decisions given that we live in a world of scarcity. Scarcity is key because basically what we're going to learn about this semester in various shapes and forms is a lot of different types of constrained optimization. We're going to learn a lot about different ways that individuals make choices in a world of scarcity. OK?\n\n\nThat is, this course is going to be about trade-offs. Given scarce resources, how the individuals and firms trade off different alternatives to make themselves as well-off as possible. That's why economics is called the dismal science. OK? It's called the dismal science because we are not about everyone have everything. We're always the people who say, no, you can't have everything. You have to make a trade- off. OK? You have to give up x to get y. And that's why people don't like us. OK? Because that's why we're called the dismal science, because we're always pointing out the trade-offs that people face.\n\n\nNow, some may call it dismal, but I call it fun. And that may be because of my MIT training, as I said I was an undergraduate here. In fact, MIT is the perfect place to teach microeconomics because this whole institute is about engineering solutions which are really ultimately about constrained optimization. Indeed, what's the best example in the world we have of this? It's the 270 contest. Right? You're given a pile of junk, you've got to build something that does something else. That's an exercise in constrained optimization.\n\n\nAll engineering is really constrained optimization. How do you take the resources you're given and do the best job building something. And that's really what microeconomics is. Just like 270 is not a dismal contest, microeconomics is not to me a dismal science. You could think of this course like 270. But instead of the building robots, we're running people's lives. OK? That's, kind of, the way I like to think about this course. Instead of trying to decide how we can build something to move a ping pong ball across a table, we're trying to decide how people make their decisions to consume, and firms make their decisions to produce. That's basically what's going to go on in this class.", "start": "00:00:00"}}
